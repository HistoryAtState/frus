                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            reception of despatches as follows: from Mr. Perry, late in charge of
                            the legation, No. 113, bearing date September 15, and No. 114, of the
                            date of September 18. From yourself, No. 53, of the date of September
                            18, and No. 54, of the date of September 20.</p>
                        <pb facs="0026" n="2" xml:id="pg_2"/>
                        <p>In the present paper I shall confine myself to so much of these
                            despatches as relates to the question of the maritime boundary of Spain
                            in the waters which surround the island of Cuba. Mr. Perry’s proceedings
                            on that question are approved, so far as their spirit and general effect
                            are concerned, but he has unfortunately erred in regard to the form of
                            proceeding he chose for referring the question to the arbitrament of his
                            Majesty the King of the Belgians. Mr. Perry has assumed, and has left
                            the Marquis of Miraflores to infer, that the President can properly make
                            the reference without first obtaining the consent of the Senate of the
                            United States. On the contrary, the United States cannot contract any
                            binding engagement whatever with a foreign power except by a solemn
                            treaty, which in every case must be submitted before ratification to the
                            Senate for its approval. This point was explicitly reserved in my note
                            to Mr. Tassara, of the 10th of August, and it ought to have been
                            distinctly brought by Mr. Perry to the notice of the Marquis of
                            Miraflores. You will please make the necessary explanation at the
                            earliest convenient moment to the Marquis. With a view to carry the
                            agreement into effect without any loss of time, I herewith send you the
                            project of a treaty, a copy whereof I have also furnished to Mr.
                            Tassara. You will submit this project to the Marquis of Miraflores, who
                            will be expected to suggest any modifications of it which he may think
                            necessary, and to give full powers to Mr. Tassara to close the
                            negotiation. When I shall have agreed with him, the treaty can then be
                            signed here, and having been duly executed, the President will promptly
                            submit it to the Senate, and ask its approval thereof. If, as the
                            President expects, that approval shall be given, the treaty will be
                            formally ratified and exchanged. When thus exchanged, it will be the
                            authority upon which his Majesty the King of the Belgians can proceed to
                            examine and determine the question, and his award will be final and
                            conclusive upon both parties.</p>
                        <p>I am not to be understood as raising any objections to the proposition of
                            the marquis that her Catholic Majesty shall address a letter to the
                            King, requesting him to assume the office of arbitration; though the
                            request must, of course, admit the reservation of the approval of the
                            measure by the Senate of the United States. A letter of that form would
                            be a proper demonstration of respect to his Majesty, and the President
                            will concur in it by addressing a similar letter to the King.</p>
                        <p>It will require due consideration on your part so to conduct this affair
                            as, in the first place, to satisfy the cabinet of Spain that the
                            departure from the course agreed upon between Mr. Perry and the Marquis
                            of Miraflores is rendered necessary by the form of our organic law; and
                            secondly, to relieve Mr. Perry of a misapprehension of our course on the
                            subject; to which end you are authorized to say to him that his error is
                            set down to the account of mere inadvertence, and does not at all
                            derogate from the highest appreciation of his ability and diligence in
                            conducting the important negotiation with which he has been charged.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of September 26, No. 56, has
                            been received, and is approved.</p>
                        <p>The note of the Marquis of Miraflores to Mr. Perry, which bears date on
                            the 18th September, was designed to define the question which is to be
                            submitted to the arbitrament of the King of Belgium, and to deprive it
                            of all uncertainty. The note is very properly conceived, yet it contains
                            one expression that may possibly tend to confuse the question. This
                            expression is found in the first paragraph, and is in these words:
                            “Seeing that she (meaning Spain) has been in peaceful possession of it,”
                            meaning the six miles of maritime jurisdiction around the island of
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Now it is proposed that for the purpose of elucidating the subject, the
                            correspondence of the two governments upon the question of the maritime
                            boundary <pb facs="0028" n="4" xml:id="pg_4"/> of Cuba shall be
                            submitted to arbitration. Of course, the above-mentioned note of the
                            Marquis of Miraflores would fall among the papers submitted to the
                            proposed royal arbiter. But this government, while it leaves her
                            Catholic Majesty free to assert that she has been in possession of the
                            belt claimed, does not by any means admit the accuracy of the assertion
                            thus made. It is very clear that the Marquis does not design to claim
                            that we have admitted it, since the fact has been controverted in our
                            part of the correspondence. You will please give a copy of this despatch
                            to the Marquis, and ask him to strike out from his note the words I have
                            quoted, or to give you a new note in which he will express his
                            acquiescence in the views I have herein presented.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of December 2, No. 67, has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>I have carefully weighed the correspondence which accompanied that paper,
                            intended to elucidate and define the maritime boundary question which is
                            to be submitted by treaty to the arbitrament of his Majesty the King of
                            the Belgians, and I accept the note of the Marquis of Miraflores as
                            excluding the idea of consent on the part of the United States to the
                            claim asserted in that respect on the part of Spain, which is all that
                            was necessary, and all that was desired, while at the same time it
                            leaves Spain at liberty to maintain the allegation. Mr. Tassara informs
                            me that he has not yet received his power to execute the treaty.</p>
                        <p>I thank you very sincerely for the interesting account you have given me
                            of the condition of domestic politics in Spain, and I have read, also,
                            with profound attention, your remarks on the proposition by the French
                            emperor of a European congress.</p>
                        <p>It is gratifying to all who are well-wishers of Spain, as we are, to know
                            that her financial and material conditions exhibit a substantial and
                            encouraging improvement.</p>
                        <p>We shall look with considerable interest for the explanation of the new
                            system of administration in Cuba which you have promised to send so soon
                            as that system is fully matured.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The telegraph will have informed you, ere
                            this, that the cabinet of Miraflores has ceased to exist. It was
                            defeated, on Friday last, by a large vote in the Senate. The question on
                            which the vote was given was one arising out of a proposition of the
                            ministry to repeal certain organic laws which had been passed in 1857
                            under the administration of General Narvaez. By the constitution of 1845
                            all senators were nominated for life by the Grown, to be taken from
                            certain classes of functionaries or from the grandees of Spain, enjoying
                            a certain fixed income from land or other stable sources. The organic
                            laws of Narvaez, called reforms, provided that the dignity of senators
                            should be hereditary in the family of grandees, upon condition, however,
                            as heretofore, the heir should have the requisite income, and, in order
                            to secure this property qualification, the grandees were permitted to
                            entail their estates.</p>
                        <p>Another of these reforms of Narvaez provided that the rules of both
                            houses of the Cortes should be established by a law, thus placing it out
                            of the power (as was alleged) of accidental majorities in either house
                            to oppress minorities by arbitrary changes of the rules. These reforms,
                            however, remained a dead letter; neither the administration of Narvaez
                            (which hardly survived the passage of the reforms) nor any of the
                            various subsequent cabinets finding it advisable to even propose a law
                            of entail for the grandees—the common law of Spain forbidding the
                            entailing of estates—nor to offer a law establishing parliamentary rules
                            for the Cortes.</p>
                        <p>The present ministry, counting upon the support of the O’Donnel party,
                            which was committed in favor of repealing the many reforms, introduced a
                            bill abolishing the provisions allowing grandees to entail, and also the
                            one which provided for a law of parliamentary rules. As it was admitted,
                            on all hands, that the said Narvaez reforms had produced no change, and
                            remained unexecuted, and would in all probability ever so remain, it is
                            very clear that the question of itself was of no great moment. The
                            ministry, however, trying to remove from the organic laws provisions
                            which had become impossible of execution, had undoubtedly the better
                            side of the question. Its motive for raising such an unsubstantial
                            question was probably to obtain some cheap popularity, as the
                            proposition to deprive the grandees of the privilege to entail, and
                            thereby prevent in many instances the inheritance of the senatorial
                            dignity, had a certain odor of liberality about it.</p>
                        <p>The measure could only have been carried by the assistance of the
                            O’Donnel party, (Union liberal,) but that party almost to a man voted
                            with their chief, O’Donnel, whose only object was to beat the ministry,
                            to which he had of late become very hostile. This conduct was of course
                            inconsistent with their former professions and pledges in regard to the
                            Narvaez reforms, but the ministry must have been very blind if they
                            counted upon political morality in any of the existing parties.</p>
                        <p>Although the adverse vote was not given directly on the bill proposed by
                            the ministry, but on a preliminary question, which showed, however,
                            pretty plainly what it would be on the main question; the Senate was
                            immediately adjourned and the ministers tendered their resignation,
                            which, under the circumstances, had to be accepted. No cabinet has been
                            formed yet. The probability is that another coalition ministry will be
                            called in, and although such an one offers no stability, yet it is
                            difficult to do anything else at present where neither the
                            conservatives, nor the <hi rend="italic">Progressistas,</hi> nor the old
                            O’Donnel compromise party, (Union liberal,) has a majority in either
                            house, or perhaps in the country. If Narvaez, as head of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Moderados,</hi> or Olazaga-Prim, as heads of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Progressistas,</hi> were to <pb facs="0031" n="7"
                                xml:id="pg_7"/> form a cabinet, the present Cortes would, at all
                            events, have to be dissolved, and an appeal made to the people. Should a
                            new election give a decided majority to the ministry, a somewhat more
                            permanent government might be expected.</p>
                        <p>Personally I regret the retirement of the Marquis of Miraflores. He was a
                            model gentleman of the old school, formal to a certain degree, yet very
                            courteous and even cordial. He was frank, and, I think, a man of honor.
                            His mental capacities were not considered very high, yet he has
                            considerable experience in public affairs, and I think he made, upon the
                            whole, a pretty good minister.</p>
                        <p>I am just informed of the formation of a new ministry; although Narvaez
                            is not in it, its complexion is “moderado.” President and minister of
                            state is Arrazola, judge of the supreme tribunal of Spain. He was a
                            cabinet minister many years ago. Minister of war is General Lersund,
                            Colonies, Alexander de Castro. The other ministers are gentlemen of whom
                            little is known outside of Spain.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>By the 9th article of the treaty of
                            Washington of the 9th of August, 1842, between the United States and
                            Great Britain, it is stipulated that the parties will unite in all
                            becoming representations and remonstrances with any and all powers
                            within whose dominions such markets [for African negroes] are allowed to
                            exist, and that they will urge upon all such powers the propriety and
                            duty of closing such markets effectually at once and forever.</p>
                        <p>Spain is believed to be the only Christian state into whose dominions
                            African negroes are now introduced as slaves. She has a treaty with
                            Great Britain stipulating for the suppression of that traffic. The
                            instrument was concluded at a time and under circumstances which, as it
                            seems to us, imposed a peculiar weight of moral obligation on Spain to
                            see that her stipulations were carried into full effect. It is
                            understood, however, that the just expectations of the British
                            government in that respect have been signally disappointed. This has no
                            doubt been mostly owing to the fact that a great part of the public
                            revenue of Spain has hitherto been derived from Cuba, the prosperity of
                            which island has in some quarters been erroneously supposed to depend
                            upon a continued supply of imported slave labor. This is believed to be
                            the source of the disregard of Cuban slave-dealers of the humane policy
                            of the home government, and the alleged inefficiency at times of the
                            colonial authorities.</p>
                        <p>We have no treaty with Spain on the subject of the slave trade; but, as
                            the laws of the United States characterized it as piracy long before our
                            treaty with Great Britain above referred to, we think ourselves entitled
                            to consider that trade an offence against public law, so far as to
                            warrant our faithful compliance with the stipulation contained in that
                            treaty. Herewith I transmit a copy of an informal note on this subject
                            of the 4th instant addressed to me by Lord Lyons, and of the papers to
                            which it refers. From these it appears that though the number of
                            Africans introduced into Cuba is diminishing, yet that the municipal
                            laws in force there require amendment before a stoppage of the traffic
                            can be expected. The peculiar relations of Great Britain to Spain with
                            reference to this topic may justify to the full extent the text of the
                            note of Sir John Crampton to the Marquis of Miraflores. The relations of
                            the United <pb facs="0032" n="8" xml:id="pg_8"/> States to Spain,
                            however, are of a different character, but the President authorizes and
                            directs you to address a communication in general terms to the Spanish
                            minister for foreign affairs, setting forth the treaty stipulations
                            between the United States and Great Britain on this subject, and stating
                            that it would afford the utmost satisfaction in this -country if any
                            obstacles existing in Cuba to the complete suppression of the African
                            slave trade should be removed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The Santo Domingo question is lately occupying very much the thoughts of
                            the reflecting portion of the nation. Some papers boldly advocate an
                            abandonment of the island. It is certain that the cabinet has been very
                            much engaged with the subject. Officials lately arrived from the theatre
                            of war have been examined by the ministers. It is reported, upon pretty
                            good authority, that a commission will be sent there to make a thorough
                            investigation into the condition of affairs. Letters from the island,
                            freely published in the papers here, represent a thorough conquest, and
                            the restoration of lasting tranquillity there, as impossible. It is easy
                            enough for the Spanish troops to subdue the insurgent places near the
                            coast, where such troops can be subsisted by the fleet. But the interior
                            is said to be so thinly peopled, so little cultivated, so densely
                            covered by primeval forests, so destitute of roads, that no armies can
                            penetrate into the country, where bands of natives can exist with ease,
                            ready to issue forth, whenever an opportunity offers, to assail the
                            Spanish posts.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the government of Hayti does its best (at least
                            apparently) to prevent encouragement and material aid being given to the
                            Santo Domingo people; but this being a war of races, and Spain being
                            feared as a neighbor in the island, it cannot, weak as it is, restrain
                            the Haytians from affording great assistance to the insurgents. Add to
                            all this the terrible climate, which is making fearful ravages in the
                            Spanish army, and it may well be believed when it is said that there is
                            hardly a man now in Spain but regrets deeply this annexation, and
                            denounces it now as a most egregious blunder. A strong and powerful
                            ministry alone, however, could take the step of abandoning the fatal
                            gift, and such a one does not at present exist, and may not exist for a
                            long time to come. In the meanwhile the finances of Spain, never very
                            flourishing, though lately improving, will suffer very greatly.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch and Prussian ministers here, as also the consul general of the
                            Hanseatic towns, have received instructions from their respective
                            governments to present claims for damages done to their shipping by the
                            bombardment of Puerto Plata by the Spanish forces. The English minister
                            has also received notice that claims will be presented. Upon the
                            supposition that the United States had similar claims I have been
                            applied to for joint action in the matter. But as I have not received
                            any information on the subject, I have of course refrained from saying
                            or doing anything.</p>
                        <p>Your circular despatch of the 12th of August, 1863, presenting succinctly
                            and forcibly a tableau of the condition of military affairs in our
                            country, and of the steady progress of the Union cause, has been
                            translated by Mr. Perry into <pb facs="0033" n="9" xml:id="pg_9"/>
                            Spanish, and has been issued in pamphlet form in a neat and elegant
                            style here in Madrid, and is now distributing. Mr. Perry has already
                            sent you some copies. It has made a favorable impression.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * *</p>
                        <p>Some time previous to the receipt of your last, Sir John Crampton had
                            called upon me, and had explained the grounds and the object of the
                            remonstrances which his government had felt itself compelled to make to
                            the Spanish government respecting certain failures in the proper
                            execution of treaty stipulations existing between Great Britain and
                            Spain as to the suppression of the slave trade. He also informed me of
                            the President’s promises to support the British reclamation according to
                            the Washington treaty. Subsequent to the receipt of your despatch upon
                            that subject I had another interview with Sir John, in which he informed
                            me of the conversation and the correspondence which he had already had
                            with the minister of state on the question, and of his prospects of
                            success.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of your despatch I have addressed a note to Señor Arrazola,
                            the minister of state, a copy of which, I have the honor to enclose. I
                            have also furnished a copy to Sir John.</p>
                        <p>Another political crisis seems to have been reached here. It is generally
                            supposed that within a few days the ministry will resign, or that they
                            will dissolve the present Cortes and appeal to the country.</p>
                        <p>As no change of administration will, in my opinion, seriously affect our
                            relations with Spain, I forbear to indulge in speculations as to the
                            probable successors of the present ministry, and as to the state of
                            politics here generally.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of the Iberia, of the 17th of this month, containing an
                            article <pb facs="0034" n="10" xml:id="pg_10"/> of General Prim, (<hi
                                rend="italic">El Condé de Reus,</hi>) in which he gives a brief
                            sketch of his journey to the United States, and dwells more particularly
                            on the great military and financial resources of the United States. The
                            Iberia being the principal organ of the great <hi rend="italic"
                                >Progressista</hi> party, and having a very wide circulation, the
                            views of the general, so favorable to the great Union cause, and so
                            flattering to our national power, cannot fail to create an excellent
                            impression among the people of Spain.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the ministry have last night tendered their
                            resignation to the Queen; whether it will be accepted, or whether the
                            Cortes will be dissolved, is not yet ascertained.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The subject of suppressing the inhuman
                                African slave trade has been one of deep anxiety to the government
                                of the United States from the time of its foundation. The United
                                States have been among the first of nations, if not the first, that
                                have denounced this traffic in human beings as piracy, and have
                                visited their own citizens implicated in it with the severest
                                penalties. At very heavy pecuniary sacrifices, and at the risk of
                                the lives of their own naval officers and seamen, they have for more
                                than twenty years supported a squadron on the western coast of
                                Africa, in a most destructive climate, in order to prevent the
                                successful carrying on of this nefarious trade.</p>
                            <p>They have, with a like view, entered into stipulations with the
                                government of her Britannic Majesty, in the year 1842, contained in
                                what is called the treaty of Washington, the 9th article of which is
                                as follows:</p>
                            <p rend="center">[Here follows the article entire.]</p>
                            <p>The attention of the President of the United States has lately been
                                directed to certain difficulties which have presented themselves,
                                and which appear to prevent a complete suppression of the slave
                                trade in the colonial possessions of her Catholic Majesty, and more
                                especially in the island of Cuba, which difficulties do not arise
                                from any desire of the Spanish colonial authorities to favor the
                                said trade. It is well known that the efforts made by the captain
                                general of that island correspond entirely to the wise and humane
                                policy which the homo government of her Catholic Majesty has adopted
                                in regard to the subject in question, and which is thoroughly
                                appreciated by the President and the people of the United States.
                                The difficulties spoken of seem to be inherent in the laws and
                                regulations in existence, which are supposed to give room to
                                interpretations by which their force may be evaded.</p>
                            <p>In view of the general policy of the United States, which looks upon
                                the African slave trade as an offence against the public law of
                                nations, and has denounced it as piracy; in view, also, of the
                                treaty stipulations existing between them and the government of her
                                Britannic Majesty, the President of the United States has instructed
                                me to respectfully call the attention of her Catholic Majesty’s
                                government to this subject, and to suggest such a revision of the
                                existing laws and regulations concerning the unlawful introduction
                                of slaves into <pb facs="0035" n="11" xml:id="pg_11"/> the island of
                                Cuba as will best accomplish the object which her Majesty’s
                                government had in view when those laws and regulations were
                                enacted.</p>
                            <p>It is hardly necessary for the undersigned to assure your excellency
                                that these suggestions arise from the purest motives, and would not
                                have been made unless the President had considered the very friendly
                                and cordial relations existing between the United States and Spain
                                as justifying this application, and had he not been bound to another
                                friendly nation by engagements which it is his duty as well as his
                                pleasure to carry out faithfully.</p>
                            <p>It is almost equally unnecessary for me to inform your excellency
                                that it would afford the utmost satisfaction to the President and
                                the people of the United States if any obstacles existing in the
                                island of Cuba to the complete suppression of the African slave
                                trade should be removed by the considerate action of the government
                                of her Catholic Majesty.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned takes great pleasure to assure, &amp;<hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On the 6th of last month a note was
                            received at this department from Mr. Tassara, requesting that a certain
                            shipment of leather accoutrements destined for Spanish troops in Cuba,
                            which had been detained at the New York custom-house, might be allowed
                            to proceed to their destination. The existence of a general order of the
                            War Department, which prohibits the exportation of arms and military
                            accoutrements, forbade a compliance with the request of Mr. Tassara. As
                            information upon this subject will probably be communicated by him to
                            his government, it is deemed proper to bring the matter to your
                            attention, in order that you may be able to explain to her Catholic
                            Majesty’s minister for foreign affairs the grounds upon which the
                            refusal of Mr. Tassara’s request was based. At the present time the
                            resources of the country are taxed to the utmost to supply our own
                            troops, and for this reason the government is compelled to enforce
                            rigidly the executive order of November 21, 1862, prohibiting the
                            exportation of arms, ammunition, and military stores. It is hardly
                            necessary to add, that under other circumstances the request of her
                            Catholic Majesty’s minister would have been most cheerfully complied
                            with.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Some weeks ago the British steamer
                            Princess, Captain St. Clair, from New Castle to Ancona, in ballast,
                            entered the port of Malaga to coal.</p>
                        <p>Suspicion being aroused, a somewhat thorough search by the port
                            authorities discovered secreted in the hold several rifled cannon,
                            revolvers, sabres, a large amount of powder, military accoutrements,
                            Congreve rockets, boarding hooks, <pb facs="0036" n="12" xml:id="pg_12"
                            /> and a box fall of signals. These articles, not being in the manifest,
                            and therefore liable to confiscation, were seized, and are now in the
                            government stores. The captain and crew were arrested, but, on the
                            guarantee of the British consul, were allowed to remain on board. An
                            embargo is laid on the ship. Captain and crew protest their innocence;
                            state that they were engaged by a Mr. Felix, <hi rend="italic"
                                >alias</hi> Captain Robson, to take charge of the ship in ballast,
                            and to take her around to Ancona, where she was to serve as a packet on
                            the Adriatic, and that they absolutely did not know what was secreted in
                            the hold.</p>
                        <p>By some it was supposed that the cargo was intended for revolutionists in
                            Spain; by others for the party of action in Italy; still by others that
                            it was to be shipped to the Danubian principalities, or to
                            Circassia.</p>
                        <p>The peculiar character of the armament, however, has led some, myself
                            included, to believe that it was meant to be transshipped to some
                            confederate pirate.</p>
                        <p>Before the Princess made Malaga she had been hovering around the coasts
                            of the Bay of Biscay and of Portugal, probably waiting for the Florida
                            from Brest, or the Rappahannock (Virginia,) which lately left England in
                            an unfinished condition.</p>
                        <p>Our vice-consul at Malaga, Mr. Geary, is watching the proceedings there
                            closely. Sir John Crampton has in a very friendly manner given me all
                            the information he himself possesses, derived from voluminous reports of
                            the British consul at Malaga. The consuls of Cadiz, Valencia, and
                            Barcelona, have received instructions to exercise the utmost vigilance
                            in their respective ports. The contraband articles are for the present
                            out of harm’s way, and will in all probability be confiscated. Feeling
                            thus secure for some time to come at least, I have not yet addressed
                            myself to the government here, awaiting further developments.</p>
                        <p>I mean, however, to have an informal conversation about the subject in my
                            next interview with the minister of state.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your interesting despatch of the 14th of
                            February, No. 76, has been received.</p>
                        <p>The war in St. Domingo is an affair which can be considered by this
                            government only with reference to the duties and obligations of the
                            United States as a member of the family of nations. The revolutionists
                            in that island have, in various forms and through several channels,
                            appealed to this government for recognition, for aid, and for sympathy.
                            Pursuing the policy we have too ineffectually insisted upon at the hands
                            of other nations, we have not received any agents of the revolution,
                            even informally, nor have we in any way responded to them, while we have
                            given instructions to ministerial officers to see that the neutrality
                            laws of the United States are regularly maintained and enforced.</p>
                        <p>You must have already received instructions from this department to
                            submit certain claims of American citizens against her Catholic
                            Majesty’s government for redress for injuries and losses sustained by
                            them, as they represent, in the military operations which have taken
                            place on the island. Those instructions <pb facs="0037" n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13"/> indicate with sufficient clearness, it is hoped,
                            the manner in which the claims are to be presented. It is thought
                            inexpedient to authorize any concert with the representatives of other
                            powers in presenting or prosecuting the claims.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had the honor of addressing you in my
                            despatch, No. 79, of the 5th instant, upon the seizure of the British
                            steamer Princess at Malaga. I did believe at the time that the Princess
                            was a confederate boat, and had taken measures accordingly. A few days
                            after sending my despatch, Sir John Crampton paid me a visit and laid
                            before me photographic copies of two letters, directed to Captain
                            Sinclair, of the Princess, which he had just obtained from the British
                            consul at Malaga, and which seem to place the matter in a different
                            light. The first is a note without signature, dated Paris, and on which
                            is imprinted the national seal of Poland. It informs Captain Sinclair
                            that Prince C. has taken proper steps to release him and the boat; that
                            Count Wohl had left with good letters of recommendation, for Madrid, and
                            that the captain would soon hear from the count. I may remark here that
                            C. stands, in all probability, for Czartorisky, Prince Wladislaew
                            Czartorisky being president of the Polish National Committee at Paris.
                            The second letter is one written from a hotel in Madrid by said Count
                            Wohl, informing the captain of his arrival, and enclosing to him for
                            present purposes two hundred dollars.</p>
                        <p>It would appear, therefore, that the Princess was fitted out in the
                            interest of the Polish revolution. The object is still a matter of some
                            mystery; I cannot well imagine it, and to me the plan of operating
                            against Austria or Russia by sea appears to be a very wild one. Yet the
                            present state of Europe offers such a labyrinth of complications that
                            even the most fantastic schemes may carry with them probabilities of
                            success.</p>
                        <p>In order to find out, if possible, what steps have been taken by this
                            Count Wohl here in Madrid in respect to the boat and crew, and to make
                            myself still more certain of the true character of the persons
                            interested in the enterprise, I had an interview with the minister of
                            state, Señor Pacheco. He said he had no knowledge of any agent having
                            arrived here. No one had approached him on the subject. It was a matter,
                            however, which belonged to the minister of finance. He thought, from
                            what he had heard, that the Princess was chartered on Polish account.
                            The Russian minister had been to see him about it. The cargo, he
                            thought, and perhaps the boat too, would be confiscated.</p>
                        <p>I have, however, still advised our vice-consul at Malaga to watch
                            proceedings there closely and to report to me everything of importance.
                            Mr. Ruiz Geary, the vice-consul, has done very well, and shown an
                            intelligent zeal in the matter. To Sir John feel under great
                            obligations. He has made it a point to give me all information in his
                            possession at the earliest moment, and on this, like all other
                            occasions, has shown none but the best feelings for our country.</p>
                        <p>I think the idea of retiring from San Domingo is growing stronger here
                            every day. It undoubtedly would be the wisest policy, but none except a
                            strong ministry will be equal to the task, and such a one does not at
                            present exist. There is much ability in the cabinet, but its strength in
                            the Cortes has not yet been tested.</p>
                        <p>The Archduke Maximilian has just returned to Miramare, and in a few days
                                <pb facs="0038" n="14" xml:id="pg_14"/> will formally accept the
                            Mexican crown and assume the title of the “Emperor of the Mexicans.”
                            Ambassadors and ministers will be immediately sent to the European
                            powers before he embarks. The name of the person designed to represent
                            him here is already given in the papers. I would thank you for an
                            intimation as to the manner in which you desire me to regulate my
                            conduct towards him. He will, of course, make me an official visit.
                            Shall it be returned officially, or only privately?</p>

                            the Secretary of the Navy, calling attention to certain facilities
                            extended by the Spanish Admiral Don F. Pavia to the commander of the
                            United States steamer Wyoming, in allowing that vessel to be repaired
                            and replenished with coal at the Spanish naval depot at the port of
                            Cavite. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in this letter, you are

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The new ministry has lately carried in the Senate a law by which, in
                            principle, the hereditary right of grandees of Spain to have, under
                            certain conditions, a seat in the Senate, has been abolished. There is,
                            however, a reservation in the law which secures the right to persons who
                            have it now, but have not actually taken their seats in the Senate,
                            either by reason of their minority or some other cause. As the majority
                            in the Senate was very large, there seems to be no doubt of the House of
                            Deputies adopting the measure also. I look upon the changes as of no
                            consequence. There were but few grandees who could enter by mere
                            inheritance, as to do so required also a yearly fixed income of $10,000,
                            which few had; besides, it is doubtful whether the Senate would not have
                            gained by having at least some members in it who did not owe their
                            office to the nomination of the government. Yet even the liberals in
                            Spain, a good deal like their neighbors in France, seem to care much
                            more about equality than about liberty, not reflecting that in a pure
                            despotism there is really the greatest equality, all being equally
                            slaves. A Senate composed exclusively of a privileged class would secure
                            the rights of the people a great deal better than one which is entirely
                            filled up by the nomination of the Crown.</p>
                        <p>It is stated here in various journals, which are likely to receive
                            information from ministerial circles, that Mr. Preston has gone to
                            Mexico to establish commercial relations with the new empire, and to
                            procure its recognition of the Confederate States. It is also said in
                            some of the papers that Spain has entered into a treaty with the new
                            emperor, reserving the throne of Mexico, in case of failure of issue, to
                            a Spanish prince. This would be an important fact if true, as it would
                            secure the moral co-operation of Spain in the establishment of the new
                            empire, and would have a tendency to place Spain in a somewhat
                            antagonistic position to the United States. That Spain, in the end,
                            would be cheated of her expectations I have no doubt; but still it is
                            not altogether improbable that some inducements have been held out to
                            her, which may have some present effect.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, sir, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p>The resolutions of the House of Representatives at Washington, protesting
                            against a monarchy in Mexico, under European auspices, has caused
                            surprise in diplomatic circles and a good deal of sensation in the
                            press. It is generally supposed that the attitude assumed by the House
                            will produce complications with France, and may lead to a war. As far as
                            Spain is concerned, there are in fact very few persons in favor of the
                            new empire under Maximilian; some indeed, who would otherwise have been
                            in favor of French policy in America, and who generally take their ideas
                            from France, being disappointed in this instance because a Spanish
                            prince was not selected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In your despatch of March 20, No. 82, you
                            mention the probability that the Archduke Maximilian, on assuming the
                            title of Emperor over Mexico, <pb facs="0041" n="17" xml:id="pg_17"/>
                            will accredit a representative to the court of her Catholic Majesty, and
                            you ask directions how to regulate your conduct towards the person who
                            may be so accredited.</p>
                        <p>It is the policy of the United States to refrain from recognizing
                            revolutionary governments. It has not recognized any revolutionary
                            government in Mexico, while it has justly respected the belligerent
                            rights of the parties engaged in war in that country. You will, of
                            course, follow the policy which prevails here; and you will hold no
                            official intercourse with any representative at Madrid of any
                            revolutionary government that has been or shall be established against
                            the authority of the government of the United States of Mexico, with

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Tour despatch of the 27th of March, No. 85,
                            has been received. Your proceedings therein related, in reference to the
                            denial of Mr. Tassara’s request in the matter of equipments, and also
                            your views in the matter of Mr. Cazneau’s claim on the Spanish
                            government, are approved.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the interesting information you have given concerning
                            existing domestic questions in Spain.</p>
                        <p>It is true that Mr. Preston has gone to Mexico, as a pretended legate of
                            the insurgents, to the so-called regency of the empire. They are very
                            enterprising in diplomacy, but their success there is not greatly to be
                            feared, unless they should retrieve misfortunes sustained on the
                            battle-field. Spain has heretofore had opportunity to understand the
                            slaveholders of the United States. It is not less her own interest than
                            it is ours that she shall not suffer herself to be misled by them. What
                            resistance could Mexico, now or at any future time, offer, with even
                            European aid, against the slaveholding power of the United States, if it
                            could escape destruction and attain independence in the present civil
                            war?</p>

                            from the Navy Department, was received last night. The instruction it
                            contains as to expressing the thanks of the government of the United
                            States to Spanish Admiral Don D. Pavia, through the appropriate channel,
                            will receive my prompt attention.</p>
                        <p>The house of deputies of the Cortes have adopted the constitutional
                            changes lately passed in the senate by a very large majority; by this
                            proceeding hereditary peerage has been abolished, and the two houses are
                            left free to prescribe their own rules, which, under the former
                            enactment of 1857, were to be regulated by a law which required the
                            action of both houses, and the assent of the crown. The effect of the
                            recent changes is there-establishment of the constitution of 1845.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Mon, the president of the ministry, has expressed himself in the
                            Cortes a few days ago, in the same manner, and almost in the same
                            language, as to the question of St. Domingo, as Mr. Pacheco did to me in
                            the late conversation which I had the honor to report to you. The houses
                            seemed to acquiesce in his views. The independent press, nevertheless,
                            denounces the annexation and the attempt to enforce it at the terrible
                            cost of blood and treasure.</p>
                        <p>The steamer Princess, detained at Malaga, and of which I have spoken in
                            several of my despatches, has been confiscated by the Spanish
                            government, as I have been informed, though the information is not

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Despatch No. 76, with memorandum on
                            “Talambo question,” between Peru and Spain, and despatch No. 78, (no
                            number 77 having been received,) arrived here day before yesterday.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of the instructions contained in No. 76, I had an interview
                            with Mr. Pacheco, in which I informed him of the great interest our
                            government felt in seeing amicable relations sustained between Spain and
                            the republican governments of America, and that for this reason the
                            difficulty which had arisen between Spain and Peru had been viewed with
                            regret on our part. That while it was not the intention of the
                            government to interfere in the dispute, there was a desire to smooth
                            down (<hi rend="italic">applanir</hi>) disagreements, and to prevent
                            interruption of friendship, and our good offices were offered cordially
                            for such a purpose. It appeared to my government that the demands made
                            by Admiral Pinzon on the Peruvian authorities for redress were somewhat
                            too strong and calculated to wound the feelings of self-respect and
                            national dignity of Peru.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pacheco seemed to receive what I said very well. He remarked that his
                            government was very far from wishing hostilities with Peru, or any other
                            power, That nothing would be asked but a <hi rend="italic">bona
                                fide</hi> trial and punishment of the offenders; that his government
                            could not permit people to be killed for no other reason than that they
                            were Spaniards; that he did not know the terms in which Admiral Pinzon
                            had claimed redress; they were, of course, his own, and had not been
                            suggested to him by the government, which at the time knew nothing of
                            the matter. As those terms were unknown to the government here, they had
                            of course, not approved them, or expressed any opinion about them. That
                            the admiral had no more to do with it. Mr. Salazar had been sent out
                            with full instructions by the cabinet which had preceded him, (Mr.
                            Pacheco,) and could hardly have arrived as yet at Callao. That as the
                            conversation was confidential, he would tell me that the instructions
                            given to Señor Salazar were not of a character to promote hostilities;
                            that since he had come into office he had also given instructions, of
                            which I might be assured that they were not of a nature to produce a
                            conflict. He said he was obliged for the offer of our good services, and
                            they would not be refused, though he did not think there was any subject
                            for mediation existing.</p>
                        <p>This is about the substance of the conversation as it passed a few hours
                            ago, and which was, as I had intimated to the minister at the beginning,
                            altogether confidential and informal. It is said—but this I state on
                            information merely <pb facs="0043" n="19" xml:id="pg_19"/> the minister
                            not having made any remark to that effect, or even said anything to me
                            from which it might be inferred—that the first instructions given to
                            Señor Salazar by Mr. Anozola, the late minister president, were of a
                            menacing or aggressive character, but that the moment Mr. Pacheco came
                            into office he despatched a special messenger after Mr. Salazar with new
                            instructions, considerably modifying the first in their tone and
                            purport. This is not improbable. Mr. Pacheco is, I take it, a man of
                            peace, much inclined to conciliate matters. This is his reputation, and
                            I find it to be correct, as far as my limited experience goes. Besides,
                            it is hardly probable that he should have given, within so short a time,
                            new instructions to Señor Salazar, if he had been quite satisfied with
                            the first. I will watch the proceedings in Peru now with attention, and
                            not fail, should occasion require, to renew the efforts to prevent a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have received your despatch of April 10,
                            No. 87, and I have read with much interest the account it gives of a
                            conversation between yourself and Mr. Pacheco on the subject of the
                            civil war in St. Domingo. It is, indeed, very hard for a state to
                            reverse its step sand retreat from a position that has been deliberately
                            taken in the face of opposition and resistance. There is nothing more
                            sensitive than national honor. Nevertheless, I shall be surprised if it
                            do not appear in the sequel that every attempt to restore European
                            dominion in America ends in disappointment. That disappointment may be
                            delayed until the successful close of our own troubles shall allow the
                            prestige of the United States to be restored. A republic, like every
                            other institution, has its perils to encounter, and its penalties to pay
                            for yielding to jealousies, supineness, and faction.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of April 18, No. 88, and to thank you for the
                            information it gives concerning the constitutional reforms which have
                            been adopted in Spain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Romaine, the minister of Hayti, has just returned from Port au Prince
                            to the United States. He represents the struggle in which the Spaniards
                            are engaged with the Dominicans as being a very difficult one, without
                            good assurance <pb facs="0044" n="20" xml:id="pg_20"/> of results. His
                            government thinks that its kind offices might be useful in effecting a
                            settlement upon terms which, while saving the honor of Spain, would at
                            the same time secure the independence of Dominica. But Mr. Romaine says
                            that his government, conscious of its want of prestige, would desire to
                            secure the sanction and co-operation of the United States, Great Britain
                            and France. I have told him that our best wishes would go with the
                            Haytian government in such an enterprise, although it is not now seen
                            how, with our settled principles and habits, we could formally unite
                            with European powers in any movement that would connect us as an ally or
                            associate with any or all of the powers concerned. Mr. Romaine intimates
                            a belief that the government of Spain has been chiefly moved in its
                            attempt to re-establish its power in Dominica by an apprehension that
                            the United States are only waiting an opportunity to seize for
                            themselves the bay of Samana. It would be unfortunate for the Dominicans
                            if this feeling on the part of Spain should prevent a restoration of
                            their independence and freedom. I do not think the government of the
                            United States has ever seriously designed to ravish the bay of Samana
                            from the comparatively feeble people to whom it belonged, although I am
                            aware that schemes for the purchase of that bay were heretofore
                            entertained by some parties connected with this government, in the times
                            when its policy was attempted to be directed towards the acquisition of
                            Cuba, Mexico, and Central America, with a view to the establishment of a
                            slaveholders’ dominion on the shores and islands of the Gulf of Mexico.
                            No one can speak for the indefinite political future of that region, as
                            indeed there is a boundary beyond which statesmen cannot hope to control
                            the future of their own country, much less the future of foreign states.
                            It is manifestly not only wise, but even necessary, to leave to
                            after-coming statesmen the consideration of questions which are distant
                            and purely contingent. The existing agitations in Europe illustrate this
                            truism. I can speak with some confidence, however, for this government
                            at present, and so long as it shall be occupied with the interests and
                            ideas with which the American people are now practically engaged, I can
                            very confidently say that the United States are not seeking nor desiring
                            any conquest here or abroad, and that, on the contrary, they seek and
                            desire nothing more in regard to any part of America than that it may
                            safely remain, under the care of its own people, in the enjoyment of
                            republican institutions. The United States already have abundant
                            territory, and all that they can improve. They believe that their
                            position would be strengthened more by the establishment of free and
                            indedendent governments on the continents and islands of America, than
                            by an extension of their now already very large domain. But it is worthy
                            of consideration that moderation is as justly expected by us from Spain,
                            as by Spain from us. If she insist on holding Samana, while surrendering
                            the rest of Dominica, simply for the purpose of preventing the United
                            States from lawfully acquiring it at a future day, can she be surprised
                            if the United States regard her as asking them to disclaim an ambition,
                            the indulgence of which would be as lawful for them as for herself?</p>
                        <p>I give you these instructions confidentially, that you may use them
                            informally, if you find reason to believe that by doing so you can favor
                            the cause of freedom and humanity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I give you for your information a copy of
                            two despatches, which have just been received from Mr. Robinson, our
                            minister in Peru, upon the subject of the disturbed relations existing
                            between that country and Spain.</p>
                        <p>I have already authorized you to say to Mr. Pacheco that the President
                            feels a deep interest in the preservation of peace between these
                            countries. I have now to enjoin upon you as earnest an exertion of your
                            good offices in that matter as shall be consistent with the sincere
                            respect and courtesy which are entertained by this country towards
                            Spain. It would not be any more useful than it would be becoming for the
                            United States to assume a right to investigate the circumstances which
                            are understood to threaten a collision. They will confine themselves to
                            the expression of a hope, that both nations may both be willing to each
                            confer in a spirit of conciliation, so long as no sacrifice of any
                            important right or of honor may be exacted on either side. Mr. Pacheco
                            need hardly be informed that the United States are enduring, not without
                            profound sadness and sorrow, the calamities of civil war, and that their
                            best efforts are directed to bring that unhappy conflict to a close as
                            speedily as possible in the only form consistent with the integrity of
                            the American republic. They deplore the war which is exhausting the
                            neighboring state of Mexico, and they witness with pain the scenes of
                            strife that are now exhibited in Dominica. While they do not falter in
                            performing their duty as neutrals in the two foreign wars I have
                            mentioned, they think it not improper to exert every effort they can to
                            favor the return of peace, and to prevent the spread of war over regions
                            of the American continent which are yet safe from its visitation. The
                            President of the United States has on many recent occasions manifested
                            his sincere desire to respect the position which Spain held at home, as
                            well as the position she held in America, when our own unhappy civil war
                            began; and to conduct our necessary correspondence with the Spanish
                            government in such a manner that when that strife shall come to an end,
                            it shall leave no sentiments of alienation or discord between the two
                            countries. This desire is no less earnestly entertained now than it has
                            been heretofore. It is hardly necessary, however, to say, that there is
                            a sympathy which has long existed, and which constantly gains growth and
                            strength, between the South American nations on this continent and the
                            United States, and that it is hoped, on our part, that Spain will think
                            it wise, as well as liberal, to regard with complacency and favor the
                            progress and development of those States; partly, because that progress
                            reflects honor upon Spain herself, by whom most of them were instituted
                            as colonies, and in some measure because they are, and must continue
                            ever hereafter to be, neighbors and friends, in whose welfare the United
                            States are deeply interested.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of April 24, No. 89, has been
                            received. The diligence and good judgment which you have exhibited in
                            executing my instruction to <pb facs="0046" n="22" xml:id="pg_22"/> use
                            your good offices to secure a continuance of friendly relations between
                            Spain and Peru are regarded by the President with special
                            approbation.</p>
                        <p>The answer of Mr. Pacheco to your representations on that occasion is
                            liberal and honorable, and encourages a hope that the accommodation
                            desired may be effected without serious difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I notice your request for specific instructions concerning a basis upon
                            which such an accommodation would be advised by this government. On the
                            contrary, my No. 88 will have shown you that I still adhere to the
                            opinion, that in a matter between two friendly governments, in which the
                            United States have no direct interest, and therefore no other right to
                            intrude except the good feelings they cherish for both the parties
                            concerned, it is most suitable to refrain from taking cognizance of the
                            exact controversy which is to be adjusted. The information you give me
                            confirms this opinion, since it assures me that Spain wants only that
                            her subjects in Peru, when accused, have a fair and just trial; and I
                            understand that Peru has already conceded, or at least that she is
                            willing to concede, this reasonable demand on the part of Spain, as it
                            is defined by Mr. Pacheco.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had only just closed my despatch of the
                            16th instant, No. 90, when information reached me of the very important
                            events that have occurred in Peru, namely, the suspension of the
                            diplomatic intercourse between the diplomatic agent of Spain at Lima,
                            and the Peruvian government, the seizure of the Chincha islands and some
                            Peruvian vessels by the Spanish squadron, and the preparations made by
                            that government for resistance and defence.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian government has now distinctly invoked the good offices of
                            the United States. I have suggested to them the expediency of sending a
                            special agent to Madrid, invested with ample powers to give all just
                            satisfaction to Spain in case the public property of the republic should
                            be restored, and the agent by whose direction it was seized shall be
                            withdrawn or relieved. Such a proposition, if made by Peru, would seem
                            to be a very reasonable one at this distance, and in the absence of any
                            special knowledge of the views of the Spanish government. Nevertheless
                            if Spain should be disposed to maintain peace and friendly relations
                            with Peru, and should yet find insuperable objections to the course I
                            have indicated, there would still remain the measure of a reference to
                            some friendly power, which the President would very cheerfully recommend
                            to Peru, as he would any other alternative that Spanish honor might
                            justly claim, and Peru could accept with due self-respect.</p>
                        <p>At an early stage of this question I took measures to engage the
                            attention of the government of France, and the last advices from Mr.
                            Dayton inform us that that government has advised the Spanish government
                            to adopt a conciliatory policy. I have now again instructed Mr. Dayton
                            to renew his good offices there in view of the violent culmination of
                            the controversy which has taken place at Lima. I give you a copy of that
                            instruction, together with a copy of the documents which have been
                            transmitted to me by our minister at Lima.</p>
                        <p>It remains only to commend the subject to your earnest attention, and to
                            assure you that if you shall be able to contribute in any degree to the
                            preservation of peace between two countries which the United States are
                            accustomed to regard with special friendship, you will have crowned your
                            mission with success that will be most gratifying to the President and
                            to the friends of freedom and liberty in the world.</p>

                            arisen between Spain and Peru, there is one suggestion which, while it
                            is my duty to make it, I desire to submit in a manner as entirely
                            inoffensive as possible to the government of Spain, and to the other
                            maritime powers of Europe. I have, therefore, reserved it for
                            communication in this separate and confidential note.</p>
                        <p>If we can safely infer anything concerning the deliberate intentions of
                            Spain from your despatches to this government, and by the declarations
                            made by the Spanish special commissioner and the Spanish admiral when
                            they seized the Chincha islands, it is that Spain does not desire or
                            design to carry her proceedings <pb facs="0048" n="24" xml:id="pg_24"/>
                            to the extreme of open war. Nevertheless, when reprisals are made,
                            neither one nor both of the parties can be certain of their ability to
                            confine the consequences within the limits previously fixed. Nor is it
                            to be forgotten that Peru, in appealing to the United States and to
                            other friendly nations, is at liberty to argue that Spain, by adopting
                            the measure of reprisals, precipitately and unnecessarily, as Peru
                            contends, manifests a purpose to overthrow the independence of that
                            country, and subvert its government This argument derives at least
                            apparent support from the recital of the Spanish agents of the fact that
                            Spain has not acknowledged Peru, and the assertion that upon some
                            principle, not fully explained, Spain can rightfully recover her ancient
                            property in the Chincha islands.</p>
                        <p>It will be your duty to make it known to her Catholic Majesty’s
                            government that the United States cannot yield their assent to the
                            positions thus assumed in the name of Spain, or regard with indifference
                            an attempt to reduce Peru by conquest and re-annex its territory to the
                            kingdom of Spain.</p>
                        <p>This government, seriously pre-occupied with domestic affairs, has deemed
                            it prudent and just, and has found it possible thus far, to hold itself,
                            as well as the whole American people, absolutely neutral in two wars
                            which are waged by European states in portions of America. I refer to
                            the war of France against Mexico, and to the civil war to which Spain is
                            a party in the island of St. Domingo. This government has been able to
                            practice this neutrality and enforce its observance upon American
                            citizens, because all the maritime powers of Europe, while they have
                            constantly assured the United States of their purpose to maintain
                            neutrality in our own unhappy civil war, have also disclaimed designs of
                            political conquest in America. Several of the South American republican
                            states, however, naturally sympathizing, as they must, with the republic
                            of Mexico, and with the revolutionists of Spanish St. Domingo, allege,
                            on the contrary, that several of the European states, which once had
                            colonies here, are now seeking to reduce them again to the condition of
                            dependencies. These apprehensions are not unlikely to be entertained by
                            the whole people of the United States. The proceedings of Spain in Peru
                            give them color which is deeply to be regretted. Indeed a general
                            discontent with the forbearance of the government is already manifest.
                            Should the sentiment of this country demand a reconsideration of the
                            policy of neutrality which the government has hitherto maintained, it is
                            very much to be feared that new complications might arise, which would
                            not merely disturb the existing systems of commerce, but might endanger
                            the general peace of nations. I need not enlarge upon the subject I have
                            thus presented. It was fully discussed by me, when, in an early stage of
                            our civil war, I endeavored to set forth the evils which it was foreseen
                            here must result from any favor shown by the maritime powers to the
                            existing insurrection in the United States. Subsequent events have not
                            impaired the arguments which were then presented. The United States are
                            no more prepared now than they were then to surrender either their own
                            integrity or their proper position in the family of nations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>With reference to the instructions that
                            have of late been addressed to you upon the subject of the controversy
                            between Peru and Spain, which has resulted in the seizure of the Chincha
                            islands by the latter, I enclose a translation of a note to this
                            department of the 17th instant, from Mr. Barreda, the minister of Peru
                            here, in which, as you will observe, he asks leave to purchase and arm
                            vessels-of-war in the United States for the purpose of protecting the
                            coasts and guano islands of that republic. This at least shows a
                            disposition, on the part of Peru, not to acquiesce in the proceedings of
                            Spain referred to, so long as those powers are at peace; and supposing
                            that the ships desired were to be used for defensive purposes only,
                            there might not be an infringement of the neutrality act of the 20th of
                            April, 1810, in acceding to the request of Mr. Barreda, provided that
                            the same liberality should be exercised towards Spain, and all other
                            foreign powers, whose relations towards the United States are the same
                            with those which Spain and Peru, respectively, maintain towards this
                            government. If your discretion shall approve this suggestion, you may
                            intimate to the Spanish minister for foreign affairs that such a request
                            has been made, and make such use of the occasion as may lead to a
                            diplomatic adjustment of the controversy before either party shall have
                            recourse to arms. Of course, you will not be expected to execute this
                            instruction if, when it shall reach you, war shall have been declared or
                            have broken out between Spain and Peru, or if you shall find reasons to
                            think its execution would embarrass rather than facilitate the
                            restoration of amicable relations between the two powers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>A few days after sending my last despatch,
                            No. 96, of May 15, news was received here by the government, and
                            published in The Journal, which made it highly probable that hostilities
                            between Spain and Peru were on the point of breaking out. I lost no time
                            in addressing a note to Mr. Pacheco, in which I again offered, as I had
                            done in my previous conversation with him, reported to you in my
                            despatch 89, the services of our government to prevent a rupture, and to
                            reconcile conflicting claims. I have the honor of enclosing you a copy
                            of my note to the minister, dated May 20, 1864.</p>
                        <pb facs="0050" n="26" xml:id="pg_26"/>
                        <p>On yesterday I received Mr. Pacheco’s reply, of which I send you a
                            translated copy.</p>
                        <p>It will be perceived that the minister, on the strength of the events
                            which have come to his knowledge since my interview with him, the
                            refusal on the part of the Peruvian government to receive Mr. Salazar,
                            the Spanish envoy, and to negotiate with him, now declines the
                            interposition or mediation of the United States or any other friendly
                            power. I do not exactly see the force of his reasoning, If it was
                            consistent with Spanish honor for our government to use its endeavors to
                            make Peru listen to reasonable demands on the part of Spain, it must be
                            equally so if our government would try to make Peru treat with Mr.
                            Salazar, or to give satisfactory explanations for not having done so.
                            Our good offices, it strikes me, might have been exercised in the one
                            case as well as in the other.</p>
                        <p>I do not intend, however, to press the matter any further for the
                            present, for several reasons, one of which is that I consider our
                            government still perfectly free to use its influence with Peru, in
                            making that country do what may be considered right and proper.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Some time ago I had the honor of
                                communicating to your excellency, in an informal and confidential
                                manner, the apprehension felt by the government of the United States
                                of possible difficulties of a serious character between the
                                government of her Catholic Majesty and the republic of Peru, and the
                                great desire entertained on the part of the United States to prevent
                                hostilities from breaking out between two nations, towards both of
                                which they have none but the most friendly and disinterested
                                feeling.</p>
                            <p>I informed your excellency that the government of the United States
                                would be happy if it could make itself instrumental in smoothing
                                down these difficulties unhappily existing between the two
                                powers.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency expressed yourself pleased with the remarks which I
                                had offered, and intimated that if the circumstances should permit
                                of an exercise of our good offices in this complication they would
                                not be refused. Inasmuch, however, as you were at the time without
                                information as regarded the success of the mission of Señor Salazar,
                                her Majesty’s special envoy to Peru, and the steps which had been
                                taken by Admiral Pinzon, you were not, at the period of our
                                interview, in a position to express yourself definitively on the
                                proposition which I had been instructed to mention to you
                                informally. I have received no additional despatches on the subject
                                from my government since that interview; but having learned from the
                                public journals that the arrival of Señor Salazar at Peru, and his
                                proceedings, whatever they were, have failed to lead to negotiations
                                promising a peaceful settlement of the existing controversies, and
                                that, on the contrary, hostilities are imminent, if they have not
                                already broken out, I deem it consonant with my former instructions
                                to again repeat, in a confidential manner, the offer of the
                                government which I represent to use its best exertions for a
                                satisfactory settlement of the questions in dispute.</p>
                            <p>The government of the United States will cheerfully, I believe,
                                support any demand on the part of her Catholic Majesty’s government
                                founded on the <pb facs="0051" n="27" xml:id="pg_27"/> principles of
                                justice, equity, and international law, and will use its best
                                efforts to persuade and induce the Peruvian government to comply
                                with all such demands.</p>
                            <p>I have no doubt the influence of the United States would be very
                                great with the Peruvian government, and that its exercise might be
                                beneficial to both countries which are now at disagreement.</p>
                            <p>I embrace this opportunity of repeating to your excellency the
                                assurance of my highest consideration, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have had the honor to receive the
                                confidential note which you were pleased to address me on the 20th
                                instant, in which, referring to a private interview which you had
                                with me, you have been pleased to renew the indications which you
                                then addressed to me in the name of your government in respect to
                                the good dispositions which animate the cabinet of Washington to
                                contribute, by their mediation, to the arrangement of the
                                difficulties pending with the republic of Peru, lending their
                                support with pleasure to any reclamation of Spain founded on
                                principles of justice and equity, and endeavoring to persuade the
                                government of Peru to satisfy all such as may have this
                                character.</p>
                            <p>The report you make of what occurred in the interview referred to is
                                exact, and on that occasion, having in view the circumstances of the
                                affair—the subject of our conversation—and considering also the
                                state of it at that time, I could not do less than reply to the
                                friendly and loyal offer which you made me in the name of your
                                government, stating in that confidential way in which we were
                                proceeding that the government of her Majesty was disposed to
                                accept, if not the mediation, at least the good offices of the
                                government of Washington, so as to arrive at an end which
                                corresponded completely to the views of the government of her
                                Majesty, always desirous to avoid conflicts with the Spanish
                                American States.</p>
                            <p>The same disposition which I then made known to you would continue to
                                exist to-day if the conditions and the situation of the affair were
                                the same, and I should have taken pleasure in fixing in writing the
                                statements which on that occasion I had the honor to address to you;
                                but, unfortunately, it has not thus happened, and the government of
                                her Majesty deeply laments it. Things have advanced, and the affair
                                has taken a different aspect from what it then had.</p>
                            <p>Before the question of the reclamations against the Peruvian
                                government, there has arisen another, which must be considered as
                                independent and preliminary; so much the more grave, inasmuch as it
                                affects more the decorum and dignity of Spain. I refer to the
                                non-reception of the envoy Señor Salazar y Mozarredo, with whom the
                                government of Peru has refused to treat.</p>
                            <p>It cannot be hidden from your good judgment that by this act, whose
                                nature you will know how to appreciate, a state of things has been
                                created whose solution is no longer susceptible of being moulded to
                                the same conditions which appeared, and which we both considered
                                attainable at our said interview. The question is not now upon
                                principles of justice ignored, nor of material interests wounded,
                                but upon an act which, as it may be interpreted to signify a purpose
                                not to lend an ear to reason, involves an offence to Spain such as
                                makes it incumbent <pb facs="0052" n="28" xml:id="pg_28"/> upon the
                                government which rules her destinies alone to demand satisfaction.
                                If, in order to obtain this, the mediation of another friendly
                                government should be accepted, that of her Majesty would furnish a
                                motive for attributing to impotence what in any case would be only a
                                desire to avoid extreme measures, and persuaded on my part that you
                                will recognize the force of this observation, I do not doubt you
                                will know how to explain to your government the special causes which
                                place that of her Majesty in the situation of not being able to
                                accept the mediation nor the good offices of any friendly power in
                                the question pending between Spain and Peru.</p>
                            <p>The government of the Queen feels grateful beyond measure for the
                                good desires of the cabinet of Washington, and certainly it would
                                have been most pleasing if those circumstances had not intervened
                                which now impede their contributing with their prudence and
                                recognized wisdom to the termination of the affair which is the
                                subject of this writing.</p>
                            <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you the assurance of
                                my most distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p>I have been surprised to learn, by copy of your despatch 69, of February
                            25, <hi rend="italic">a. c.,</hi> that Mr. Tassara had received no
                            instructions to sign the convention by which the King of the Belgians
                            was appointed to arbitrate the question of maritime jurisdiction in the
                            waters of Cuba between the United States and Spain.</p>
                        <p>It was on the 17th of November last that the Marquis of Miraflores
                            informed me that the draught of the convention had been examined, and
                            that he had, after having suggested some very slight modification,
                            calculated to make the nature of the question still plainer, instructed
                            Mr. Tassara to sign the convention. The Marquis remained in office until
                            the middle of January following, and he never gave me the least
                            intimation as to any change in his views on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I shall take the first opportunity to ascertain whether the omission to
                            send instructions was merely accidental, or owing to a change of
                            policy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had hardly finished my No. 97, giving an
                            account of my action respecting the Peruvian troubles, when I received
                            your despatches 86, 87, 88, and 89. Your No. 88, marked confidential,
                            referring to the same subject, enjoins upon me “as earnest an exertion
                            of my good offices in that matter as shall be consistent with the
                            sincere respect and courtesy which are entertained by this country
                            towards Spain.”</p>
                        <p>On the same evening the journals contained telegraphic despatches dated
                            Panama, May 10, transmitted by the Spanish consul at Southampton to the
                            government here, to the effect that the Spanish squadron had occupied
                            fourteen islands of the Chincha archipelago, taking prisoners the
                            governor and officers; that the squadron had then gone to Callao to
                            surprise the Peruvian squadron, which, however, had escaped and taken
                            shelter under the forts; that great agitation prevailed in Peru; a loan
                            had been authorized; that land and sea forces were to be raised,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c.; that the English, American, and Bolivian ministers had
                            held a meeting at Lima, had declared themselves in favor of Peru, and
                            had determined to petition their respective governments for an immediate
                            intervention to regulate the difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch and this telegraphic news made me change the determination
                            which I had formed after I had received Mr. Pacheco’s note, and which
                            was, as I informed you in my last despatch, to take no further action in
                            this matter, at least for the present. * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In reply to your despatch No. 87, of the
                            6th of May, 1864, which refers to the proposition of the government of
                            Hayti to offer its mediation in <pb facs="0054" n="30" xml:id="pg_30"/>
                            the conflict between Spain and the people of Santo Domingo, and the
                            suggestion of the Haytian government, for the United States, England,
                            and France to support this proffered mediation, I beg leave to submit
                            some remarks.</p>
                        <p>It is generally supposed here, in official and unofficial circles, that
                            Hayti, if not at the bottom of the insurrection of the Dominicans, is,
                            at least, aiding it. It is true that Mr. Madion, the minister resident
                            of Hayti at this court, is protesting against this assumption, and does
                            his best to remove this impression, but with little success.</p>
                        <p>I have not the slightest idea that Spain will accept any sort of
                            mediation on the part of Hayti, nor indeed on the part of any other
                            power, France, perhaps, excepted. * * * *</p>
                        <p>I do not think that the present struggle to subdue the insurrection in
                            Santo Domingo owes its existence and continuance to any fear or jealousy
                            of the United States. Most statesmen of Europe have long since formed
                            the opinion that for years to come we will lack the power of aggression,
                            even if the Union were reconstructed, which, as a general thing, they
                            all disbelieve.</p>

                        <p>I found, however, Mr. More, the prime minister. I asked him whether the
                            government had heard from Mr. Salazar about his late proceedings. He
                            said no;| they expected to get news from him in about four or five days,
                            and that before that time he could not answer my questions positively,
                            whether the government would approve of his course or not. He said that
                            I might assure my government, however, that Spain had not the slightest
                            intention to reacquire any of its ancient colonies, or to encroach upon
                            the independence of Peru. “Suppose,” I asked him, “that the documents
                            published in the Peruvian papers, and republished here to-day in the
                            journals, are the only ones existing, and are correctly given; and
                            suppose that the acts of Salazar and Pinzon were as reported, and Peru
                            has done nothing to aggravate affairs since Salazar left Lima, and
                            before he commenced those hostile acts; is the government prepared to
                            approve of his proceeding?” He said he could only repeat what he had
                            already said, and that it was difficult to give any positive answer
                            before hearing from their own officers.</p>
                        <p>I send you a slip from the Official Gazette, containing Mr. Pacheco’s
                            remarks in the Cortes. He is guarded; but, nevertheless, it is easy to
                            read between the lines the disapproval of the course of Salazar and
                            Pinzon.</p>
                        <p>Public opinion here and the entire press of all parties seem to be
                            opposed to the action of Salazar from the beginning. I think I am not
                            alone here among the foreign diplomatists who take an interest in this
                            Peruvian question. The English minister told me he would undoubtedly be
                            instructed to interfere. He views the course of the Spanish agents in
                            Peru in the same light as I do. France will strongly advise peace, I
                            have no doubt, and I believe will offer her mediation, distinctly and
                            pointedly. The English and part of the French press are denouncing
                            Salazar. Perhaps this very outrage on the part of the latter is the <pb
                                facs="0055" n="31" xml:id="pg_31"/> most favorable thing which could
                            have happened to Peru; she will have many-friends now, and will not have
                            to rely on our good offices alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Moreira, consul of Peru at Madrid, lately arrived here, has called
                            upon me twice; he has received despatches since the late occurrence from
                            his government, and all the documents and newspapers which treat of the
                            affair; he has been instructed to apply to me for advice and assistance;
                            he is desired to treat with the government here in the absence of a
                            diplomatic representative, and he begged me to propose to the minister
                            on his behalf to be permitted to treat <hi rend="italic">ad
                                referendum.</hi> As this is a somewhat delicate matter, under all
                            and more particularly under present circumstances, I told him I would,
                            in the course of conversation, suggest that idea, but would not bring it
                            forward as a proposition, or insist upon it.</p>
                        <p>In relation to our interposition, and probably also in reference to my
                            conversations with the minister president and the sub-secretary of
                            state, the Epoca, considered the organ of the present government, has an
                            article to-day, which reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The ministers of the crown maintain the most absolute and proper reserve
                            in regard to their determinations in the Peruvian question. It is said,
                            however, in political circles that two of our war frigates have received
                            orders to get ready, and that a lieutenant general (rear-admiral) of our
                            fleet thus increased will take the command.</p>
                        <p>“Peru, it seems, has desired the mediation of the United States in its
                            controversy with Spain, but the last events will naturally prevent the
                            Spanish government from accepting any mediation of a foreign power, as
                            we believe the question will be solved sooner and more favorably by its
                            being treated in a direct manner between Peru and Spain.”</p>
                        <p>The increase of the fleet may have for a principal object the removal of
                            the present commander, Pinzon. There are other articles in the Epoca of
                            to-day which are quite unwarlike, and almost distinctly indicate the
                            disapproval of the acts of Salazar and Pinzon.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Whilst the ministers here were waiting to
                            hear from Mr. Salazar before taking a decided course in the Peruvian
                            difficulties—it being, however, well understood that, unless an entirely
                            different face should be put on the matter by his despatches, his acts
                            and those of the admiral would be disapproved and disavowed—telegraphic
                            despatches have arrived from Southampton last night of a character which
                            may change the aspects of things considerably.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Salazar Ms reached Southampton, and has telegraphed an account of his
                            adventures in leaving Peru and passing through Panama, calculated to
                            create considerable excitement here. I enclose you an article in last
                            night’s Epoca, containing the substance of what he telegraphed. That
                            this account was exaggerated and highly colored, I had not the least
                            doubt the moment I read it.</p>
                        <p>I called upon Mr. Pacheco early this morning. In spite of several efforts
                            I had not been able to see him since his return from Aranjuez, which
                            took place on the 10th instant, and since I had received your despatch
                            No. 95, of 19th May last, marked confidential.</p>

                        <p>He developed these ideas in various ways, leaving, however, the
                            impression upon my mind very firmly that the ministry would use every
                            exertion to avoid hostilities. On day after to-morrow is the regular day
                            for the diplomatic corps to hold interviews with the minister. By that
                            time Mr. Pacheco may be able to indicate to me the course which the
                            ministry propose to take, in view of the new phase of the question.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The surrender of Arguelles has given umbrage to the enemies of General
                            Dulce here. They pretend that General Dulce himself is at the bottom of
                            all those speculations in negroes, and that Arguelles would have made a
                            clean breast of it, and exposed the duplicity of that person.</p>
                        <p>Dulce’s antecedents in the revolution of 1854 are certainly of a
                            character that would lend color to almost any charges of deceitfulness
                            and treachery. But, at the same time, I know too well the disposition of
                            the politicians of this country to pursue one another with unscrupulous
                            and unrelenting fury, as not to be very cautious in believing such
                            accusations as are now launched against General Dulce by his enemies, of
                            which he has a good many.</p>

                            <p>From our special correspondent we receive to-day from England
                                telegraphic despatches, the gravity of which will be understood by
                                the simple relation made to us, and upon which we abstain from any
                                commentary until there be official confirmation of them.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Salazar y Mazarredo landed yesterday at Southampton. With
                                reference to the passengers who came with him, and with reference to
                                himself, it is said, the agnation was extraordinary in Peru and
                                other neighboring republics; in Chili preparations were making for
                                war, to hasten to the aid of the neighbor republic.</p>
                            <p>The diplomatic corps had intervened and proposed a solution, in
                                virtue of which Messrs. Pinzon and Salazar had offered to evacuate
                                the Chincha islands; but although the Peruvian government was
                                favorable, the pressure of the people prevented acceptance, and all
                                negotiation was refused whilst Peruvian territory was occupied by
                                foreign forces.</p>
                            <p>The authorities wished to detain the English packet Talca, which had
                                received Mr. Salazar y Mazarredo on board, who, in view of the
                                dangers hovering around him, had arranged to go to Spain. The
                                commander of the packet defended Mr. Salazar energetically,
                                declaring that if the least violence was done to him, the English
                                forces would take possession of the Peruvian squadron anchored at
                                Callao.</p>
                            <p>Among the passengers on the Talca were, it is said, emissaries
                                charged to assassinate Mr. Salazar. He, however, got safe and sound
                                to Panama, where the populace made a disturbance and broke the
                                windows, and trampled on the flag of the French consul, in whose
                                house Mr. Salazar had sought refuge. On the 21st May he left Panama,
                                incurring great risks, and owing his safety to the English. Mr.
                                Salazar, who landed yesterday at Southampton, and is somewhat out of
                                health, was to-day to have continued his voyage to Spain. He will
                                not reach Madrid till Thursday or Friday.</p>
                            <p>At the latest moment we receive the following despatch from the Havas
                                agency: “Paris, 13th, (at 10 o’clock;) Southampton, 13th.—Mazarredo
                                has reached here in the mail steamer Sena.”</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Peru.</hi>—The foreign ministers in Peru have
                                sought to arrange the difference. Peru refused to treat while
                                Spanish troops occupied its territory. The Peruvian authorities
                                sought to detain the mail steamer Talca, on its way to Panama to
                                catch Mazarredo. The captain of the English war steamer Leander
                                hindered this project, notifying the Peruvian admiral that, in case
                                of such an outrage, he would capture all the Peruvian vessels in the
                                harbor.</p>
                            <p>Among the passengers in the Talca were four Peruvian emissaries, who
                                paid several negroes to assassinate Mr. Salazar y Mazarredo. On
                                reaching Panama, in consequence of the threatening of those negroes,
                                Mazarredo sought refuge in the house of Mr. Nelson; this saved his
                                life, but the consulate general of France was attacked, the windows
                                broken, and the flag trampled on; many other injuries being done in
                                the belief that Mazarredo was within. He left Panama on the 21st,
                                early in the day, followed by a band of assassins to Aspinwall,
                                where his life was safe, thanks to the courage and generosity of the
                                officers of the English Mail Steam Company.</p>

                            from any foreign state.</p>
                        <p>Your latest despatch informs me that on the arrival at Madrid of
                            subsequent instructions from me, and also of news of transactions in
                            Peru, which were unknown at the Spanish capital at the time when our
                            offer was declined, you were making inquiries of Mr. Pacheco, then at
                            Aranjuez, through the undersecretary of state for foreign affairs, to
                            ascertain whether the good offices of this government might not yet be
                            accepted under what you supposed the altered circumstances of the case.
                            I have submitted the papers to the President, and I have the pleasure to
                            inform you that your proceedings are entirely approved.</p>
                        <p>It is now known here, as it is probably understood also at Madrid, that
                            the late commissioner has resigned his trust and gone home; that before
                            resigning, he, together with the Spanish admiral, disowned all designs
                            against the integrity or independence of Peru, and placed the act of
                            seizing the Chincha islands exclusively upon the ground of reprisals for
                            claims, while they expressly allowed the commerce in guano to proceed
                            under conduct of the Peruvian authorities without obstruction.</p>
                        <p>It is also understood here, through a reliable channel, that at a date
                            later than the date of your last advices a belief prevailed at Madrid
                            that the extreme proceedings of the aforementioned commissioner in Peru,
                            when definitely made known at Madrid, would fail to be completely
                            approved by her Catholic Majesty’s government.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances I cannot suppress a hope that the difficulty in
                            question may have already received, or may be now in the way of
                            receiving, a peaceful solution upon principles of equity and justice,
                            and at the same time consistent with the honor of the two nations.</p>
                        <pb facs="0058" n="34" xml:id="pg_34"/>
                        <p>It is not perceived that any new instructions could profitably be given
                            to you concerning the matter. You will govern yourself by the principles
                            already defined, and saving in every case equally the dignity of the
                            United States and respecting the just sensibilities of Spain and Peru,
                            you will do whatever shall seem best calculated to avert war, and
                            restore a good understanding between the two countries. To enable you to
                            proceed with greater circumspection and care, I give you copies of Mr.
                            Robinson’s despatches to me, and of a correspondence of mine with the
                            Peruvian and Spanish ministers concerning the effect of the proceedings
                            at the Chincha islands.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir.</hi>* * * * *</p>
                        <p>Mr. Salazar, owing to sickness, has only arrived here day before
                            yesterday, and on yesterday evening I applied for an interview with Mr.
                            Pacheco, which took place this morning.</p>
                        <p>The minister told me that he had had but one conference with Mr. Salazar;
                            that the latter was preparing a report, to be laid to-day before the
                            council of ministers; that he could, therefore, only speak for himself,
                            but he did not think that his opinion would be much modified by the
                            council. Mr. Salazar having convinced him that an attempt had been made
                            on his life while on his journey, in which, however, he, Mr. Pacheco,
                            did not think the government of Peru implicated, he would be satisfied
                            by a disavowal on the part of that government, and would take its word
                            for it. All his demands upon Peru would be of a nature that could not
                            wound the feelings of that power, and would be made in a spirit anxious
                            to secure peace. He thought he would call on Peru to send a commissioner
                            to explain matters, but he could tell me better in a day or two, when he
                            would put me <hi rend="italic">“au courant”</hi> of what the Spanish
                            government intended to do.</p>
                        <p>I told him that was all that I desired. The moment that Spain would
                            clearly (<hi rend="italic">nettement</hi>) and precisely state what was
                            really demanded of Peru, there was great hope of bringing about a
                            favorable settlement at once. It would be preferable to so reduce to
                            precise terms the claims of Spain, commencing with the Talambo question,
                            at the earliest possible period, before new complications might arise,
                            as I had no doubt, from what he had assured me, that the demands of
                            Spain would be consistent with justice; it would probably take but a
                            very short time for the United States to convince Peru of the propriety
                            of yielding to such demands. That I could undertake to say, from what I
                            had learned from despatches written by the Peruvian government to its
                            consul here, and from what must be apparent from the very nature of
                            things, that no other power in Europe or America was so likely to
                            exercise a strong influence on the government of Peru as my government;
                            and that, perhaps, a simple good advice on its part to Peru could settle
                            the whole difficulty without any trouble and without any formal
                            mediation. He replied, that he was fully aware of that, and that the
                            government of the United States, being a very powerful one, and
                            legitimately the leading one in all America, could certainly bring great
                            influence to bear on this matter. He was very thankful for the interest
                            taken by my government in trying to arrange the difficulties with Peru,
                            and would feel very much obliged <pb facs="0059" n="35" xml:id="pg_35"/>
                            if we would, in a confidential manner, not by way of official mediation,
                            continue to exercise our good offices.</p>
                        <p>I give you barely a rough sketch of the conversation, as time again
                            presses, the mail closing in about an hour, and our interview having
                            ended but a half hour ago.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On yesterday I sent you a despatch (No.
                            104) giving an account of my interview with Mr. Pacheco concerning
                            Peruvian affairs. In the evening Mr. P. was called upon in the senate
                            for explanations, and I now enclose you his speech, from the Official
                            Gazette, hoping that it will reach you the same time as my despatch of
                            yesterday, since I send it direct, and not through our despatch agent at
                            London.</p>
                        <p>The speech has several weak points. It shows clearly that the original
                            cause of all this trouble, the Talambo affair, was really a very
                            insufficient one for any sort of reclamation. The case was pending in
                            the courts, and if it did proceed slowly, it was certainly according to
                            Spanish custom. If Mr. Salcedo, upon whose plantation the row happened,
                            has, by his influence, obstructed the course of justice, (which it may
                            be hard to prove,) he has done no more than what is alleged to take
                            place here almost every day.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor now to give you the
                                information which is found in this department, and the view which is
                                taken of the matter referred to in your note of the 20th June
                                instant.</p>
                            <p>The resolution which was introduced by the honorable Mr. Cox, of
                                Ohio, and <pb facs="0060" n="36" xml:id="pg_36"/> which is referred
                                to in your note, impugns the action of the President of the United
                                States in the recent extradition of a Spanish subject, as a
                                violation of the Constitution of the United States and of the law of
                                nations, and as a proceeding in derogation of that right of asylum
                                which the resolution describes as a “distinguishing feature of our
                                political system.” That this action of the Chief Magistrate of the
                                nation was taken “in the absence of a law or treaty on that
                                subject,” is assigned as the ground or occasion of its being open to
                                these animadversions.</p>
                            <p>The gravity of the subject requires a full and careful examination of
                                the proceeding of the Executive complained of, in its circumstances,
                                its occasion, its motives, and its results, and a thorough inquiry
                                into the precepts of the law of nations and the provisions of the
                                Constitution which that proceeding is alleged to have violated. On
                                the one hand, it never can be a matter of trivial concern to the
                                nation that the conduct of the Chief Magistrate should really be at
                                variance with the law of nations, which must furnish the rule for so
                                large and important a part of the duties of his high office, or with
                                the Constitution, to which he owes that office, and of which he is
                                not only the servant, but also an appointed protector and defender.
                                On the other hand, hasty or careless imputatons of such grave
                                misconduct, if not corrected, tend to impair confidence in the
                                government at home and respect for it abroad.</p>
                            <p>The case presented to the notice of the government of the United
                                States, and upon which the intervention of the Executive was asked
                                by the government of Spain, is set forth in the correspondence
                                communicated to the Senate by the President, in answer to a
                                resolution of that body.</p>
                            <p>In this correspondence it appears that on the 20th of November, 1863,
                                the United States consul general at Havana apprised this government
                                that more than one thousand African negroes had just then been
                                brought to that city; that they had been landed at Cardenas, or
                                Sagua, from a steamship whose name and nationality were unknown, and
                                that very prominent and wealthy persons were implicated in the
                                business, and that the steamer was not captured, but went to Nassau
                                after delivering her cargo.</p>
                            <p>On the 28th of March the Secretary of State communicated this
                                information to the Secretary of the Navy, and also to the British
                                government. Thereupon this government and the British government,
                                proceeding under the provisions of the treaty for the suppression of
                                the African slave trade, united in an urgent appeal to the
                                government of Spain to execute the laws of that country so
                                effectually as to suppress the introduction of African slaves into
                                the island of Cuba. The government of Spain responded to this united
                                appeal in a kind and liberal spirit, and especially approved of the
                                energetic action of the governor general of Cuba in executing the
                                laws.</p>
                            <p>On the 5th of April, 1864, the minister plenipotentiary of Spain
                                addressed a note to the Secretary of State, informing him that José
                                Agustin Arguelles had escaped from the island of Cuba, under the
                                charge of having sold into slavery a large number of recaptured
                                Africans, and taken refuge in New York. The minister stated the
                                circumstances of the case as follows, namely: That Arguelles, then
                                an officer in the Spanish army, was, in November last, lieutenant
                                governor of the district of Colon, and while serving in that
                                capacity effected the seizure of a large expedition of African
                                negroes, (being the same thousand negroes before mentioned; ) that
                                the government of Spain, pleased with his zeal, paid him a large
                                sum, as his share of the prize-money usually allowed to the captors
                                of such expeditions; that he subsequently obtained a leave of
                                absence for twenty days, to proceed to New York, on false pretences,
                                and that after his departure it was discovered that he and other
                                officers of the district of Colon retained and sold into slavery one
                                hundred and forty-one of the negroes which they had recaptured; that
                                the superior court of the island, having exclusive jurisdiction over
                                such cases, had taken cognizance of the case, and then <pb
                                    facs="0061" n="37" xml:id="pg_37"/> required the presence of
                                Arguelles before it, to insure the prompt liberation of the one
                                hundred and forty-one slaves, and that, without such presentation,
                                it would be very difficult, and, at all events, it would require a
                                long time, to attain that object.</p>
                            <p>Her Catholic Majesty’s minister asked that Arguelles might be
                                delivered up to the government of Spain, not upon the ground of a
                                right to demand it, but as an act of comity in the interest of
                                justice and humanity. The culprit, being found at large in the city
                                of New York, was delivered to the Spanish authorities by direction
                                of the President of the United States. Immediately after the arrival
                                of Arguelles at Havana, he was placed in custody for trial,
                                according to the laws of his own country, and eighty-six of the
                                recaptured Africans, whom he had sold into slavery, were restored
                                from bondage to freedom.</p>
                            <p>It will be readily admitted that no application to our government for
                                the discharge of a duty, or the exercise of a right which rested
                                with it under the law of nations, could present more solemn and
                                imposing considerations to engage its attention to an earnest and
                                solicitous inquiry into its obligations and its powers in the
                                premises, that it might faithfully perform the one and exercise the
                                other. That our territory—the refuge of the innocent and
                                oppressed—should not furnish an asylum for the guilty betrayer of
                                human freedom; that our cherished policy for the suppression of the
                                slave trade, to which every department of the
                                government—legislative, judicial, and executive—had been so long and
                                so firmly committed, should meet no check in its purpose, by its law
                                and by its power, to drive from every sea the odious and abominable
                                traffic; that the victims of this atrocious crime should not be left
                                in the misery which our protection of this outlaw from the pursuing
                                justice of his own country must fasten on them—such were the
                                interests of society and of humanity which pressed upon the
                                conscience of the nation, and called for the exercise of every
                                faculty of justice and authority which the law of nations and the
                                Constitution had vested in the Executive.</p>
                            <p>The act required by the exigency of the case was the surrender of the
                                fugitive criminal to the public authority of the country from whose
                                justice he had fled. The practical question for the decision of the
                                President was, whether, in his official capacity, he possessed the
                                authority to make this surrender. That this was the only question
                                cannot be doubted, for no one will gainsay that to possess the
                                requisite authority and to refuse to execute it in the case
                                presented, when the will is free, imports moral complicity in the
                                guilt of the criminal, and cold indifference to the continuing
                                misery of his victims.</p>
                            <p>To determine this question of the authority and duty of the Executive
                                involves the examination of the following considerations:</p>
                            <p>1. Whether by the law of nations the government of the United States
                                in its relations to foreign nations is under the obligation, or
                                possesses the authority, to surrender to the pursuing justice of a
                                foreign state a fugitive criminal found within our territory.</p>
                            <p>2. Whether, in the absence of express treaty stipulations on our part
                                for the surrender of such fugitive criminals, and of any legislation
                                by Congress on the subject, the President of the United States is
                                charged with the obligation, or vested with the authority, to make
                                the surrender, provided such obligation rests upon, or such
                                authority is vested in, the government.</p>
                            <p>3. Whether the occasion presented in the actual case called for the
                                performance of this obligation by the President, if he were charged
                                with it, or for the exercise of this authority, if he possessed
                                it.</p>
                            <p>It will be convenient, if not essential, to consider these
                                propositions in the order in which they are stated, and to observe a
                                just discrimination between them as separate in their nature, and in
                                the topics and authorities which bear upon them. By this method,
                                too, the threefold censure of the resolution before the Committee on
                                the Judiciary will be met, and either justified or refuted.</p>
                            <p>The points of discussion upon which the first proposition turns are
                                few and <pb facs="0062" n="38" xml:id="pg_38"/> simple. Whatever
                                obligations, duties, powers, and relations the law of nations
                                prescribes or attributes to any one nation as towards the other
                                nations of the world, it prescribes and attributes to all nations
                                equally and alike. The internal structure or distribution of the
                                powers and duties of government, that belong to the various forms or
                                constitutions of government which nations adopt for themselves at
                                will, do not in the least affect the measure or the application of
                                the precepts of the law of nations which adjust and govern
                                international rights and obligations. No nation has been more
                                careful to insist upon this equality of nations, whenever we had
                                occasion to claim an international right, or, we may fairly assume,
                                more solicitous to respect it, when a foreign state has asserted an
                                international obligation on the part of our government. But it
                                follows necessarily, from this primary proposition, that the
                                domestic constitutions of government are not in the least degree the
                                source of the <hi rend="italic">international</hi> rights or
                                obligations which nations may justly claim, or must justly submit
                                to. These observations bring us to the same conclusion, that the
                                United States has precisely the same obligations to perform, and
                                possesses the same authority to exercise, towards foreign states, in
                                the extradition of criminals, as all other nations, and that the
                                measure and force of those obligations and of that authority are to
                                be found exclusively in the law of nations, and not in the
                                Constitution or in municipal legislation. It may be superfluous to
                                sustain so obvious a truth by illustration, but our present attitude
                                on this point towards Great Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands,
                                and all other maritime powers of Europe, has been so distinct, and
                                has been so widely understood, and so fully approved by the country,
                                that it is well to understand that it rests upon no other principles
                                than those just laid down. We surrendered Mason and Slidell to Great
                                Britain, we demanded the restoration of the Chesapeake, and we
                                protest against the outfit of the Alabama, the Alexandra, and other

                                the damages which they inflict, upon these principles, and no
                                other.</p>
                            <p>We have said to all the maritime powers that the <hi rend="italic"

                                domestic jurisprudence, furnished the measure of our rights and of
                                their obligations in the matter of naval equipments from their ports
                                to disturb the peace of the seas and prey upon our commerce, and
                                that the resentments and remedies of the <hi rend="italic">law of
                                    nations</hi> were justly open to us if our rights and their
                                obligations were not observed.</p>
                            <p>When we come to look at the authorities, whether institutional or
                                judicial, which lay down the doctrine of the law of nations on the
                                subject of the surrender of fugitive criminals, we shall find the
                                only controverted point to be, whether such extradition is an <hi
                                    rend="italic">absolute obligation</hi> without treaty
                                stipulations concerning it, or is, in the absence of such
                                stipulations, dependent for its exercise upon the circumstances of
                                each case as they shall or shall not seem to the nation, to which
                                the request is made, to furnish a just occasion for its exercise on
                                the principles of justice, humanity, and international comity.</p>
                            <p>It would be out of place to explore and compare, in an extended
                                survey, the text writers or the judicial decisions upon this point;
                                yet it is important that the entire concurrence of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >all</hi> the authorities that the surrender of criminals is a
                                just and proper exercise of national fight, wherever the motives of
                                the particular case are adequate, should be understood; and that it
                                should be also understood that the <hi rend="italic">absolute
                                    obligation</hi> to make such surrender is asserted by a weight
                                of authority equal to that which imposes a qualifying limitation
                                upon it.</p>
                            <p>Wheaton, in his Elements of International Law, says:</p>
                            <p>“The public jurists are divided upon the question, how far a
                                sovereign state is obliged to deliver up persons, whether its own
                                subjects or foreigners, charged with or convicted of crimes
                                committed in another country, upon the demand of a foreign state, or
                                of its officers of justice. Some of these writers maintain the
                                doctrine that according to the law and usage of nations every
                                sovereign state is obliged to refuse an asylum to individuals
                                accused of crimes affecting the general peace and security of
                                society, and whose extradition is demanded <pb facs="0063" n="39"
                                    xml:id="pg_39"/> by the government of that country within whose
                                jurisdiction the crime has been committed. Such is the opinion of
                                Grotius, Heimeccius, Burlamaqui, Vattel, Rutherforth, Schmelzing,
                                and Kent. According to Puffendorf, Voet, Martens, Kluber, Leyser,
                                Kluet, Saalfeld, Schmaltz, Mittermeyer, and Hefter, on the other
                                hand, the extradition of fugitives from justice is a matter of
                                imperfect obligation only, and though it may be habitually practiced
                                by certain states, as the result of mutual comity and convenience,
                                requires to be confirmed and regulated by special compact, in order
                                to give it the force of an international law.” — <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Halleck’s International Law upon the same point says:</p>
                            <p>“The extradition of persons charged with or convicted of criminal
                                offences affecting the general peace and happiness of society is
                                voluntarily practiced by most states, where there are no special
                                compacts, as a matter of general convenience and comity. Some
                                distinguished jurists have treated this question as a matter of
                                strict right, and as constituting a part of the law and usage of
                                nations. Others, equally distinguished, explicitly deny it as a
                                matter of right. The weight of authority is in favor of regarding it
                                as a matter of comity rather than of strict right, under the rules
                                of international law as universally received and established among
                                civilized nations. If it be regarded as a right at all, it is one of
                                those imperfect rights which cannot be enforced, as the obligation
                                on the other party is also imperfect and not universally, even if
                                generally, admitted.”—<hi rend="italic">Halleck’s International

                            <p>Judge Story, in his Conflict of Laws, and in his Commentaries on the
                                Constitution, observes upon the same point as follows:</p>
                            <p>“It has been often made a question, how far any nation is by the law
                                of nations bound to surrender, upon demand, fugitives from justice,
                                who, having committed crimes in another country, have fled thither
                                for shelter. Mr. Chancellor Kent considers it clear upon principle,
                                as well as authority, that every state is bound to deny an asylum to
                                criminals, and, upon application and due examination of the case, to
                                surrender the fugitive to the foreign state where the crime has been
                                committed. Other distinguished judges and jurists have entertained a
                                different opinion.”—<hi rend="italic">Story on the
                                    Constitution,</hi> S. 1808.</p>
                            <p>“There is another point which has been a good deal discussed of late,
                                and that is, whether a nation is bound to surrender up fugitives
                                from justice who escape into its territories and seek there an
                                asylum from punishment. The practice has beyond question prevailed,
                                as a matter of comity, and sometimes of treaty between some
                                neighboring states, and sometimes also between distant states,
                                having much intercourse with each other. Paul Voet remarks, hat
                                under the Roman Empire this right of having a criminal remitted for
                                trial to the proper <hi rend="italic">forum criminis,</hi> was <hi
                                    rend="italic">unquestionable.</hi></p>
                            <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                            <p>“It has, however, been treated by other distinguished jurists as a
                                strict right, and as constituting a part of the law and usage of
                                nations, that offenders charged with a high crime, who have fled
                                from the country in which the crime has been committed, should be
                                delivered up and sent back for trial by the sovereign of the country
                                where they are found. Vattel manifestly contemplated the subject in
                                this latter view, contending that it is the duty of the government,
                                where the criminal is, to deliver him up or to punish him; and if he
                                refuses so to do, then it becomes responsible, as in some measure an
                                accomplice in the crime. This opinion is also maintained with great
                                vigor by Grotius, by Heimeccius, by Burlamaqui, and by Rutherforth.
                                There is no inconsiderable weight of common-law authority on the
                                same side, and Mr. Chancellor Kent has adopted the doctrine in a
                                case which called directly for its decision.”—<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Chancellor Kent, in a judicial decision, where the very point was in
                                judgment, gives an unqualified support to the view that the
                                extradition is <hi rend="italic">obligatory,</hi> in the absence of
                                treaty stipulations, by the law of nations:</p>
                            <p>“It is the law and usage of nations, resting in the plainest
                                principles of justice and public utility, to deliver up offenders
                                charged with felony and other high crimes, and fleeing from the
                                country in which the crime was committed into a foreign and friendly
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>“This doctrine is supported equally by reason and authority.”</p>
                            <p>He quotes the foreign text writers, and the English cases, and finds
                                no authority for Coke’s rejection of the right in the passage so
                                frequently cited from the Institutes.</p>
                            <p>The 27th article of the British treaty, 1795, “was only declaratory

                                in the same treaty.”</p>
                            <p>“These articles were the recognition, not the creation of right, and
                                are equally obligatory upon the two nations, under the sanction of
                                public law, since the expiration of that treaty as they were

                                of the <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi> to surrender foreign
                                criminals. Yet in the following observations he fully maintains <hi

                                the surrender upon motives satisfactory to itself:</p>
                            <p>“The more deeply the subject is considered, the more sensible shall
                                we feel of its difficulties, so that upon the whole the safest
                                principle seems to be that no state has an <hi rend="italic"
                                    >absolute and perfect right to demand</hi> of another the
                                delivery of a fugitive criminal, though it has what is called an <hi
                                    rend="italic">imperfect</hi> right—that is, a right to ask it as
                                a matter of courtesy, good will, and mutual convenience. But a
                                refusal to grant such a request is no just cause of war.</p>
                            <p>“It is certain that this matter of delivering up is an affair of
                                state, in which the judges and inferior magistrates cannot act, but
                                as auxiliary to the executive power. The demand of the foreign court
                                is addressed to none but the Executive; and none other power than
                                the Executive has a right to comply with that demand.</p>
                            <p>“If these principles be just, it follows that under existing
                                circumstances no magistrate in Pennsylvania has a right to cause a
                                person to be arrested in <hi rend="italic">order</hi> to afford an
                                    <hi rend="italic">opportunity</hi> to the President of the
                                United States to deliver him to a foreign government. But what if
                                the Executive should hereafter be of opinion, in the case of some
                                enormous offender, that it had a right, and was bound in duty to
                                surrender him, and should make application to a magistrate for a
                                warrant of arrest? That would be a case quite different from the one
                                before me, and I should think it imprudent at the present moment to
                                give an opinion on it. Every nation has an <hi rend="italic"

                                difference between Chancellor Kent and Chief Justice Tilghman, yet,
                                incidentally, gives the great weight of his authority against the
                                    <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi> of surrender, aside from
                                treaty stipulations, in a reported case. An examination of that
                                case, however, will show that his observations are only upon the
                                point, and to the effect, that the <hi rend="italic">judiciary</hi>
                                cannot by any original authority make the surrender.</p>
                            <p>The prisoner in the case before him had been acquitted, on the ground
                                that the homicide was committed within the jurisdiction of the
                                Society Islands, and not on the high seas. The district judge
                                suggested whether it was not the duty of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >court</hi> to remand the prisoner to the foreign government for
                                trial. Mr. Justice Story said:</p>
                            <p>“That he had never known any such authority exercised by. our <hi
                                    rend="italic">courts,</hi> except where the case was provided
                                for by the stipulations of some treaty. He had great doubts whether,
                                upon principles of international law, and independent of any
                                statutable provisions or treaty stipulations, any <hi rend="italic"
                                    >court of justice</hi> was either bound in duty or authorized in
                                its discretion to send back any offender to a foreign government
                                whose laws he was supposed to have violated.”—2 <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Sumn.,</hi> R., 486.</p>
                            <p>It is manifest from these citations that a violation of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">law of nations</hi> is not predicable of the
                                surrender by one nation to another of a fugitive criminal. Indeed,
                                it might as well be charged that a treaty stipulation between the
                                nations making such surrender of reciprocal obligation was in
                                violation of, and not in obedience to, the law of nations, as that
                                an individual act of extradition of a criminal was such violation.
                                The quality of the act, as at variance or in accord with the law of
                                nations, is not affected by its frequency or by the stipulation in
                                advance for its performance.</p>
                            <p>We may conclude, then, upon the plainest reason and a uniform
                                concurrence of authority, that the United States, in its relations
                                to foreign nations, certainly possesses the authority to surrender
                                to the pursuing justice of a foreign state a fugitive criminal found
                                within our territory.</p>
                            <p>It is not at all important to solve the dispute whether this
                                authority is accompanied or not with an absolute obligation to make
                                the surrender. If the surrender, by the true principles of the law
                                of nations, be indeed obligatory, then <pb facs="0065" n="41"
                                    xml:id="pg_41"/> a refusal or omission to make the surrender
                                would be a violation of that law. If, on the other hand, it be a
                                mere right, and not a complete obligation, the exercise of that
                                right is a pursuance, and not a violation, of the law of nations.
                                Whether a surrender of a criminal, as actually made, was by the
                                proper authority or department of the government making it, is never
                                a question under the law of nations, but wholly under the
                                constitutional or municipal law of that government, distributing
                                powers and duties among its own magistrates and departments.</p>
                            <p>Whether the executive act under consideration is amenable to censure,
                                as not within the competency of the President under the
                                Constitution, is yet to be considered; but, however this may be, the
                                censure of such executive act, as a violation of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">law of nations,</hi> (asserted in the resolution
                                before the Judiciary Committee,) is conceived in error and
                                unsupported by the authority of any publicist or of any
                                adjudication.</p>
                            <p>The second topic of the inquiry is now to engage our attention, and
                                it is well to state how far the preceding views, if correct, have
                                advanced its discussion, and what are the true limits of its further
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>It appears, then, that there rests with the United States, as a
                                nation, either an obligation or an authority to make extraditions,
                                whenever the case presented calls for the exercise of the power.</p>
                            <p>It appears that there is not, and never has been, any treaty
                                stipulations with Spain on the subject of the extradition of
                                criminals. It appears that there is not, and never has been, any
                                national legislation touching the subject of the extradition of
                                criminals, except in connection with treaty stipulations with
                                particular nations; that, consequently, the legislative will has
                                never been expressed as to the mode by which, or the department of
                                the government by which, the actual discharge of the international
                                obligation, if it be such, or exercise of the national authority for
                                the extradition of criminals, is to be performed.</p>
                            <p>In this predicament of the public and municipal law it will at once
                                be seen that there is room for much diversity of opinion as to the
                                legal consequences, as affecting the authority and duty of
                                government, which flow from it. Accordingly, it will be found that
                                in the discussion and action upon the subject which have arisen,
                                upon the exigencies which presented themselves, various theories
                                have divided the assent of the best instructed and most candid
                                minds. These may all be assigned to one or the other of the
                                following views:</p>
                            <p>1. That the extradition of criminals, in cases where the law of
                                nations called for its being made, could not be directed or executed
                                by any department of the federal government for want of an act of
                                Congress in the premises.</p>
                            <p>2. That the several States of the Union might make extradition of
                                criminals to foreign nations, even if the national authority on the
                                subject were set in activity by the treaty-making or legislative
                                power of the federal government, and certainly if these powers
                                remained dormant.</p>
                            <p>3. That the international obligation to surrender criminals was not
                                absolved, nor the national authority to make such surrender
                                paralyzed or suspended, by the omission of Congress to legislate as
                                to the manner and form of effecting the extradition; and that it
                                belongs to the executive of the nation to perform this international
                                obligation, or execute this national authority, by virtue of his
                                office as established by the Constitution of the United States,
                                excluding, on the one hand, the competency of the federal courts to
                                make the surrender as a judicial function, and, on the other, the
                                authority of the separate States of the Union to make it at all.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that no judicial decision of the federal courts upon
                                the direct question of the power or duty of the President of the
                                United States in the premises has ever been made, and that no case
                                has ever presented the point directly for decision. In the case
                                already cited from Johnson’s Reports, Chancellor Kent adjudicated
                                the point in favor of the President’s authority. In the <pb
                                    facs="0066" n="42" xml:id="pg_42"/> case of Holmes, which came
                                before the supreme court of Vermont in banc, the precise point, as a
                                legal question, was decided in favor of the executive authority,
                                that authority having been exercised by the governor of Vermont for
                                the extradition of a Canadian murderer, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >before</hi> the treaty with Great Britain of 1842, and without
                                any legislation of the State on the subject. The supreme court of
                                Pennsylvania, in the case already cited from Sergeant <hi
                                    rend="italic">vs.</hi> Rawle, expressly withheld its opinion
                                upon the point, as not being in judgment before it, and left it for
                                future consideration, when a case should arise, whether the
                                executive of the nation, or of the State, possessed this power,
                                without the support of a treaty or of legislation.</p>
                            <p>In this posture of judicial <hi rend="italic">decisions</hi> upon the
                                point, there are some principal sources of instruction and
                                assistance in arriving at a correct conclusion, which might aid or
                                correct general reasoning and general authorities on the
                                subject:</p>
                            <p>1. The observation of learned judges and their decisions, in cases
                                involving any of the principles, or presenting analogies.</p>
                            <p>2. The practice of the government in its foreign intercourse in
                                questions arising under the law of nations, whether in its own
                                conduct towards foreign nations, or in its demands and expectations
                                from them.</p>
                            <p>Before proceeding to the examination of these sources of information
                                and instruction, it is well to recur to a consideration of the true
                                nature and limits of the determination to be sought, as not being
                                wholly <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                    >judicial,</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">State</hi> and of <hi
                                    rend="italic">administration.</hi></p>
                            <p>Attorney General Wirt, in one of his opinions, to be referred to
                                hereafter more at large, thus clearly presents this important
                                distinction, in reply to questions propounded by the Secretary of
                                State:</p>
                            <p>“The questions which I understand to be propounded for my opinion
                                are:</p>
                            <p>“1st. Whether we are under obligation and have the power to restore
                                the slave? and if so,</p>
                            <p>“2d. What form of proceeding should be adopted for this purpose?</p>
                            <p>“I beg leave to premise that both these questions rest chiefly on
                                national and constitutional law, and on the practice of the
                                government, of which I presume the evidence is to be found in the
                                archives of the state. They are not, therefore, exclusively within
                                the province of this office; but, on the contrary, are questions
                                which address themselves as appropriately to the statesman as the
                                lawyer. I remind you of this truth, that more weight may not be
                                attached to my opinion, under the notion of its being official, than
                                it fairly deserves; and having made this suggestion, I proceed with
                                great respect to express my opinion on the question propounded to
                                me.”</p>
                            <p>The attention of the government to this precise subject of the action
                                of the Executive in the surrender of criminals, and of the rules of
                                the law of nations on the subject, seems first to have arisen upon a
                                demand by Spain for the delivery of one Jones, a criminal who had
                                fled from Florida, a Spanish dominion. Attorney General Lee gives to
                                the Secretary of State, on the 26th January, 1797, this opinion:</p>
                            <p>“If a demand were formally made that William Jones, a subject and
                                fugitive from justice, or any of our own citizens, heinous offenders
                                within the dominion of Spain, should be delivered to their
                                government for trial and punishment, the United States are in duty
                                bound to comply; yet, having omitted to make a law directing the
                                mode of proceeding, I know not how, according to the present system,
                                a delivery of such offender could be effected. To refuse or neglect
                                to comply with such a demand may, under certain circumstances,
                                afford to the foreign nation just cause for war, who may not be

                            <p>It will be observed that this opinion recognizes the complete
                                obligation, though there was no treaty, and the exposure even of the
                                country to war for its non-fulfilment, but finds a complete

                                in the premises. In a word, the Attorney General puts the matter
                                distinctly upon the same considerations as would govern if there
                                were a <hi rend="italic">treaty requiring extradition,</hi> but no
                                law of Congress providing modes and forms for executive action under
                                it. For no one can demand for a treaty stronger obligation or
                                sanction than that “the United States are in duty bound to comply”
                                with it, and that “to refuse or neglect to comply may, under certain
                                circumstances, afford the foreign nation <hi rend="italic">just
                                    cause of war</hi>.”</p>
                            <p>The next occasion upon which the question arose for the action of the
                                government was in the noted case of Thomas Nash, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >alias</hi> Jonathan Bobbins, in the year 1799, claimed under
                                the 27th article of the British treaty. The surrender of the alleged
                                criminal was made by the President, there being no act of Congress
                                as to the mode or agent for the execution of the stipulations of the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>The legal question then of the power of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >President</hi> to make the surrender, which was obligatory upon
                                the nation, was precisely the same as Attorney General Lee had
                                eonceived it; and if his view of the necessity of an act of Congress
                                to invigorate the executive function was sound, the extradition
                                should have been refused to England in 1799, as it had been to Spain
                                in 1797.</p>
                            <p>The action of the Executive in the extradition became the subject of
                                an earnest and most able debate in the House of Representatives,
                                where the arguments on one side and the other were pressed with the
                                utmost skill and force. The celebrated speech of John Marshall,
                                sustaining the action of the President, in its exposition of the
                                doctrines of the law of nations and of the Constitution, which
                                controlled the subject, carried, with Congress and with the country,
                                a judicial weight scarcely surpassed by that awarded to any of his
                                subsequent judgments as Chief Justice.</p>
                            <p>This debate, in its result, may be considered as establishing two
                                propositions: First, that an international obligation, resting upon
                                the government, may be discharged under the Constitution without the
                                aid of an act of Congress. Second, that it was an executive and not
                                a judicial function, to be performed by the President by mere virtue
                                of his office under the Constitution, without the need of any
                                authority from Congress, or of any agency of the courts. It was
                                strenuously contended that the function was in its nature judicial,
                                and must be attributed to the judicial tribunals, and the action of
                                the President was sought to be impugned as wresting the subject from
                                the constitutional control of the judiciary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Marshall thus announced the doctrines on this point, which
                                received the assent of Congress and of the country:</p>
                            <p>“The case was in its nature a national demand made upon the nation.
                                The parties were two nations. They cannot come into court to
                                litigate their claims, nor can a court decide on them. Of
                                consequence, the demand is not a case for judicial cognizance.</p>
                            <p>“The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external
                                relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations. Of
                                consequence, the demand of a foreign nation can only be made on
                                him.</p>
                            <p>“He possesses the whole executive power. He holds and directs the
                                force of the nation. Of consequence, any act to be performed by the
                                force of the nation is to be performed through him.</p>
                            <p>“He is charged to execute the laws. A treaty is declared to be a law.
                                He must then execute a treaty, where he, and he alone, possesses the
                                means of executing it.</p>
                            <p>“The treaty, which is a law, enjoins the performance of a particular
                                object. The person who is to perform this object is marked out by
                                the Constitution, since the person is named who conducts the foreign
                                intercourse, and is to take care that the laws be faithfully
                                executed. The means by which it is be performed, the force of the
                                nation, are in the hands of this person. Ought not this person to
                                perform the object, although the particular mode of using the means
                                has not been prescribed? Congress unquestionably may prescribe the
                                mode, and Congress may devolve on others the whole execution of the
                                contract; but till this be done, it seems the duty of the executive
                                department to execute the contract by any means it possesses.</p>
                            <p>“The executive is not only the constitutional department, but seems
                                to be the proper department to which the power in question may most
                                wisely and most safely be confided.</p>
                            <pb facs="0068" n="44" xml:id="pg_44"/>
                            <p>“The department which is intrusted with the whole foreign intercourse
                                of the nation, with the negotiation of all its treaties, with the
                                power of demanding a reciprocal performance of the article, which is
                                accountable to the nation for the violation of its engagements with
                                foreign nations, and for the consequences resulting from such
                                violation, seems the proper department to be intrusted with the
                                execution of a national contract like that under consideration.</p>
                            <p>“If at any time policy may temper the strict execution of the
                                contract, where may that political discretion be placed so safely as
                                in the department whose duty it is to understand precisely the state
                                of the political intercourse and connexion between the United States
                                and foreign nations, to understand the manner in which the
                                particular stipulation is explained and performed by foreign
                                nations, and to understand completely the state of the Union?”</p>
                            <p>The whole speech of Mr. Marshall, by the method of the closest and
                                most irresistible reasoning, exhibits the conformity of these
                                doctrines with the Constitution, with the principles of
                                international law, and with the established practice of the
                                government, in the maintenance of the international obligation of
                                neutrality, in the surrender by the Executive to one belligerent of
                                prizes taken by the other, in violation or in fraud of our
                                neutrality. This international obligation, though without treaty, he
                                asserted, rested upon the same principles, and was identical in
                                character, with the extradition of criminals. He exposes the error
                                which had described the surrender of prizes in the practice of the
                                government as a judicial proceeding, and exhibits it in its true
                                light as an executive act under the law of nations. A brief
                                quotation from his argument on this point is not out of place, and
                                the whole speech is most worthy of attention. It is found in full in
                                the appendix to 5 Wheat. Rep., in 2 Benton’s Debates, and in
                                Wharton’s State Trials.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Marshall says:</p>
                            <p>“It has been contended that the conduct of the Executive on former
                                occasions, similar to this in principle, has been such as to evince
                                an opinion even in that department that the case in question is
                                proper for the decision of the courts.</p>
                            <p>“The fact adduced to support this argument is the determination of
                                the late President on the case of prizes made within the
                                jurisdiction of the United States, or by privateers fitted out in
                                their ports.</p>
                            <p>“The nation was bound to deliver up those prizes, in like manner as
                                the nation is now bound to deliver up an individual demanded under
                                the twenty-seventh article of the treaty with Britain. The duty was
                                the same and devolved on the same department.</p>
                            <p>“The decision then on the case of vessels captured within the
                                American jurisdiction by privateers fitted out of the American
                                ports, which the gentleman from New York has cited with such merited
                                approbation, and which he has declared to stand upon the same
                                principles with those which ought to have governed the case of
                                Thomas Nash, which deserves the more respect because the government
                                of the United States was then so circumstanced as to assure us that
                                no opinion was lightly taken up and no resolution formed but on
                                mature consideration—this decision, quoted as a precedent and
                                pronounced to be right, is found, on full and fair examination, to
                                be precisely and unequivocally the same with that which was made in
                                the case under consideration. It is a full authority to show that,
                                in the opinion always held by the American government, a case like
                                that of Thomas Nash is a case for executive and not judicial
                                decision.</p>
                            <p>Of the acquiescence of Congress and of the public opinion of the
                                country in the positions of Mr. Marshall, sustained at the time by
                                nearly a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives, the
                                strongest evidence is to be found in the omission of Congress to
                                pass any act during the period that the extradition article of the
                                British treaty of 1795 was in force, and from a similar omission
                                after the negotiation of the treaties of 1842 with Great Britain,
                                and of 1843 with France—each containing an extradition article—until
                                the year 1848, after a judicial doubt thrown upon the point by a
                                difference between the federal judiciary and a justice of the
                                supreme court of New York, arising in the case of Metzger, claimed
                                under the French treaty. In this case of Metzger, arising in the
                                year 1847, the learned judge of the district court of the southern
                                district of New York held that an act of Congress was unnecessary to
                                enable the Executive to carry into effect the extradition article of
                                the treaty with France. A learned justice of the supreme court of
                                New York held otherwise, and that, in the absence of an act of
                                Congress, the federal Executive could not make the extradition. (1
                                Barb. S. C. R., 248.) The case was then brought before <pb
                                    facs="0069" n="45" xml:id="pg_45"/> the Supreme Court of the
                                United States in a petition for <hi rend="italic">habeas
                                    corpus.</hi> The court dismissed the petition on the ground that
                                it had no jurisdiction to issue a <hi rend="italic">habeas
                                    corpus</hi> for the purpose of reviewing the decisions of the
                                United States district judge; but in the opinion of the court,
                                delivered by Mr. Justice McLean, it is declared that the action of
                                the Executive in the case was “proper,” and “the most appropriate,
                                if not the only mode of giving effect to the treaty,” and that the
                                aid of legislation was unnecessary. (5 How. U. S. Rep., 188–9.)</p>
                            <p>It may be considered, therefore, that the political and judicial
                                departments of the government concurred in the opinion, that when
                                there was an obligation, or an authority, resting with the federal
                                government, for the extradition of a criminal, it was to be carried
                                out as an executive and not as a judicial act, and that the aid of
                                Congress was not needed for the competent discharge of the
                                obligation or exercise of the authority.</p>
                            <p>This point being now cleared up, namely, that the absence of an act
                                of Congress does not paralyze the executive function in the
                                discharge of an international duty, or the exercise of an
                                international power, the question reverts to the original one, viz:
                                does the absence of an <hi rend="italic">express treaty</hi>
                                displace the international obligation and the national authority on
                                the subject of the extradition of criminals, in the maintenance of
                                the foreign intercourse of the government?</p>
                            <p>The interval between the expiration of the extradition article of the
                                British treaty of 1795 and the negotiation of the treaty of
                                Washington, in 1842, raised the point for Executive consideration in
                                several cases, and in a case of marked interest and difficulty
                                brought it for judicial observation, though not for express
                                judgment, before the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
                            <p>It was undoubtedly the <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of the federal
                                Executive to decline to make a surrender of a fugitive criminal,
                                during the interval, upon the application of the British government,
                                and in the cases presented to it, which were of ordinary, though
                                sometimes heinous, crime. From this arose another <hi rend="italic"
                                    >habit</hi> of extradition in satisfaction of what was clearly
                                recognized as a necessary measure of justice and humanity, as well
                                as of self-protection—that is to say, an extradition by the State
                                governments upon the direct application of foreign governments. This
                                habit was acquiesced in (and approved in some instances) by the
                                executive department of the federal government.</p>
                            <p>The legislature of New York passed a general law regulating the
                                proceedings for such extraditions by the Executive of the State, and
                                the surrender of criminals, of course without treaty, under the
                                general authority or obligation of the law of nations, and in the
                                notion that this right of sovereignty pertained to the States,
                                became systematic.</p>
                            <p>In this situation of the <hi rend="italic">habits</hi> of the federal
                                and State governments on the subject a notorious case of crime
                                occurred in the Netherlands, in the robbery of the jewels of the
                                Princess of Orange. The diplomatic representative of that government
                                applied to the government of the United States for the extradition
                                of the criminal, who was found in the city of New York. Attorney
                                General Taney gave to Mr. Livingston, then Secretary of State, an
                                opinion as to the propriety of the surrender by the federal
                                Executive in these terms: “As there is no stipulation by treaty
                                between the two governments for the mutual delivery of fugitives
                                from justice, I think the President would not be justified in
                                directing the surrender of the person upon whom a part of the stolen
                                articles may have been found, in order that he may be brought to
                                trial in the country where he is supposed to have committed the
                                robbery.” (Opinions of Attorneys General, vol. 2, p. 452.) Mr.
                                Livingston, in communicating the decision of the President,
                                expresses to the minister of the Netherlands his hopes “that, from
                                the authorities of the State of New York having taken cognizance of
                                the matter, the objects in view may be obtained by the means now
                                pursuing, as effectually and more constitutionally than they could
                                have been by a literal compliance with the request which has been
                                made.” The Department of State sent the <pb facs="0070" n="46"
                                    xml:id="pg_46"/> correspondence with the minister of the
                                Netherlands, at his request, to the governor of the State of New
                                York, and that magistrate (Governor Throop) issued his executive
                                warrant for the delivery of the criminal to the minister of the
                                Netherlands, “to the end that he may he placed under the
                                jurisdiction of the said kingdom of the Netherlands, to be dealt
                                with for his supposed crime, according to the laws and justice of
                                the said kingdom.”</p>
                            <p>In the State of Vermont a like <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of
                                extradition had sprung up, and there the governor, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >without any law of the State on the subject,</hi> and, of
                                course, without treaty, as a direct exercise of authority under the
                                law of nations, and not forbidden to the States by the federal
                                Constitution, made the extradition by his executive warrant. Upon
                                    <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> sued out by the criminal,
                                upon solemn argument the supreme court of Vermont, in full bench,
                                held the extradition to be in pursuance of the law of nations, to be
                                valid without legislation, and to be competent to the State under
                                the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of the State
                                court was brought up for review to the Supreme Court of the United
                                States, and the opinion of the learned justices of that court will,
                                by a little attention to the true point in controversy, be seen to
                                bear upon the point we are now considering, viz., whether a treaty
                                is the source, under the Constitution of the United States, of the
                                executive authority to surrender criminals, or whether the law of
                                nations supplies that authority to the nation, and the Constitution
                                itself confers the exercise of it upon the President.</p>
                            <p>The point in judgment in Holmes <hi rend="italic">vs.</hi> Jennison
                                (14 Pet. Rep., 649) was whether the States had authority to
                                surrender criminals <hi rend="italic">when the United States had
                                    made no treaty and no law upon the subject.</hi> It was conceded
                                on all hands that this authority belonged to sovereignty, and that
                                its exercise remained with the States unless, at the time of such
                                exercise, it rested with the United States <hi rend="italic">under
                                    the Constitution, and</hi> unless its concurrent exercise by the
                                States was incompatible with its <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>
                                by the federal government. It was apparent, therefore, that if a
                                treaty was necessary to put the federal government in possession of
                                this authority, there being no such treaty, the action of the State
                                of Vermont was within its competency; but if the federal government
                                was in possession of this authority <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a
                                    <hi rend="italic">treaty,</hi> then the action of the State was
                                beyond its competency, unless a concurrent authority was
                                admissible.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, Mr. Justice Thompson with his usual discrimination makes
                                    <hi rend="italic">the turning point of the jurisdiction of the
                                    court</hi> to be, whether this power of surrendering criminals
                                was in the government of the United States <hi rend="italic">by the
                                    Constitution,</hi> or whether it needed to have its being and
                                origin in a treaty. He rejected the jurisdiction for the reason that
                                he held a treaty necessary to <hi rend="italic">confer</hi> the
                                power on the government. He observes:</p>
                            <p>“There is certainly no specific provision in the Constitution on the
                                subject of surrendering fugitives from justice from a foreign
                                country, if demanded, and we are left at large to conjecture upon
                                various parts of the Constitution, to see if we can find that such
                                power is, by fair and necessary implication, embraced within the
                                Constitution. I mean, whether any such obligation is imposed upon
                                any department of our government by the Constitution to surrender to
                                a foreign government a fugitive from justice; for unless there is
                                such a power vested somewhere, it is difficult to perceive how the
                                governor of Vermont has violated any authority given by the
                                Constitution to the general government. If such a power or
                                obligation in the absence of any treaty or law of Congress on the
                                subject rests anywhere, I should not be disposed to question its
                                being vested in the President of the United States. It is a power
                                essentially national in its character, and required to be carried
                                into execution by intercourse with a foreign government, and there
                                is a fitness and propriety of this being done through the executive
                                department of the government, which is intrusted with authority to
                                carry on our foreign intercourse.</p>
                            <p>“And unless the President of the United States is, under the
                                Constitution, vested with such power, it exists nowhere, there being
                                no treaty or law on the subject. And it appears to me indispensably
                                necessary, in order to maintain the jurisdiction of this court in
                                the present case, to show that the President is vested with such
                                power under the Constitution.”</p>
                            <p>“The Secretary of State, in answer to the letter of the governor of
                                Vermont on the subject, says:</p>
                            <pb facs="0071" n="47" xml:id="pg_47"/>
                            <p>“I am instructed by the President to express his regret to your
                                excellency that the request of the acting governor of Canada cannot
                                be complied with under any authority now vested in the executive
                                government of the United States, the stipulation between this and
                                the British government for the mutual delivery over of fugitives
                                from justice being no longer in force, and the renewal of it by
                                treaty being at this time a subject of negotiation between the two
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>“Here, then, is a direct denial by the President of the existence of
                                such a power in the executive, in the absence of any treaty on the
                                subject; and such has been the settled and uniform course of the
                                executive government of the United States upon this subject since
                                the expiration of our treaty with England. And if this be so, it may
                                be emphatically asked what power in the general government comes in
                                conflict with the power exercised by the governor of Vermont? In
                                order to maintain the jurisdiction of this court in the present
                                case, it must be assumed that the President has under and by virtue
                                of the Constitution, in the absence of any treaty on the subject,
                                authority to surrender fugitives from justice to a foreign
                                government; otherwise it cannot be said that the governor of Vermont
                                has violated the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                            <p>“This power to surrender fugitives from justice to a foreign
                                government has its foundation, its very life and being, in a treaty
                                to be made between the United States and such foreign government,
                                and is not by the Constitution vested in any department of our
                                government without a treaty.”</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, Chief Justice Taney, and Justices Story, McLean,
                                and Wayne, sustained the jurisdiction, the Chief Justice delivering
                                an elaborate opinion. A few citations from this opinion will show
                                that these four learned justices took the opposite view to Judge
                                Thompson’s, and construed the Constitution itself as lodging the
                                power in the federal government, antecedent to and independent of
                                treaty stipulations.</p>
                            <p>Chief Justice Taney says:</p>
                            <p>“This case presents a question of great importance, upon which
                                eminent jurists have differed in opinion. Can a State, since the
                                adoption of the Constitution of the United States, deliver up an
                                individual found within its territory to a foreign government, to be
                                there tried for offences alleged to have been committed against it?
                                This involves an inquiry into the relative powers of the federal and
                                State governments upon a subject which is sometimes one of great
                                delicacy.</p>
                            <p>“The power which has been exercised by the State of Vermont is a part
                                of the foreign intercourse of this country, and has undoubtedly been
                                conferred on the federal government.</p>
                            <p>“As the rights and duties of nations towards one another in relation
                                to fugitives from justice are a part of the law of nations and have
                                always been treated as such by the writers upon public law, it
                                follows that the treaty-making power must have authority to decide
                                how far the right of a foreign nation in this respect will be
                                recognized and enforced when it demands the surrender of any one
                                charged with offences against it. Indeed, the whole frame of the
                                Constitution supports this construction. All the powers which relate
                                to our foreign intercourse are confided to the general government.
                                The power of deciding whether a fugitive from a foreign nation
                                should or should not be surrendered was necessarily a part of the
                                powers thus granted.”</p>
                            <p>The writ of error was dismissed on an equal division of the court,
                                some special grounds of dissent from the opinion of Chief Justice
                                Taney being taken by the other associate justices. But it was so
                                apparent that, on the merits, a majority of the court were with the
                                Chief Justice, that upon a new hearing in the supreme court of
                                Vermont the prisoner was discharged, on the ground that it was
                                contrary to the Constitution of the United States for a State to
                                make extradition of criminals.</p>
                            <p>In the case of Kaine, whose extradition had been claimed under the
                                British treaty by a direct application to a judicial officer of the
                                United States, the question was brought up for review, and the point
                                was taken that the application must be made by the foreign
                                government to the Executive of the United States, and that the
                                auxiliary judicial inquiry of fact must be made upon his
                                institution. The case was dismissed upon the concurrence of a
                                majority of the court on a question of jurisdiction. In the opinion
                                of Mr. Justice Nelson, in which Chief Justice Taney and Mr. Justice
                                Daniel concurred, the character of extradition, as an executive and
                                not a judicial function, is thus stated:</p>
                            <p>“It may, I think, be assumed at this day, as an undoubted principle
                                of this government, that its judicial tribunals possess no power to
                                arrest and surrender to a foreign country fugitives from justice,
                                except as authorized by treaty stipulations and acts of Congress
                                passed in <pb facs="0072" n="48" xml:id="pg_48"/> pursuance thereof.
                                Whether Congress could confer the power independently of a treaty is
                                a question not necessarily involved in this case and need not be
                                examined. If it was, as at present advised, I am free to say that I
                                have found no such power in any article or clause of the
                                Constitution delegated to that body by the people of the State.</p>
                            <p>“When the <hi rend="italic">casus fæderis</hi> occurs, the
                                requisition or demand must be made by the one nation upon the other;
                                and, upon our system of government, a demand made upon the nation
                                must be made upon the President, who has charge of all its foreign
                                relations, and with whom only foreign governments are authorized or
                                even permitted to hold any communication of a national concern. He
                                alone is authorized by the Constitution to negotiate with foreign
                                governments and enter into treaty obligations binding upon the
                                nation; and in respect to all questions arising out of these
                                obligations, or relating to our foreign relations, in which other
                                governments are interested, application must be made to him. A
                                requisition or demand, therefore, upon this government must, under
                                any treaty stipulation, be made upon the Executive, and cannot be
                                made through any other department or in any other way.”</p>
                            <p>And the learned justice then quoted, with approval, certain
                                propositions of Mr. Marshall on this point, above given from his
                                speech in the case of Thomas Nash.</p>
                            <p>Upon a survey of all these cases before the federal and State
                                judiciaries, in much diversity and no inconsiderable contrariety of
                                theory and reasoning, it may confidently be asserted that the weight
                                of authority holds—</p>
                            <p>First. That the function of extradition is executive and not
                                judicial.</p>
                            <p>Second. That it pertains to the federal and not to the State
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>Third. That it is conferred on the federal government by the
                                Constitution itself, and exists antecedent to and independent of
                                treaties.</p>
                            <p>Fourth. That it is attributed to and may be exercised by the
                                Executive without the need of legislative aid.</p>
                            <p>Upon the primary question whether, by the law of nations, extradition
                                of fugitive criminals is absolutely obligatory, or only
                                discretionary, upon considerations of justice, humanity and comity,
                                it may be stated that the latter seems to be the view more generally
                                accepted in the federal jurisprudence, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >obligation</hi> being considered as imposed only by treaty
                                stipulations to that effect. This view was held by Attorney General
                                Wirt, and the expediency of exercising this discretionary power by
                                the Executive, in proper cases, was recognized by him. In giving
                                these views in a case presented by the Executive for his official
                                advice, he accompanies them with the suggestion that the aid of
                                legislation is necessary, and should be given. An examination of Mr.
                                Wirt’s opinion given to the government on the subject of the
                                surrender of <hi rend="italic">property</hi> by the Executive, on
                                requisition, (which Mr. Marshall, as we have seen, demonstrated to
                                be identical in principle with the extradition of criminals,) will,
                                we think, forcibly expose his error in this view of the need of
                                legislative aid to invigorate the executive authority.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wirt says, in an opinion under date of November 20, 1821:</p>
                            <p>“The truth seems to be that this duty to deliver up criminals is so
                                vague and uncertain as to the offences on which it rests, is of so
                                imperfect a nature, as an obligation, is so inconveniently
                                encumbered in practice by the requisition that the party demanded
                                shall have been convicted on full and judicial proof, or such proof
                                as may be called for by the nation on whom the demand is made, and
                                the usage to deliver or to refuse, being perfectly at the option of
                                each nation, has been so various and consequently so uncertain in
                                its action, that these causes combined have led to the practice of
                                providing by treaty for <hi rend="italic">all cases</hi> in which a
                                nation wishes to give herself the right to call for fugitives from
                                her justice.</p>
                            <p>“I am further of the opinion that even if, by the laws and usages of
                                nations, the obligation existed, and were a perfect obligation, and
                                the proof which is offered of the guilt of the accused also
                                satisfied the requisitions of that law, still the President has no
                                power to make the delivery. The Constitution, and the treaties and
                                acts of Congress made under its authority, comprise the whole of the
                                President’s power. Neither of these contains any provision on the
                                subject. He has no power to arrest any one, except for the violation
                                of our own laws. A treaty or an act of Congress might clothe him
                                with the power to arrest and deliver up fugitive criminals from
                                abroad, and it is, perhaps, to be desired that such a power existed,
                                to be exercised or not, at his discretion, for although not <hi
                                    rend="italic">bound</hi> to deliver up such persons, it might
                                very often be expedient to do it. There could certainly be no
                                objection to the exercise of such power in a case like the present.
                                It would violate no claim which these fugitives have on us. Humanity
                                requires us to afford an asylum to the unfortunate, <pb facs="0073"
                                    n="49" xml:id="pg_49"/> but not to furnish a place of refuge to
                                the guilty. On the other hand, respect for ourselves, and a prudent
                                regard for the purity of our society, admonish us to repel rather
                                than to invite the admixture of foreign turpitude and
                                contamination.</p>
                            <p>“There is another consideration connected with this subject which I
                                beg leave to bring to your view. The people of the United States
                                seem to have contemplated the national government as the sole and
                                exclusive organ of intercourse with foreign nations. It ought,
                                therefore, to be armed with power to satisfy all fair and proper
                                demands which foreign nations may make on our justice and courtesy,
                                or, in other words, with power to reciprocate with foreign nations
                                the fulfilment of all the moral obligations, perfect and imperfect,
                                which the law of nations devolves upon us as a nation. In this
                                respect our system appears to me crippled and imperfect. It might be
                                set to rights, with regard to the subject under consideration, by an
                                act of Congress providing for the punishment of our own citizens
                                who, having committed offences abroad, come home for refuge, and for
                                the delivery of foreign culprits who flee to us fer shelter”.—<hi

                            <p>Attorney General Legare, in an opinion given October 11, 1841, puts
                                the matter of declining the extradition wholly on the practice of
                                the government:</p>

                                gives his views on the general subject, in disposing of an
                                application to this government to demand the extradition of a
                                criminal, fled to the British provinces, charged with a crime not
                                enumerated in our treaty with Great Britain. Mr. Gushing says:</p>
                            <p>“I have examined the papers which you were pleased to submit to me in
                                the case of the people of New York <hi rend="italic">vs.</hi> Aaron
                                Wing, from which it appears that said Wing is under indictment for
                                larceny, alleged to have been committed by him in violation of the
                                laws of the State of New York, and is now a fugitive from justice in
                                the British provinces, and application is made to you for process to
                                obtain the extradition of said Wing.</p>
                            <p>“Larceny is not among the cases provided for by any convention
                                between the United States and Great Britain. The crimes enumerated
                                in the treaty of 1842, which now governs the question, are murder,
                                or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or
                                robbery, or forgery in the utterance of forged papers. It is,
                                therefore, in these cases only that by treaty either government <hi

                            <p>It is believed that these opinions of successive Attorneys General
                                indicate the views, from time to time, on which the practice of the
                                government of the United States has been to decline the extradition
                                of <hi rend="italic">criminals</hi> in such cases as have arisen, in
                                the absence of treaty stipulations. The theory upon which this
                                practice has from time to time been rested, has not always been
                                fully indicated in the opinions given by these learned officers, but
                                unquestionably it has had its origin in the error, as it is
                                confidently submitted later judicial discussions have shown it to
                                be, that treaties <hi rend="italic">conferred</hi> the power on the
                                government, and legislation must attribute the function to the
                                Executive; whereas the very existence of the government, as that of
                                a nation among nations, devolved this <pb facs="0074" n="50"
                                    xml:id="pg_50"/> power and responsibility upon the government,
                                and the Constitution itself attributed this executive function, with
                                all others, to the President.</p>
                            <p>It has already been suggested that the practice of the government
                                upon a branch of international relations whose just conduct, under
                                the law of nations and the Constitution of the United States, rests
                                upon the same principles which must govern this subject of
                                extradition, has uniformly recognized the duty and ability of the
                                government, in its executive department, to represent and act for
                                the nation, without deriving power from treaties or from
                                Congress.</p>
                            <p>Under the administration of Washington the whole subject of the
                                powers and duties of the government, under the law of nations, and
                                of the assignment of these powers and duties to the executive
                                department, was settled upon the surest foundations of principle.
                                And the practice of the government has never departed from the rules
                                then established.</p>
                            <p>An adherance to these rules, upon all occasions, when the nation, as
                                a neutral, has been called upon to fulfil obligations to
                                belligerents, has preserved us from being drawn into hostilities,
                                and made our conduct an illustrious example and guide for the great
                                powers of the civilized world. Under the present administration the
                                Executive has adhered to the same principles in the relations which
                                the civil war has induced between this government and the maritime
                                powers of Europe. To these principles the Executive has looked for
                                the measure of the obligations of one nation to another, under the
                                law of nations, and for the measure and support of the executive
                                authority in the premises without the presence of treaty
                                stipulations or of the legislation of Congress, The course of
                                discussion, diplomatic and popular, has brought so distinctly and so
                                recently before the public mind the historical illustrations of the
                                conduct of our government, and the action of the present
                                administration is so freshly in the public attention, that it is
                                unnecessary to insist upon the transactions in detail. It is
                                sufficient to say that the proposition of Mr. Marshall, assented to
                                by his great opponents in debate, that the executive function of the
                                extradition of criminals, under the law of nations and the
                                Constitution of the United States, “is precisely and unequivocally
                                the same” as that of the surrender of prizes, has never been
                                refuted, and is believed to be impregnable.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Wirt, in his office of Attorney General, was called upon to
                                advise the Executive as to its duty in certain cases where surrender
                                was claimed from the government by foreign nations. In two of these
                                cases the subject of the surrender claimed was <hi rend="italic"
                                    >slaves</hi>—a subject, under the general law of nations,
                                falling more properly under the head of extradition of persons, than
                                of delivery of property. In neither of these cases, besides, were
                                the slaves charged as <hi rend="italic">criminals,</hi> so that
                                their case fell within the privilege of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >asylum,</hi> which civilized nations, and this nation more than
                                all others, so strenuously and so resolutely maintain in protection
                                of all refugees from political prosecution or personal
                                oppression.</p>
                            <p>I proceed to quote from Mr. Wirt’s opinions. Under date of November
                                7, 1821, the Attorney General, in the case of a vessel under
                                consideration, upholds the executive power, and insists upon the
                                international duty to make the surrender, even to the point of
                                arresting private judicial proceedings against the vessel.</p>
                            <p>“If the President of the United States is satisfied that the seizure
                                of La Jeune Eugenie by the United States schooner Alligator,
                                Lieutenant C. Stockton commander, was a violation of the sovereignty
                                of the King of France, and that she ought to be restored on the
                                demand of the French minister, I can perceive no impropriety in
                                adopting the course which was pursued in the case of the Exchange,
                                and approved by the Supreme Court, (7th Cranch, 116,) that is, to
                                disclose this fact to the court, before which the case is depending,
                                by a suggestion to be filed by the attorney for the United States.
                                It was the course which was pursued by President Washington in 1796,
                                with regard to the Cassius, an armed vessel bearing the commission
                                of the French republic.”—(2 <hi rend="italic">Dallas,</hi> 365.)</p>

                                appears to me that it would be a palpable dereliction of duty on the
                                part of the Executive to withhold the communication of this opinion

                            <p>Again, under date of January 22, 1822, Mr. Wirt advises the surrender
                                to the French government of certain Africans:</p>
                            <p>“I have again considered the request of the French minister that the
                                Africans found on board the French brig La Pensee, on her recapture
                                from the pirates, should be delivered to him, as having been found
                                on board of a French vessel, he proposing to restore them to their
                                native land, from which they have been unlawfully taken; and it
                                appears to me entirely proper to accede to his request.</p>
                            <p>“The Africans in question are not in the predicament in which our
                                statutes prescribe the duty of the President; there has been no
                                intention to violate our laws; they were not on their way to this
                                country when captured by the pirates, nor when recaptured from them.
                                They are not, therefore, within the provisions of any of our
                                statutes.</p>
                            <p>“It has been doubted whether you have any power to act on the
                                subject; but it was determined in the case of the Jeune Eugenie that
                                we had no right to meddle with the flag of France, and that when a
                                vessel covered by that flag had been turned from her course by one
                                of our cruisers the President had power to restore her, or to hand
                                her over, on application of the minister of France, to the French
                                consul. It is, in my opinion, for the exercise of the same power
                                only that the French minister has called here.”— <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Opinions of Attorneys General,</hi> vol. 1, pp. 534, 535.</p>
                            <p>In the year 1822 the minister of Denmark demanded the extradition of
                                a slave who had hid himself on board an American vessel when in a
                                port of the Danish island of St. Croix. The presence of the fugitive
                                on board had not been discovered till the vessel was well on its
                                voyage, and he was brought to New York; The views of Mr. Wirt on the
                                public and constitutional questions presented to him are remarkably
                                clear and thorough. That so lamentable and perverse a misapplication
                                of them should be made, must be ascribed to the then policy and
                                principles of our government on the subject of slavery. Under date
                                of September 27, 1822, Mr. Wirt says:</p>
                            <p>“From these views I am of the opinion that it is due to the
                                sovereignty of Denmark, and to our own character as a nation, to
                                restore this slave to the condition from which he has been taken, by
                                a ship carrying our flag, and belonging to our citizens, and that
                                the policy of our own laws conspires to enforce the performance of
                                this duty.</p>
                            <p>“With regard to the President’s power to order the restitution, I
                                consider the question as settled long since by the practice of the
                                government, sanctioned by the acquiescence of the people. The point
                                once conceded that Denmark alone has the right to pronounce upon the
                                condition of this man, that she has pronounced him a slave, and the
                                property of a Danish subject, I see no difference between the
                                President’s authority to restore a ship or any other property
                                belonging to a subject of a foreign power, which has been improperly
                                taken from his possession by our citizens, or by a force furnished
                                from the United States. This question, as regards ships, was very
                                solemnly and on great deliberation settled by President Washington,
                                assisted by the officers of the government who formed his first
                                council in 1793, and the existence of the power was unanimously
                                affirmed. The same power has been since repeatedly exercised on
                                various occasions, and in different forms. Even where proceedings
                                have been instituted against the subject in a court of admiralty,
                                and the President has been required by the government to which or to
                                whose people the property belongs to cause it to be restored, the
                                President has, by a mere suggestion, filed in court by the attorney
                                of the United States acting avowedly under his authority, arrested
                                the proceedings of the court, and thus effected a restoration of the
                                property, of which the following instances occur: The cases of the
                                Cassius, in 1796; the Young Eugenie, in 1821. In all these cases the
                                restoration was the mere effect of the interference of the
                                President, and I can perceive no sound distinction in principle
                                between these cases and the case under consideration.</p>
                            <p>“After so long an acquiescence in the exercise of this power on the
                                part of the President it would seem unnecessary to investigate the
                                source from whence he derived it. But I understand the process of
                                reasoning which has led to the exercise of this power to be this:
                                The President is the executive officer of the laws of the country;
                                these laws are not merely the Constitution, statutes, and treaties
                                of the United States, but those general laws of nations which govern
                                the intercourse between the United States and foreign nations, which
                                impose on them, in common with other nations, the strict observance
                                of a respect for their national rights and sovereignties, and thus
                                tend to preserve their peace and harmony. The United States in
                                taking the rank of a nation must take with it the obligation to
                                respect the rights of <pb facs="0076" n="52" xml:id="pg_52"/> other
                                nations. This obligation becomes one of the laws of the country; to
                                the enforcement of which the President, charged by his office with
                                the execution of all our laws, and charged in a particular manner
                                with the superintendence of our intercourse with foreign nations, is
                                bound to look, and where wrong has been done to a foreign
                                government, (invasive of its sovereignty and menacing to our own
                                peace,) to rectify the injury so far as it can be done by a
                                disavowal and the restoration of things to the <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>“In the particular case before us the performance of this duty would
                                find sanction in the spirit and policy of our statutes prohibitory
                                of the introduction of people of color among us, in relation to
                                which so large a power is given to the President by the second
                                section of the act of the 3d of March, 1819, in addition to the acts
                                prohibiting the slave trade.</p>
                            <p>“II. What form of proceeding should be adopted for this purpose?</p>
                            <p>“I presume that the President might, by an order directed to the
                                marshal of the State of New York, require him to deliver this slave
                                to the order of the minister of Denmark. But as I understand that
                                the civil authorities of New York have taken possession of this
                                slave for the purpose of guarding the State against the danger of
                                being burdened with the expenses of his maintenance, I submit to
                                you, sir, whether it may not be due to comity to make the case known
                                to the governor of the State, and to request that he will cause the
                                slave to be delivered to the marshal for the purpose aforesaid,
                                giving to the marshal the necessary corresponding instructions.”—<hi

                            <p>In closing this examination of the principles of the Constitution,
                                and of the practice of the government touching the extradition of
                                criminals, (in the absence of treaty stipulations, or of an act of
                                Congress to control,) it would seem to be demonstrated that, however
                                reasonable and expedient, in the particular cases in which the
                                extradition was declined, the action of the Executive may have been,
                                (a topic not pertinent to the present inquiry,) an extradition in
                                these cases could not have been pronounced a violation of the
                                Constitution of the United States. It would have been but an
                                exercise of discretionary authority, under the law of nations,
                                vested by the Constitution in the President. In any one of these
                                cases an extradition might have been open to condemnation, as
                                unsuitable and oppressive, if its circumstances had given it that
                                character, but it could not be condemned as a usurpation of power
                                and a violation of the Constitution. So in the case now under
                                consideration. Though the particular exercise of this authority of
                                extradition may be at variance with principles of justice and
                                humanity, if such a pretence can be made, yet <hi rend="italic"
                                    >that</hi> inculpation of the Executive would not involve a
                                usurpation of power or a violation of the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>A few words should be devoted to that phrase of the resolution which
                                charges the action of the Executive to have been “in derogation of
                                the right of asylum.” That the practice of civilized nations, and
                                especially of this country, has maintained this privilege of asylum,
                                and that this nation at least would consider its honor engaged to
                                vindicate it, no one will be disposed to deny. This privilege is
                                understood to embrace refugees from personal oppression and from the
                                consequences of political offences. But no civilized nation, and our
                                own as little as any, has included within this privilege criminals
                                guilty of crimes proscribed by nature and humanity. In these cases,
                                to afford protection against pursuing justice is an offence against
                                humanity and against our own society. Mr. Wirt, in a passage already
                                quoted, draws the distinction with force and precision. In speaking
                                of the case of the criminals before him, he says their surrender
                                “would violate no claim which these fugitives have on us. Humanity
                                requires us to afford an asylum to the unfortunate, but not to
                                furnish a place of refuge to the guilty. On the other hand, respect
                                for ourselves and a prudent regard for the purity of our society
                                admonish us to repel rather than invite the admixture of foreign
                                turpitude and contamination.”</p>
                            <p>Attorney General Gushing has presented the matter with admirable
                                clearness in an opinion under date of October 4, 1853. The head note
                                of his opinion is as follows:</p>
                            <p>“The mutual extradition of fugitives from justice is an object alike
                                interesting to all governments.</p>
                            <p>“Emigrants and exiles, for cause of political difference at home, are
                                entitled to asylum in this country, but not malefactors. On the
                                contrary, the foreign government which reclaims its fugitive
                                malefactors is serviceable to us by ridding us of the intrusive
                                presence of crime.</p>
                            <pb facs="0077" n="53" xml:id="pg_53"/>
                            <p>Hence, when reclamation of a fugitive from justice is made, under
                                treaty stipulation, by any foreign government, it is the duty of the
                                United States to aid in relieving the case of any technical
                                difficulties which may he interposed to defeat the ends of public
                                justice, the object to be accomplished being alike interesting to
                                both governments, namely, the punishment of malefactors, who are the
                                common enemies of all society.”</p>
                            <p>In closing the opinion, Mr. Cushing says:</p>
                            <p>“The object to be accomplished in all these cases is alike
                                interesting to each government, namely, the punishment of
                                malefactors, the common enemies of every society. While the United
                                States afford an asylum to all whom political differences at home
                                have driven abroad, it repels malefactors, and is grateful to their
                                governments for undertaking their pursuit and relieving us from
                                their intrusive presence.”— <hi rend="italic">Opinions of Attorneys

                            <p>It seems to be well settled now, in the jurisprudence of the United
                                States, that the several States have the right to exclude by
                                legislation, and through executive power, criminals, paupers,
                                vagrants, and other injurious elements of society, under the powers
                                reserved to the States under the frame of our government.—(State of

                            <p>An instance of the exercise of this light of exclusion of criminals
                                by a State, upon motives of self-protection against the burden and
                                pollution of their presence, occurred in 1855, when Mr. Marcy was
                                Secretary of State, and Mr. Wood was mayor of New York. By the
                                correspondence on file in the Department of State it appears that,
                                upon information communicated to the department by the consul at
                                Hamburg, and imparted to the mayor of New York, that magistrate
                                arrested and sent out of the country the alleged criminals. As
                                illustrative of the general subject, this correspondence is
                                annexed.</p>
                            <p>It is, then, a misconception to speak of the extradition of a <hi
                                    rend="italic">criminal,</hi> not within the description of a
                                political refugee, as “in derogation of the right of asylum.”</p>
                            <p>We are brought, now, by the course of this inquiry to the only
                                remaining question which the nature of the subject, or the method
                                adopted for its treatment, has left for consideration. We have seen
                                the true position of the national obligation and authority for the
                                extradition of criminals, as defined and established by the law of
                                nations. We have seen that this obligation and authority, under the
                                Constitution of the United States, and in the absence of treaty
                                stipulations and statutory enactments, rest with the President. We
                                have only further to consider whether the occasion presented, in the
                                actual case, properly called for the performance, by the President,
                                of this national obligation, and the exercise of this national
                                authority.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that, in the very nature of such an application made to
                                our government by a friendly power, there is no opportunity for the
                                suggestion of any motives or interests of a private or personal
                                character, as possibly inviting or shaping the action of the
                                Executive. The question presented to him has no connexion with
                                topics or considerations except of the most public, the most
                                important, and the most elevated character. Nor can there be any
                                hesitation in feeling that, upon such an application, all purely
                                official considerations would prompt the Executive to decline,
                                rather than assume, affirmative and responsible action, when such a
                                disposition of the matter might find a ready justification, and an
                                opposite course might invite criticism or incur censure. In judging,
                                therefore, whether the case presented to the President was suitable
                                for the exercise of his authority, we may feel sure that the plain
                                and substantial features of the case, in its relations to our
                                national character and duty, and to the principles and policy of our
                                government, are all that were before the mind of the President in
                                determining his action, and all that have any place in this
                                discussion.</p>
                            <p>The request made by the Spanish minister for the extradition of
                                Arguelles to the justice of his government, recognized the relations
                                of the two governments <pb facs="0078" n="54" xml:id="pg_54"/> as
                                imposing no express or stipulated obligations upon one or the other
                                for the reciprocal surrender of fugitive criminals, and placed the
                                application upon the grounds of comity, in the interests of justice
                                and humanity. Although we had never had, in the whole course of our
                                amicable and intimate diplomatic and commercial relations with
                                Spain, any treaty clause for the extradition of criminals, it was a
                                most pertinent and important consideration for the President, in
                                meeting this request of the Spanish government, that our government
                                had not hesitated, with some frequency, when its important interests
                                were concerned, to make similar demands upon the comity of the
                                Spanish government in the same interests of justice and humanity.
                                Our commerce with the Spanish West Indies, carried on almost
                                entirely by our own marine, made us frequent applicants to the
                                Spanish government for the extradition of seamen of our vessels
                                charged with mutiny, murder, and piracy. It is believed that to all
                                such applications the promptest and most respectful compliance has
                                been yielded by the Spanish government, and it may well be doubted
                                whether our extensive and valuable West India trade could have
                                reached and maintained its prosperity had the Spanish ports
                                furnished protection and immunity to these maritime offences. The
                                consular correspondence on the files of the Department of State
                                exhibits many cases of these extraditions, all resting upon the same
                                grounds of international relations between the governments, upon
                                which the case of Arguelles was put by the Spanish minister and
                                treated by the President. A brief notice of a few cases will
                                illustrate our obligations to Spain in this behalf, and the
                                sentiments and policy upon which our government, with the universal
                                approval of the people, has proceeded. In 1857 three seamen were
                                arrested, lodged in jail in Havana, and sent to this country in
                                irons, charged with the murder of the master, two mates, and a
                                seaman of the brig Albion, of Portland. In 1860 several prisoners
                                were sent from Havana to this country, charged with a murder on
                                board the Henry Warner, <hi rend="italic">committed in the port of
                                    Havana.</hi> In 1861 a seaman was sent to this country, as a
                                prisoner, from Havana, charged with mutiny and stabbing the chief
                                mate of the brig Nebraska, <hi rend="italic">the crime having been
                                    committed in the port of Havana.</hi> And in the same year two
                                seamen were surrendered as prisoners, and sent home from Havana,
                                charged with mutiny and stabbing the mate of the ship Ocean
                                Traveller. In all these cases the authority of the captain general
                                of Cuba was exerted to the end of these extraditions at the request
                                of our consuls, and as early as the year 1835 the footing upon which
                                this action was had was settled in the correspondence of Consul
                                Trist with the captain general of Cuba, according to the statement
                                of the latter, as being “without prejudice to this (the local)
                                jurisdiction, and in the spirit of cultivating harmony with the
                                United States.”</p>
                            <p>It is apparent, upon these established relations between our
                                government and that of Spain in the extradition of criminals “upon
                                the grounds of comity and in the interests of justice and
                                humanity”—relations the permanence of which was of continual
                                importance to our commerce—that it was impossible for the President
                                to treat the equivalent application of the Spanish government
                                otherwise than as that government had dealt with our requests; that
                                is to say, according to the character and circumstances of the case
                                presented.</p>
                            <p>But if our attitude and obligation towards the government of Spain on
                                the general subject of the reciprocal extradition of criminals was
                                such as I have stated, our attitude and obligations towards all
                                Christian states on the subject of the African slave trade were
                                special, unequivocal, and emphatic. The crime of Arguelles touched
                                this subject in its most vital point, and the application of the
                                Spanish minister for his surrender for punishment, exhibited an
                                earnest and practical purpose of the Spanish government to concur
                                with the policy of this government and of Great Britain for the
                                absolute extermination of this infamous traffic, by suppressing the
                                slave market in Cuba. This co-operation on the part of Spain had
                                seemed so essential to the success <pb facs="0079" n="55"
                                    xml:id="pg_55"/> of the combined efforts of the governments of
                                the United States and of Great Britain, that, at the very moment of
                                the occurrences in the island of Cuba which gave rise to the
                                application for the extradition of Arguelles, these two governments
                                were about uniting in a representation to the government of Spain on
                                the urgent occasion for efficient and decisive measures on its part
                                for breaking up the market for slaves in Cuba. The point of this
                                representation was the better securing the freedom of slaves landed
                                on the island of Cuba when these unlawful importations were
                                detected. This step on the part of this government was taken in
                                pursuance of the interest and policy which had induced the
                                stipulation of the ninth article of the treaty of Washington, that
                                the parties to that treaty would unite in all becoming
                                representations and remonstrances with any and all powers within
                                whose dominions markets for African negroes were allowed to exist.
                                The correspondence, heretofore referred to as laid before the
                                Senate, shows the communications on this subject between the
                                governments of Great Britain and the United States, and between
                                them, respectively, and the government of Spain.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to conceive a situation in which the request for the
                                surrender of a criminal could have been enforced by more clear or
                                more weighty considerations of our own national policy and
                                engagements, to apply all just means of influence or of action in
                                aid of the objects sought, and to be promoted by the application,
                                than this case of Arguelles presents.</p>
                            <p>The preceding suggestions, however weighty, are quite independent of
                                and introductory to what usually must constitute the sole elements
                                of consideration upon which the Executive is to determine, whether
                                or not a proposed case of extradition should or should not call
                                forth the exercise of this power and duty under the law of nations,
                                and the precepts of humane and Christian civilization. These
                                elements are the traits of the alleged criminality, as involving
                                heinous guilt against the laws of universal morality and the safety
                                of human society, and the gravity of the consequences which will
                                attend the exercise of the power in question, or its refusal.</p>
                            <p>The crime imputed to Arguelles, whether it be regarded as an offence
                                against the justice of his own country, or against society and
                                humanity, is of too dark a character to be deepened by epithets or
                                invective. Holding high official position under the crown of Spain,
                                and appointed in that office to the discharge of a particular and
                                important trust in the interest of humanity for the rescue from
                                perpetual slavery of the wretched victims of the nefarious traffic
                                which our laws denounce as piracy, a crime against the human race,
                                he is charged with having himself sold into personal bondage one
                                hundred and forty-one of these poor creatures, making to himself the
                                great gain of their merchandise, and covering this violence from
                                detection by manifold artifices of fraud, while at the same time he
                                receives from a grateful government a large reward for his supposed
                                fidelity and efficiency in carrying out its beneficent purposes in
                                the trust confided to him. It is perceived at once that every
                                circumstance which, in the view of the publicists, may be rightfully
                                required by a sovereign power as a condition for the exercise of the
                                authority of extradition, is here present in an extreme measure.</p>
                            <p>But the case presented to the Executive upon the request of the
                                minister of Spain did not limit its appeal to considerations
                                touching the punishment of heinous crime and the general interests
                                of social and human welfare which make this the policy of all
                                civilized nations. The representations of the Spanish authorities
                                made it evident that the presentation of the person of Arguelles for
                                trial under the offended laws of his own country was a necessary
                                step towards the relief from their misery of the numerous victims of
                                his crime. The subjection of Arguelles to trial was the key which
                                was to unlock their dungeons, and thus a responsibility of
                                inestimable force and vividness was impressed upon the President’s
                                decision. Negative action, as towards Arguelles and his punishment
                                    <pb facs="0080" n="56" xml:id="pg_56"/> became affirmative
                                action for the continuance of his inhuman oppressions, and of the
                                woes his crime had inflicted upon this crowd of innocent sufferers.
                                That the chief magistrate of a great nation, in whom the law of
                                nations and the Constitution of his country had reposed the power to
                                meet this exigency, should hesitate to exercise it, upon cold and
                                timid calculations of official ease, would be to make himself the
                                careless spectator of the unaided misery, if not the moral
                                accomplice of the unpunished crime.</p>
                            <p>Upon these considerations, then, it would seem that the action of the
                                President of the United States, in directing the extradition of
                                Arguelles upon the application of the government of Spain, was in
                                pursuance of a national authority, sanctioned by the law of nations;
                                was in exercise of an executive function belonging to his office
                                under the Constitution; was not in derogation of any right of
                                asylum; was a just recognition of our relations with a friendly
                                power; was conformed to the cherished policy of this country for the
                                extinction of the traffic in slaves, and was an obligation to
                                justice and humanity which could not have been withheld.</p>

                                        been in possession of information from an official and
                                        reliable source that the Hamburg ship Deutschland, which
                                        vessel sailed from Hamburg to this port on the 2d of August,
                                        and arrived here 17th instant, consigned to your address,
                                        had on board four criminals as passengers, who were sent
                                        here by the order and at the expense of the authorities of
                                        Güstrow, Duchy of Mechlenburg Schwerin, direct from the
                                        penal establishment at that place. On the arrival of the
                                        vessel, as you know, I caused the detention at the
                                        quarantine, so as to institute there a rigid inquiry into
                                        the character of her passengers, and particularly with
                                        reference to the four persons referred to. This examination
                                        has confirmed the truth of the representations made to me in
                                        part by the admissions of the criminals themselves.</p>
                                    <p>They have been removed from the vessel and are now detained
                                        by my orders, awaiting the return of the Deutschland to
                                        Hamburg, by which opportunity I intend they shall be sent
                                        back to those who so inhumanely have sought to abuse the
                                        hospitality of this country. The immediate object of this
                                        communication is to ask on what day the vessel will probably
                                        sail, not doubting, from the respectable character of your
                                        firm, that you will readily co-operate with me in stopping
                                        the ingress into this port of persons of this class.</p>

                                    <p>It is my determination to return all such, forthwith, in

                                        expense of those who bring or those who send them. That
                                        which was intended as a pecuniary or moral advantage will
                                        thus cease to be so, for, besides the exposure to be

                                        Güstrow, duchy of Mechlenburg Schwerin, by order and at the
                                        expense of the authorities of that place.</p>
                                    <p>We beg to repeat herewith what we already expressed to you
                                        verbally, that the owners of the Deutschland are entirely
                                        unaware of the unfavorable character of the four passengers
                                        referred to, and that nothing would be further from their
                                        thought than to have their vessel and their confidence
                                        abused by the smuggling on board of any passengers who are
                                        sent from penal establishments. We feel certain that the
                                        present case will cause the greatest indignation to the
                                        owners of the Deutschland—the more so, as the line to which
                                        the vessel belongs was established less with a view to
                                        pecuniary profit, than in order to promote the welfare and
                                        comfort of the German emigrants. The Deutschland will sail
                                        from here to Hamburg about the 10th of next month, and we
                                        shall reserve room for the four persons, so as to return
                                        them to where they came from. We shall give you timely
                                        notice when the vessel is ready.</p>
                                    <p>Very respectfully, your most obedient servants,</p>

                                    5th ultimo, accompanying a copy of a note from Lord Lyons of the
                                    preceding date, I have to state that, notwithstanding the most
                                    diligent inquiries among my friends, I have been unable to
                                    ascertain the name of the steamer that brought the large lot of
                                    African negroes (upwards of a thousand) captured by the Spanish
                                    authorities. These negroes were landed in the district of Colon,
                                    on the south side of this island. The steamer had been
                                    originally English; came from England to Cadiz, where she was
                                    put under Spanish colors, fitted out for the slave trade, and
                                    cleared ostensibly for a lawful voyage to Fernando Po, a Spanish
                                    island on the coast of Africa.</p>
                                <p>The negroes were captured on shore by the lieutenant governor of
                                    the district, and I am confidentially informed that the steamer
                                    proceeded again to Africa for another load of the same kind, the
                                    necessary stores having been placed on board <pb facs="0083"
                                        n="59" xml:id="pg_59"/> immediately on the discharge of her
                                    cargo. It is said that Don Julian Zulueta, Don Salvador Sania,
                                    Marquis of Marianao, the Brigadier Garcia Munoz, and other
                                    prominent persons, among whom General Concha is mentioned, were
                                    interested in that expedition.</p>
                                <p>Several slave expeditions have been landed for the same parties;
                                    but two besides the above have been captured, one of about six
                                    hundred negroes and the other of about two hundred, most of the
                                    cargo of this latter having been landed, and the vessel
                                    conveying them has the appearance of being English-built. Don
                                    José Carreras, a partner of Mr. S. Senia, has been for some time
                                    past in confinement, charged with being implicated in these
                                    violations of law. Should any further trustworthy information
                                    reach me I will not fail to transmit it at the eariest
                                    opportunity.</p>
                                <p>I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                                        interview had with the captain general by his request, the
                                        object of which was to ascertain if the United States
                                        authorities can return to this island the person of an
                                        officer of the Spanish army named Don José Agustin
                                        Arguelles, who is believed to be in New York. This officer
                                        was, in November last, the lieutenant governor of the
                                        district of Colon, in this island, that effected the capture
                                        of the large expedition of African negroes reported by me to
                                        the department on the 20th of November last, despatch No.
                                        107. The government was highly pleased with his zeal, and
                                        paid him $15,000 for his share of the prize money usually
                                        allowed to captors of such expeditions. The officer
                                        subsequently obtained a leave of absence of twenty days,
                                        upon his represenation that the object of his journey to New
                                        York was to purchase the Spanish journal there published,
                                        called La Cronica, has not returned, and since his departure
                                        it has been discovered that he and other officers of the
                                        district of Colon retained and sold into slavery one hundred
                                        and forty-one of the negroes captured by them. Some of these
                                        negroes were sold at $700, and others at $750 each.</p>

                                        jurisdiction over such causes, has taken cognizance of this
                                        case, and requires the presentation of Don José <pb
                                            facs="0084" n="60" xml:id="pg_60"/> Agustin Arguelles
                                        before it, to insure the prompt liberation of these one
                                        hundred and forty-one victims. The captain general gave me
                                        to understand that, without Arguelles’s presence, it would
                                        be very difficult, and, at all events, it would require a
                                        long time to attain that humane object. His excellency
                                        pronounced Arguelles to be a scoundrel, worse than a thief
                                        or highwayman, inasmuch as he took advantage of his
                                        position, as the local authority, to commit that outrage
                                        with little risk to himself.</p>
                                    <p>I told the captain general that in the absence of an
                                        extradition treaty between the two governments, or of any
                                        law, public or municipal, authorizing the rendition, our
                                        government could not grant the request, but promised to lay
                                        the matter in this confidential way before you, which he
                                        desired me to do by the earliest opportunity.</p>

                                    this day received from the consul general of the United States
                                    at Havana, that over one thousand African negroes were recently
                                    brought to that city. It is reported that they were landed from
                                    a steamship, whose name and nationality are unknown, in the
                                    neighborhood of Cardenas, or Sagua, and that very prominent and
                                    wealthy persons are said to be implicated in the business. The
                                    steamer was not captured. It is believed that she went to Nassau
                                    after landing the negroes. This intelligence has been
                                    communicated to the Navy Department.</p>

                                    President’s instructions upon the suggestion, communicated in
                                    your note of October 15, of Earl Russell, concerning a joint or
                                    concurrent appeal to be addressed to the government of Spain for
                                    an amendment of her law which tolerates the bondage of imported
                                    Africans landed in Cuba after they have become in form the
                                    property of an owner of an estate in that island. If Earl
                                    Russell, with his large experience of this evil and of the
                                    difficulty of obtaining a correction of it, will prepare the

                                    the liberal and humane sentiments which have inspired the

                                    in which you did me the honor to inform me that if his lordship
                                    would prepare the draught of such a communication as might, in

                                    a view to procure an amendment of the laws affecting the
                                    introduction of slaves into Cuba, the President of the United
                                    States would authorize you to communicate with the government of
                                    Spain in the same sense and spirit with those adopted by her
                                    Majesty’s government.</p>
                                <p>Lord Russell has desired me to thank you for taking the
                                    President’s instructions on this matter at a time when other
                                    pressing affairs must have occupied the attention of the Chief
                                    Magistrate. He has also authorized me to communicate to you the
                                    enclosed copies of a despatch from her Majesty’s minister at
                                    Madrid, and of a note in which, in execution of instructions
                                    from her Majesty’s government, that minister has pointed out to
                                    the government of Spain the measures which, in the opinion of
                                    her Majesty’s government, are required for the suppression of
                                    the Cuban slave trade.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s government do not doubt that a similar
                                    representation addressed to the government of Spain by the
                                    United States minister at Madrid would have great weight with
                                    the Spanish cabinet, and they would learn with much satisfaction
                                    that the United States representative had been directed to make
                                    a communication to the Spanish minister for foreign affairs in
                                    the same sense as that made by her Majesty’s minister in the

                                    <p>The present captain general of Cuba has acted in good faith
                                        in carrying out the treaty obligations of Spain for the
                                        suppression of the slave trade, and the Spanish government
                                        appears to have hitherto approved the proceedings of that
                                        officer. The result has been that the number of slaves
                                        introduced into Cuba within the twelve months ended the 30th
                                        of last September is estimated at from seven to eight
                                        thousand, as compared with eleven thousand two hundred and
                                        fifty-four, the number introduced in the corresponding
                                        twelve months of the preceding year.</p>
                                    <p>This diminution in the Cuban slave traffic would be
                                        satisfactory if it were not that it is mainly owing to the
                                        exertions of one individual alone, General Dulce, the
                                        present captain general of Cuba, who, it must be borne in
                                        mind, is liable to be removed at any moment, when, in all
                                        probability, the traffic would again resume its wonted
                                        vigor.</p>
                                    <p>General Dulce complains bitterly of the want of sufficient
                                        power conferred <pb facs="0086" n="62" xml:id="pg_62"/> upon
                                        him, and of the inadequacy of the provisions of the Spanish
                                        penal code for suppressing the Cuban slave trade; and if an
                                        officer so well disposed as is the present captain general
                                        of Cuba finds it impossible to put a stop to the importation
                                        of slaves into Cuba, it may be easily inferred that a less
                                        honorable officer would find ample excuses for the
                                        non-performance of his duties in this respect.</p>
                                    <p>In order to put an end to the slave trade in Cuba, it is
                                        necessary that the Spanish government should take steps for
                                        amending the laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves
                                        into that island. The existing laws are admitted by the
                                        Spanish authorities to be insufficient for the purposes for
                                        which they were framed, and until they are amended the
                                        sincerity and good faith of the Spanish government will be
                                        liable to be called in question.</p>
                                    <p>The 4th and 13th articles of the penal code only serve as a
                                        protection to the slave dealers. The former of these
                                        articles prohibits the seizure by the authorities of any
                                        newly imported slaves, no matter how notorious may have been
                                        the violation of the Spanish laws in introducing the
                                        negroes, if once the slaves have been conveyed to a property
                                        or plantation in the island.</p>
                                    <p>The 13th article, on the other hand, provides that the legal
                                        punishment of slave dealers and their accomplices can only
                                        be inflicted in virtue of a sentence of the “Royal Audiencia
                                        Pretorial;” but in consequence of nearly the whole of the
                                        population of Cuba, as well as the subordinate authorities,
                                        being more or less mixed up and interested in the slave
                                        trade, it is impossible to procure evidence to convict the
                                        parties engaged in the traffic, and this article remains,
                                        therefore, entirely inoperative.</p>
                                    <p>Eleven hundred slaves have, as is well known to the
                                        government of the United States, been recently seized by the
                                        captain general of Cuba after they had been successfully
                                        landed and conveyed to a plantation in that island. Attempts
                                        will doubtless be made to procure their restitution on the
                                        ground that they have been illegally seized by the captain
                                        general; but if one of these negroes is given up to the
                                        slave dealers, either by the orders of the Spanish
                                        government or by the decision of a judicial tribunal, her
                                        Majesty’s government trust that the government of the United
                                        States will unite with her Majesty’s government in
                                        addressing a serious remonstrance on the subject to the
                                        Spanish government.</p>

                                        wish expressed by your excellency in the conversation which
                                        I had the honor of holding with you on the 14th instant upon
                                        the subject of the slave trade in the island of Cuba, I
                                        proceed to particularize in writing those measures to which
                                        I alluded as being, in the opinion of her Majesty’s
                                        government, calculated to put a final stop to that
                                        deplorable traffic, the adoption of which measures I am
                                        instructed to press upon her Catholic Majesty’s
                                        government.</p>
                                    <p>As I had the honor of stating to your excellency, the
                                        government of the Queen, my mistress, have learned with
                                        extreme satisfaction, from the official reports of her
                                        Majesty’s consul at Havana, that a considerable diminution
                                        in the number of negroes illegally imported into Cuba within
                                        the year ending the 5th of September last has taken place,
                                        as compared with former years, and also that a well-judged
                                        amelioration in the treatment of those legally held in
                                        slavery there has been encouraged by the authorities of her
                                        Catholic Majesty—a measure, as her Majesty’s consul remarks,
                                        which has happily combined a regard for humanity and a
                                        sensible increase in the productivenenss of the plantations
                                        in which it has been adopted.</p>
                                    <p>Her Majesty’s government have pleasure in recognizing the
                                        good will and <pb facs="0087" n="63" xml:id="pg_63"/>
                                        activity displayed by the present captain general of Cuba,
                                        as well as the measure of his success, in checking the slave
                                        trade. It appears, however, that such are the temptations to
                                        unprincipled individuals to introduce slaves into Cuba, and
                                        such the facilities still afforded to them by the defects of
                                        certain parts of the Spanish laws regarding the subject,
                                        that without some modifications in these, his well-meant
                                        efforts must continue to fall short of their intended
                                        object.</p>
                                    <p>The measures to which her Majesty’s government would call
                                        your excellency’s attention are—</p>
                                    <p>1st. An enactment declaring slave trade to be piracy. This is
                                        a measure which has been adopted by many nations, including
                                        those possessing large numbers of slaves. Its success has
                                        been signal in checking the slave trade in countries where
                                        it most prevailed. It has mainly contributed to free Brazil
                                        from the stigma attaching to this inhuman traffic, and that
                                        without any injury to her productiveness or material
                                        prosperity. Her Majesty’s government are not aware of any
                                        sound argument which can be alleged against this
                                        measure.</p>
                                    <p>2d. A modification of the 9th and 13th articles of the
                                        Spanish penal code in force in the island of Cuba.</p>
                                    <p>According to the former of these articles, the authorities
                                        cannot seize imported negroes when once they have been
                                        conveyed to a property or plantation, however notorious the
                                        fact of such violation of the law having been committed may
                                        be.</p>
                                    <p>According to the latter, the legal punishment of slave
                                        traders and their accomplices can only be inflicted in
                                        virtue of a sentence by the Royal Audencia Pretorial. Now,
                                        it is well known that the difficulty of producing evidence
                                        before this court is so great, that proof to convict those
                                        accused of such charges is seldom, if ever obtained, however
                                        morally convinced the ruling authorities may be of their
                                        guilt. It is true that the captain general has power to
                                        remove officers of whose delinquency he feels certain, and
                                        it is true that the present Captain General Dulce, his
                                        predecessor, the Duke de la Torre, and others, have
                                        exercised this power in regard to certain flagrant cases;
                                        but how much more effective as regards public opinion, how
                                        much more satisfactory to her Catholic Majesty’s government,
                                        would it be that such punishment and degradation should
                                        result from a legal conviction, rather than from the
                                        exercise of discretional power.</p>
                                    <p>I believe that in stating that the experience of the Duke de
                                        la Torre, as well as that of General Dulce, have caused them
                                        to coincide in the opinion that the adoption of both the
                                        measures to which I have above adverted would be expedient
                                        and necessary for the final extirpation of the slave trade
                                        in Cuba. I am not overstepping the truth in bringing,
                                        however, these measures under your excellency’s attention. I
                                        feel confident that they will be submitted to the
                                        enlightened examination due to the intrinsic merits of the
                                        great end they are meant to forward, and also with the most
                                        friendly disposition on your excellency’s part to set at
                                        rest forever a serious and painful matter of discussion
                                        between the governments of Great Britain and Spain.</p>

                                        that General Dulce, by the manner in which he had acted, had
                                        faithfully carried out the wishes of her Catholic Majesty’s
                                        government, I observed that, such being the case, I could
                                        feel no doubt that his excellency would take into serious
                                        consideration two measures, which appeared to her Majesty’s
                                        government, and, indeed, to all persons acquainted with the
                                        subject, were wanting to enable that officer, who does not
                                        lack the will, to put a stop at once to the importation of
                                        slaves into Cuba, and to realize a wish which his excellency
                                        had so often concurred with me in expressing, that the
                                        serious and painful question which was continually recurring
                                        between the two governments in regard to this matter should
                                        be forever set at rest.</p>
                                    <p>The two measures I alluded to were, I said: 1st. An enactment
                                        declaring the slave trade to be piracy. 2d. The modification
                                        of the penal code in force in Cuba, and particularly of the
                                        9th and 13th articles.</p>
                                    <p>With respect to the first of these measures, I observed that
                                        its efficacy had been shown in the case of Brazil, and no
                                        reasonable objection had ever been alleged against it by the
                                        Spanish government.</p>
                                    <p>With respect to the second, the 9th and 13th articles of the
                                        code acted as a protection to the slave-traders, and
                                        defeated the intention of the law and the well-intended
                                        efforts of the Spanish superior authorities. The Marquis of
                                        Miraflores promised that he would take these matters into
                                        his consideration, and assured me that good will on his part
                                        would not be found wanting to do all that was possible to
                                        put an end to the slave trade.</p>
                                    <p>As I had referred to particular articles of the penal code,
                                        he requested me to address him a note, in which they should
                                        be particularized, in order that he might be able at once to
                                        direct his attention to the points to which her Majesty’s
                                        government alluded.</p>
                                    <p>I have consequently, in the note of which I have the honor to
                                        enclose a copy, pointed out to the Marquis de Miraflores the
                                        effect of the articles 9 and 13 of the code, which are
                                        clearly stated in Mr. Crawford’s report No. 12, of September
                                        30, 1361, enclosed in your lordship’s of that year.</p>

                                    Majesty’s government the note dated the 21st instant (28th
                                    November last,) in which you did me the honor to inform me that
                                    you had learned from the United States consul general at Havana
                                    that more than one thousand recently imported African negroes
                                    had been brought to that city.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s government had already received intelligence of a
                                    steam vessel having left the African coast with a cargo of
                                    upwards of 1,100 slaves on board, and also of these slaves
                                    having been landed in Cuba. They have since been informed by her
                                    Majesty’s consul general at Havana that eleven hundred and five
                                    of the newly imported slaves have been seized by the captain
                                    general of Cuba.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s government are not at present acquainted with the
                                    particulars relative to the vessel from which the slaves were
                                    landed, but they will take <pb facs="0089" n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                    /> measures to discover, if possible, the name of the vessel and
                                    the parties implicated in her proceedings, and they will be very
                                    much obliged if the government of the United States will
                                    communicate to them any information on the subject which the
                                    United States authorities may be able to furnish.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By the 9th article of the treaty
                                    of Washington, of the 9th of August 1842, between the United
                                    States and Great Britain, it is stipulated that the parties will
                                    unite in all becoming representations and remonstrances with any
                                    and all powers within whose dominions such markets (for African
                                    negroes) are allowed to exist, and that they will urge upon all
                                    such powers the propriety and duty of closing such markets
                                    effectually at once and forever.</p>
                                <p>Spain is believed to be the only Christian state in whose
                                    dominions African negroes are now introduced as slaves. She has
                                    a treaty with Great Britain stipulating for the suppression of
                                    that traffic. The instrument was concluded at a time and under
                                    circumstances which, as it seems to us, imposes a peculiar
                                    weight of moral obligation on Spain to see that her stipulations
                                    were carried into full effect. It is understood, however, that
                                    the just expectations of the British government in that respect
                                    have been signally disappointed. This has, no doubt, been mostly
                                    owing to the fact that a great part of the public revenue of
                                    Spain has hitherto been derived from Cuba, the prosperity of
                                    which island has in some quarters been erroneously supposed to
                                    depend upon a continued supply of imported slave labor. This is
                                    believed to be the source of the disregard of Cuban slave
                                    dealers of the humane policy of the home government, and the
                                    alleged inefficiency at times of the colonial authorities.</p>
                                <p>We have no treaty with Spain on the subject of the slave trade;
                                    but as the laws of the United States characterized it as piracy
                                    long before our treaty with <pb facs="0090" n="66"
                                        xml:id="pg_66"/> Great Britain above referred to, we think
                                    ourselves entitled to consider that trade an offence against
                                    public law, so far as to warrant our faithful compliance with
                                    the stipulation contained in that treaty. Herewith I transmit a
                                    copy of an informal note on this subject, of the 4th instant,
                                    addressed to me by Lord Lyons, and of the papers to which it
                                    refers. From these it appears, that though the number of
                                    Africans introduced into Cuba is diminishing, yet that the
                                    municipal laws in force there require amendment before a
                                    stoppage of the traffic can be expected. The peculiar relations
                                    of Great Britain to Spain, with reference to this topic, may
                                    justify to the full extent the text of the note of Sir John
                                    Crampton to the Marquis of Miraflores. The relations of the
                                    United States to Spain, however, are of a different character;
                                    but the President authorizes and directs you to address a
                                    communication in general terms to the Spanish minister for
                                    foreign affairs, setting forth the treaty stipulations between
                                    the United States and Great Britain on this subject, and stating
                                    that it would afford the utmost satisfaction in this country if
                                    any obstacles existing in Cuba to the complete suppression of
                                    the African slave trade should be removed.</p>

                                    Spain the measures which, in the opinion of her Majesty’s
                                    government, are required for the suppression of the Cuban slave

                                    compelled to make to the Spanish government respecting certain

                                    also informed me of the President’s promises to support the

                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The subject of suppressing the
                                        inhuman African slave trade has been one of deep anxiety to
                                        the government of the United States from the time of its
                                        foundation. The United States have been among the first of
                                        nations, if not the first, that have denounced this traffic
                                        in human beings as piracy, and have visited their own
                                        citizens implicated in it with the severest penalties. At
                                        very heavy pecuniary sacrifices, and at the risk of the
                                        lives of their own naval officers and seamen, they have for
                                        more than twenty years supported a squadron on the western
                                        coast of Africa, in a most destructive climate, in order to
                                        prevent the successful carrying on of this nefarious trade.
                                        They have, with a like view, entered into stipulations with
                                        her Britannic Majesty in the year 1842, contained in what is
                                        called the treaty of Washington, the 9th article of which is
                                        as follows:</p>
                                    <p>(Here follows the article entire.)</p>
                                    <p>The attention of the President of the United States has
                                        lately been directed to certain difficulties which have
                                        presented themselves, and which appear to prevent a complete
                                        suppression of the slave trade in the colonial possessions
                                        of her Catholic Majesty, and more especially in the island
                                        of Cuba, which difficulties do not arise from any desire of
                                        the Spanish colonial authorities to favor the said trade. It
                                        is well known that the efforts made by the captain general
                                        of that Island correspond entire to the wise and humane
                                        policy which the home government of her Catholic Majesty has
                                        adopted in regard to the subject in question, and which is
                                        thoroughly appreciated by the President and the people of
                                        the United States.</p>
                                    <p>The difficulties spoken of seem to be inherent in the laws
                                        and regulations in existence, which are supposed to give
                                        room to interpretations by which their force may be
                                        evaded.</p>
                                    <p>In view of the general policy of the United States, which
                                        looks upon the African slave trade as an offence againt the
                                        public law of nations, and has denounced it as piracy; in
                                        view, also, of the treaty stipulations existing between them
                                        and the government of her Britannic Majesty, the President
                                        of the United States has instructed me to respectfully call
                                        the attention of her Catholic Majesty’s government to this
                                        subject, and to suggest such a revision of the existing laws
                                        and regulations concerning the unlawful introduction of
                                        slaves into the island of Cuba as will best accomplish the
                                        object which her Majesty’s government had in view when those
                                        laws and regulations were enacted.</p>
                                    <p>It is hardly necessary for the undersigned to assure your
                                        excellency that <pb facs="0092" n="68" xml:id="pg_68"/>
                                        these suggestions arise from the purest motives, and would
                                        not have been made unless the President had considered the
                                        very friendly and cordial relations existing between the

                                    <p>It is almost equally unnecessary for me to inform your
                                        excellency that it would afford the utmost satisfaction to
                                        the President and the people of the United States if any
                                        obstacles existing in the island of Cuba to the complete
                                        suppression of the African slave trade should be removed by
                                        the considerate action of the government of her Catholic

                            <p>The Secretary of State, to whom was referred the resolution of the
                                Senate of the 28th instant requesting the President to inform that
                                body, “if he shall not deem it incompatible with the public
                                interest, whether he has, and when, authorized a person, alleged to
                                have committed a crime against Spain, or any of its dependencies, to
                                be delivered up to officers of that government; and whether such
                                delivery was had; and, if so, under what authority of law or of
                                treaty it was done,” has the honor to submit to the President a copy
                                of the papers which are on file or on record in this department
                                relative to the subject of the resolution.</p>
                            <p>By the act of Congress of the 15th of May, 1820, the African slave
                                trade is declared to be piracy. By the ninth article of the treaty
                                of 1842 with Great Britain, it is stipulated that, “Whereas,
                                notwithstanding all efforts which may be made on the coast of Africa
                                for suppressing the slave trade, the facilities for carrying on that
                                traffic, and avoiding the vigilance of cruisers, by the fraudulent
                                use of flags and other means, are so great, and the temptations for
                                pursuing it, while a market can be found for slaves, so strong, as
                                that the desired result may be long delayed unless all markets be
                                shut against the purchase of African negroes, the parties to this
                                treaty agree that they will unite in all becoming representations
                                and remonstrances with any and all powers within whose dominions
                                such markets are allowed to exist, and that they will urge upon all
                                such powers the propriety and duty of closing such markets
                                effectually at once and forever.”</p>
                            <p>There being no treaty of extradition between the United States and
                                Spain, nor any act of Congress directing how fugitives from justice
                                in Spanish dominions shall be delivered up, the extradition in the
                                case referred to in the resolution of the Senate is understood by
                                this department to have been made in virtue of the law of nations
                                and the Constitution of the United States.</p>
                            <pb facs="0093" n="69" xml:id="pg_69"/>
                            <p>Although there is a conflict of authorities concerning the expediency
                                of exercising comity towards a foreign government by surrendering,
                                at its request, one of its own subjects charged with the commission
                                of crime within its territory, and although it may be conceded that
                                there is no national obligation to make such a surrender upon a
                                demand therefor, unless it is acknowledged by treaty or by statute
                                law, yet a nation is never bound to furnish asylum to dangerous
                                criminals who are offenders against the human race, and it is
                                believed that if, in any case, the comity could with propriety be
                                practiced, the one which is understood to have called forth the
                                resolution furnished a just occasion for its exercise.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

                                    were brought to this city a few days since. It is reported that

                                    prominent and wealthy persons are said to be implicated in this

                                <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
                                    of her Catholic Majesty, has received information of the arrival
                                    in this country of an officer of the Spanish army, named Don
                                    José Agustin Arguelles, escaped from the island of Cuba under
                                    the charge of having sold negroes into slavery.</p>
                                <p>The circumstances of the case seem to be as follows:</p>
                                <p>The above named officer was, in November last, lieutenant
                                    governor of the district of Colon, and effected, whilst in this
                                    capacity, the seizure of a large expedition of African negroes.
                                    The government, pleased with his zeal, paid him a large sum as
                                    his share of the prize money usually allowed to the captors of
                                    such expeditions. The officer subsequently obtained a leave of
                                    absence of twenty days to proceed to New York, upon representing
                                    that the object of his journey was to purchase a Spanish journal
                                    published in that city, but since his departure it has been
                                    discovered that he and other officers of the district of Colon
                                    retained and sold into slavery one hundred and forty-one of the
                                    negroes <pb facs="0094" n="70" xml:id="pg_70"/> captured by
                                    them. The superior court of the island, having exclusive
                                    jurisdiction over such causes, has taken cognizance of this
                                    case, and requires the presence of Arguelles before it to insure
                                    the prompt liberation of the one hundred and forty-one victims.
                                    Without such presentation it would be very difficult, and, at
                                    all events, it would require a long time to attain that humane
                                    object.</p>
                                <p>The undersigned is well aware that no extradition treaty exists
                                    between the United States and Spain, in virtue of which the
                                    surrender of Arguelles to the authorities of Cuba might be
                                    obtained. Yet, considering the gross and scandalous outrage
                                    which has been committed, as well as the interests of humanity
                                    at stake in the prompt resolution of this matter, he has not
                                    hesitated in submitting the case in this confidential way to the
                                    consideration of the United States government, in order to
                                    ascertain whether an incident so exceptional could not be met
                                    with exceptional measures.</p>
                                <p>The undersigned has been the more induced to take this step, that
                                    he has good reason to believe a similar application to have been
                                    made also in a confidential form by the captain general of
                                    Cuba.</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge
                                    the reception of despatches from the department, Nos.70 to 77,
                                    both inclusive. I also received yesterday the despatch, No. 79,
                                    signed by F. W. Seward, Assistant Secretary, and immediately
                                    communicated the purport thereof, in confidence, to the captain
                                    general. He had likewise a despatch from the Spanish minister at
                                    Washington, advising him of the interview he had had with you on
                                    the subject of the rendition of the Spanish officer, Don José
                                    Arguelles. His excellency was very much pleased, and very warmly
                                    expressed his thanks to me for the promptness with which I had
                                    attended to his request in this matter. He read me the Spanish
                                    minister’s letter, and said that he would send a proper officer
                                    to perform the service, who will probably proceed to New York by
                                    the steamer Columbia on Monday next, and, on arrival,
                                    immediately repair to Washington and place himself under the
                                    direction of the Spanish minister.</p>
                                <p>In this connexion, I deem it proper to make known to you that the
                                    captain general is under the impression that Arguelles will be
                                    surrendered as accused of crime, to be subjected to trial here,
                                    in which case, from what I can learn, he will certainly be
                                    convicted and sentenced to the chain-gang, which will be the
                                    fate of the curate of Colon, and three or four others who were
                                    accomplices, aiders, and abettors of Arguelles in the nefarious
                                    business. I did not say anything to his excellency to the
                                    contrary, not feeling authorized to do so.</p>
                                <p>The one hundred and forty-one negroes sold into slavery by
                                    Arguelles, as alleged, were represented by him and his
                                    accomplices as having died of disease after landing, and the
                                    curate of Colon is charged with having made a new register of
                                    deaths, wherein those supposed deaths were inserted. This new
                                    register supplanted the regular one which the captain general
                                    says Arguelles took away and now has in his possession.
                                    Conclusive evidence of this fact is before the court.</p>
                                <p>I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient
                                    servant,</p>

                                    port for New York, I was unable to inform you of the arrival in
                                    Havana, per same steamer from New York, of the late lieutenant
                                    governor of Colon, José Agustin Arguelles. He arrived here at
                                    about 8 o’clock at night, accompanied by the captain general’s
                                    agent and two United States deputy marshals. He was immediately
                                    lodged in jail, and was next morning conveyed to Moro Castle,
                                    where he still remains. Various rumors were put in circulation
                                    on his arrival, which created considerable excitement. One rumor
                                    obtained great circulation, that he had been kidnapped from New
                                    York, and that the captain general intended to condemn him to
                                    the chain-gang.</p>

                                <head>The Arguelles case.</head>
                                <p>Early in the morning of the 11th ultimo Don José Agustin
                                    Arguelles, an officer of the Spanish army, sojourning in the
                                    city of New York, was seized by <pb facs="0097" n="73"
                                        xml:id="pg_73"/> authority of the President of the United
                                    States and secretly conveyed to a steamer in that port bound for
                                    Havana, in the island of Cuba. So secretly and summarily was the
                                    arrest effected, as he was in the act of making his morning
                                    toilette in a room adjoining the chamber of his wife, that his
                                    wife remained in ignorance of his condition or his destination
                                    until, some days afterwards, she learned both from the Spanish
                                    minister in this city.</p>
                                <p>From the official correspondence, which we published on Tuesday
                                    last, it will be seen that Colonel Arguelles was formerly the
                                    lieutenant governor of the district of Colon, in the island of
                                    Cuba, and that he effected the capture of a large cargo of
                                    African negroes illegally landed within that district on the
                                    20th of November last. The captain general, it is said, was
                                    highly pleased with his zeal, and paid him fifteen thousand
                                    dollars for his share of the prize money usually allowed to
                                    captors of such expeditions. Arguelles subsequently obtained a
                                    leave of absence of twenty days, upon his representation that
                                    the object of his journey to New York was to purchase the
                                    Spanish journal published in that city called “La Cronica.”</p>
                                <p>It is represented by the captain general that after the departure
                                    of Arguelles from Cuba it was discovered that he and other
                                    officers of the district of Colon had retained and sold into
                                    slavery one hundred and forty-one negroes captured by them. Some
                                    of these negroes, it is said, were sold at seven hundred
                                    dollars, and others at seven hundred and fifty dollars each. It
                                    is further represented that the superior court of the island,
                                    having exclusive jurisdiction over such causes, had taken
                                    cognizance of this case, and required the presentation of Don
                                    José Agustin Arguelles before it to insure the prompt liberation
                                    of those one hundred and forty-one victims. Without Arguelles’s
                                    presence it would be very difficult, or at all events it would
                                    require a long time, to attain that humane object.</p>
                                <p>Mr Thomas Savage, our vice-consul general at Havana, when
                                    approached on the subject of the reclamation of Colonel
                                    Arguelles, stated to the captain general of Cuba that, “in the
                                    absence of an extradition treaty between the two governments, or
                                    of any law, public or municipal, authorizing the rendition, our
                                    government could not grant the request,” but promised to lay the
                                    matter, in a confidential way, before the Department of
                                    State.</p>
                                <p>In like manner, Señor Don Gabriel G. Tassara, the Spanish
                                    minister at Washington, in communicating the facts of the case
                                    to our government, (employing almost the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >ipsissima verba</hi> of Mr. Savage, and thus showing that
                                    both Mr. Tassara and Mr. Savage wrote from representations
                                    prepared for them by the Cuban authorities,) took care to state
                                    that he was “well aware that no extradition treaty exists
                                    between the United States and Spain, in virtue of which the
                                    surrender of Arguelles to the authorities of Cuba might be
                                    obtained; yet, considering the gross and scandalous outrage
                                    which has been committed, as well as the interests of humanity
                                    at stake in the prompt resolution of this matter,” it was added,
                                    “he has not hesitated in submitting the case in this
                                    confidential way to the consideration of the United States
                                    government, in order to ascertain whether an incident so
                                    exceptional could not be met with exceptional measures.”</p>
                                <p>Thus addressed on the subject, the President ordered the
                                    “exceptional measure” of arresting and surrendering Colonel
                                    Arguelles on his sole responsibility, in the absence, as Mr.
                                    Savage phrases it, “of any extradition treaty, or of any law,
                                    public or municipal, authorizing the rendition” of the alleged
                                    fugitive from justice. And the Secretary of State, in reporting
                                    the transaction to Congress, is frank to avow that the
                                    “exceptional measure” was taken in obedience only to general
                                    considerations of international comity. To this effect he
                                    writes:</p>
                                <p>“There being no treaty of extradition between the United States
                                    and Spain, nor any act of Congress directing how fugitives from
                                    justice in Spanish dominions shall be delivered up, the
                                    extradition in the Arguelles case is understood by the State
                                    Department to have been made in virtue of the law of nations and
                                    the Constitution of the United States. Although <pb facs="0098"
                                        n="74" xml:id="pg_74"/> there is a conflict of authorities
                                    concerning the expediency of exercising comity towards a foreign
                                    government by surrendering, at its request, one of its own
                                    subjects charged with the commission of crime within its
                                    territory, and although it may be conceded that there is no
                                    national obligation to make such a surrender upon a demand
                                    therefor, unless it is acknowledged by treaty or by statute law,
                                    yet a nation is never bound to furnish asylums to dangerous
                                    criminals who are offenders against the human race; and it is
                                    believed that if, in any case, the comity could with propriety
                                    be practiced, the one which is understood to have called forth
                                    the resolution of inquiry of the Senate furnished a just
                                    occasion for its exercise.”</p>
                                <p>The apologetic language in which this statement is couched, and
                                    the candid manner in which the whole transaction is
                                    characterized by our consular representative at Havana, and by
                                    the Spanish minister in the very act of asking what he admits to
                                    be an “exceptional measure,” might perhaps be justly held to
                                    absolve us from the necessity of instituting any inquiry into
                                    the legal aspect of a question which is thus admitted on all
                                    hands to be outside of the sphere of law. But, as we have always
                                    been taught that our government is a government of <hi
                                        rend="italic">laws</hi> and not of <hi rend="italic"
                                        >men,</hi> it may be proper for us to restate the principle
                                    of international and municipal jurisprudence which we understand
                                    to govern the practice of civilized states in the mutual
                                    extradition of fugitives from justice.</p>
                                <p>There was a time in the history of nations when, as the laws then
                                    stood, alleged criminals might be lawfully surrendered, and when
                                    in fact they frequently were surrendered, by executive
                                    authoritiy alone. It was in the days when the monarch or ruler
                                    gathered into his single person lla the powers of the state, and
                                    when “the government” meant nothing more than the authority of
                                    the sovereign who swayed the destinies of the people. In his
                                    learned work on the Conflict of Laws, Judge Story states that
                                    the practice of mutually surrendering up fugitives from justice
                                    had long prevailed between neighboring nations under the civil
                                    law as a matter of comity and sometimes of treaty stipulation.
                                    Under the Roman Empire this right of having a criminal remitted
                                    for trial to the proper <hi rend="italic">forum criminis</hi>
                                    was unquestioned, as it resulted from the very nature of the
                                    universal and common dominion of the Roman laws.</p>
                                <p>And, at a later period, considerations of humanity, such as are
                                    now invoked to sanction the secret arrest and informal surrender
                                    of Colonel Arguelles, were held among the sovereigns of Europe
                                    to be legitimate grounds on which they might mutually ask and
                                    allow the remitter of alleged criminals. But in more modern
                                    times, since in the progress of civilization there has been a
                                    greater articulation in the powers of government, so that “the
                                    government” is no longer embodied in the person of the Executive
                                    alone, there has been a corresponding change in the principles
                                    and usages regulating the surrender of criminals escaping from
                                    one country into another. Criminals and still surrendered by <hi
                                        rend="italic">the sovereign authority</hi> of each country,
                                    but as in free and constitutional governments this sovereign
                                    authority no longer resides in the person of the Executive
                                    alone, the machinery for their legal surrender has come to
                                    partake of the complexity resulting from the partition of powers
                                    in such governments. In this country, for instance, the
                                    Executive is only a part of “the government,” and, as such, has
                                    no plenary power by virtue of which to assume a discretionary
                                    jurisdiction in regard to any subject-matter as to which such
                                    discretion has been expressly precluded by the letter of the law
                                    whose minister he is.</p>
                                <p>We shall proceed to show that the matter and manner of the
                                    extradition of alleged fugitives from justice are so regulated
                                    by general principles of modern international law, and by
                                    express statutes of our national legislature, as to deprive the
                                    Executive of all original and independent authority in the
                                    premises. Any assumption of such authority is not only without
                                    law, but is in direct contravention of both public and municipal
                                    law.</p>
                                <p>The legal traditions of our government on this subject are
                                    ancient, uniform, and undisputed. As early as 1792, Mr.
                                    Jefferson, while Secretary of State under President Washington,
                                    authorized our ministers at the court of Spain, Messrs. Wm.
                                    Carmichael and Wm. Short, to negotiate a treaty with that power
                                        <pb facs="0099" n="75" xml:id="pg_75"/> for the mutual
                                    delivery of persons charged with the crime of murder. (See
                                    American State Papers, Foreign Relations, p. 257.) It was
                                    stipulated in the project of the convention then proposed by Mr.
                                    Jefferson that the person authorized by the Spanish government
                                    to pursue the alleged murderer in the United States should apply
                                    to “any justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, or to
                                    the district judge of the place where the fugitive is, and
                                    should exhibit proof, on oath, that a murder had been committed
                                    by the said fugitive within the territory of the said
                                    government.” The judge was thereupon to be empowered to issue a
                                    warrant for the arrest of the fugitive, and “a special court of
                                    inquiry” was to be held, and a grand jury summoned thereto,
                                    charged with the duty of inquiring whether the fugitive had
                                    committed the crime of murder; and, on the finding of a true
                                    bill, the judge was to order a surrender of the fugitive to the
                                    Spanish government. In the memoranda accompaning this project of
                                    the convention Mr. Jefferson gives his reason why the government
                                    of the United States at that date was unwilling to provide for
                                    the delivery of others than persons charged with the crime of
                                    murder. And this delivery, it is seen, was to be surrounded with
                                    all the guards of a preliminary judicial inquiry. It is needless
                                    to add that no such convention as he projected was ever formed
                                    between our government and that of Spain on this subject, and we
                                    have adverted to it only for the sake of ascertaining at the
                                    threshold of this inquiry the principles on which the
                                    extradition of alleged criminals was based by our
                                    government.</p>
                                <p>In the 27th article of the treaty negotiated by John Jay with the
                                    government of Great Britain in the year 1794, the same
                                    principles were solemnly recognized. The article reads as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“It is further agreed that his Majesty and the United States, on
                                    mutual requisitions by them respectively, or by their respective
                                    ministers, or officers authorized to make the same, will deliver
                                    up to justice all persons who, being charged with murder or
                                    forgery committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek
                                    an asylum within any of the countries of the other: <hi
                                        rend="italic">Provided,</hi> That this shall only be done on
                                    such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the
                                    place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,
                                    would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the
                                    offence had there been committed. The The expense of such
                                    apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by those
                                    who make the requisition and receive the fugitive.”</p>
                                <p>Under this article of Jay’s treaty, one Thomas Nash, alias
                                    Jonathan Robbins, was delivered to the British authorities by
                                    Judge Thomas Bee, district judge of the United States, in the
                                    year 1799. The transaction caused much excitement at the time,
                                    as Nash represented himself to be a native-born citizen of
                                    Connecticut, and the case has been frequently reviewed in
                                    Congress and in the public press of the country. The
                                    correspondence and proceedings had in the case may be seen in
                                    the “American State Papers, Foreign Relations,” vol. 2, pp. 284,
                                    285.</p>
                                <p>In the year 1797, one William Jones, a Spanish subject residing
                                    in the State of Georgia, and owning slaves therein, went into
                                    Florida, then belonging to Spain, and, with the aid of some
                                    citizens of Georgia, forcibly abducted certain of his slaves who
                                    had fled into that province. This invasion and violation of the
                                    sovereign territorial rights of Spain naturally irritated the
                                    government of that country, which made strong representations on
                                    the subject to President Washington; and the question, whether
                                    it would be right to deliver up this criminal for punishment,
                                    having been referred to the Attorney General of the United
                                    States, the Honorable Charles Lee, that officer held that,
                                    though the case was an aggravated one, the Executive had no
                                    power to surrender Jones in the absence of a law regulating and
                                    authorizing such surrender. He held:</p>
                                <p>“If a demand were formally made that William Jones, a subject and
                                    fugitive from justice, or any of our own citizens, heinous
                                    offenders within the dominion of Spain, should be delivered to
                                    their government for trial and punishment, the United States are
                                    in duty bound to comply; yet, having omitted to make a law
                                    directing the mode of proceeding, I know not how, according to
                                    the present system, a delivery of such offender could be
                                    effected. To refuse or neglect to comply with such a demand,
                                    may, under certain circumstances, afford to <pb facs="0100"

                                    able to take and deliver up the offenders to them. This defect
                                    appears to me to require a particular law.”</p>
                                <p>In the year 1821 Daniel Sullivan, a British subject and master of
                                    a British schooner, aided by six accomplices, likewise British
                                    subjects, ran away with the vessel into a port of the State of
                                    Maine, where she was seized by an officer for having entered in
                                    violation of our laws. The British government thereupon demanded
                                    that the vessel and cargo should be restored to their lawful
                                    owner, and that the British subjects who had committed the
                                    offence in question should be delivered up for trial. On this
                                    state of facts Mr. Attorney General Wirt, in a most able and
                                    elaborate opinion, held that the ship and cargo should be
                                    restored, but that, in the absence of treaty stipulations and
                                    municipal regulations, there was no power in the President to
                                    surrender the alleged conspirators who had run away with the
                                    schooner. He wrote, (1 Opinions of Attorneys General, pp.
                                    519-521)—</p>
                                <p>“The truth seems to be, that this duty to deliver up criminals is
                                    so vague and uncertain as to the offences on which it rests, is
                                    of so imperfect a nature as an obligation, is so inconveniently
                                    encumbered in practice by the requisition that the party
                                    demanded shall have been convicted on full and judicial proof,
                                    or such proof as may be called for by the nation on whom the
                                    demand is made, and the usage to deliver or to refuse being
                                    perfectly at the option of each nation, has been so various, and
                                    consequently so uncertain in its action, that these causes
                                    combined have led to the practice of providing by treaty for <hi

                                <p>“In our treaty of 1794 with Great Britain, the 27th article
                                    provided for the cases in which the contracting parties agreed
                                    to bind themselves to surrender criminals, and the degree of
                                    proof which should be sufficient to impose the obligation to
                                    surrender. The two cases were <hi rend="italic">murder and
                                        forgery,</hi> and the proof such as should be sufficient to
                                    justify an arrest according to the laws of the country in which
                                    the demand was made. This article was, by the terms of the
                                    treaty, to continue in force for twelve years only; that is to
                                    say, the parties agreed to remain bound to this mutual surrender
                                    of criminals in the two specified cases for twelve years and no
                                    longer. The twelve years have expired; and with them, in my
                                    opinion, has expired the right to make the demand even in the
                                    specified cases.” * * * *</p>
                                <p>“Upon the whole, I am of the opinion that there is nothing in the
                                    law of nations, as explained by the usage and practice of the
                                    most respectable among them, which imposes on us any obligation
                                    to deliver up these persons; more especially on the very
                                    imperfect proof of their guilt, or rather the total absence of
                                    everything like judicial proof, on which the application is
                                    founded. And this conclusion, drawn from an examination of the
                                    general law and usage of nations, derives confirmation in the
                                    particular case from the expired article of the treaty with
                                    Great Britain, to which I have adverted.</p>
                                <p>“I am further of the opinion, that even if, by the laws and usage
                                    of nations, the obligation existed, and were a perfect
                                    obligation, and the proof which is offered of the guilt of the
                                    accused also satisfied the requisitions of that law, <hi
                                        rend="italic">still the President has no power to make the
                                        delivery. The Constitution, and the treaties and acts of
                                        Congress made under its authority, comprise the whole of the
                                        President’s powers. Neither of these contains any provision
                                        on this subject. He has no power to arrest any one, except
                                        for the violation of our own laws.</hi> A treaty or an act
                                    of Congress might clothe him with the power to arrest and
                                    deliver up fugitive criminals from abroad; and it is perhaps to
                                    be desired that such a power existed, to be exercised or not at
                                    his discretion; for, although not <hi rend="italic">bound</hi>
                                    to deliver up such persons, it might very often be <hi
                                        rend="italic">expedient</hi> to do it. There could certainly
                                    be no objection to the exercise of such power in a case like the
                                    present. It would violate no claim which these fugitives have on
                                    us.”</p>
                                <p>In the year 1831 Attorney General Taney, the present Chief
                                    Justice, was called to express an opinion whether the President
                                    of the United States could return to Holland for trial a person
                                    alleged to have stolen some diamonds of the Princes of Orange.
                                    He gave it as his opinion that, in the absence of a treaty
                                    stipulation, the President “would not be justified in directing
                                    the surrender of the persons.” (2 Opinions of Attorneys General,
                                    p. 452.)</p>
                                <p>To the same effect Attorney General Taney wrote as follows, it
                                    was alleged, under date of April 16, 1833, in respect to an
                                    application of the King of Portugal for the delivery of two
                                    seamen who had committed the crime of piracy— 2 Opinions of
                                    Attorneys General, p. 559:)</p>

                                <p>“There is no law of Congress which authorizes the President to
                                    deliver up any one found in the United States who is charged
                                    with having committed a crime against a foreign nation; and we
                                    have no treaty stipulations with Portugal for the delivery of
                                    offenders. In such a state of things it has always been held
                                    that the President possesses no authority to deliver up the
                                    offender.”</p>
                                <p>In the year 1841, while Mr. Seward, the present Secretary of
                                    State, was governor of the State of New York, he addressed a
                                    communication to Daniel Webster, then Secretary of State under
                                    President Tyler, inquiring whether it was lawful for him, as
                                    governor of New York, to surrender one Dewit, a fugitive from
                                    justice, demanded of him by the governor general of Canada. The
                                    question being referred by Mr. Webster to the office of the
                                    Attorney General, Mr. Legard held as follows—(3 Opinions of
                                    Attorneys General, p. 661:)</p>
                                <p>“I think, from the whole argument of the bench in the case of
                                    Holmes <hi rend="italic">vs.</hi> Jennison, 14 Peters, 540, we
                                    may consider it as law, first, that no State can, without the
                                    consent of Congress, enter into any agreement or compact,
                                    express or implied, to deliver up fugitives from justice from a
                                    foreign state who may be found within its limits; second, that
                                    according to the practice of the executive department, as
                                    appears from the official correspondence both of Mr. Jefferson

                                    its wisdom the propriety of passing an act to authorize such of
                                    the States as may choose to make arrangements with the
                                    government of Canada, or any other foreign state, for the mutual

                                <p>In the year 1853, Mr. Attorney General Caleb Gushing reaffirmed
                                    the doctrine of our government on the subject. He wrote under
                                    date of August 19, in that year—(6 Opinions of Attorneys
                                    General, p. 86:)</p>
                                <p>“It is the settled political doctrine of the United States, that,
                                    independently of special compact, no State is bound to deliver
                                    up fugitives from the justice of another State. (See the
                                    authorities collected in Wheaton’s Elements, p. 172.)</p>
                                <p>“It is true, any State may, in its discretion, do this as a
                                    matter of international comity towards the foreign state; but
                                    all such discretion is of inconvenient exercise in a
                                    constitutional republic, organized as is the federal Union; and
                                    accordingly it is the received policy of this government to
                                    refuse to grant extradition except in virtue of express
                                    stipulations to that effect.”</p>
                                <p>It will thus be seen that the line of legal tradition on this
                                    subject in our country is as unbroken as it is express. And if
                                    we turn to the institutes of the law as held in Great Britain,
                                    we shall find that the same maxims obtain. We need but refer to
                                    a single occasion when they were formally enunciated in the
                                    British Parliament with all the authority attaching to the
                                    highest law officer of the realm, and the occasion was one which
                                    makes these declarations especially interesting to American
                                    readers.</p>
                                <p>The ship Creole was sailing with a cargo of one hundred and
                                    thirty-eight slaves from one slaveholding port of the United
                                    States to another slaveholding port. In the course of the voyage
                                    the slaves rose upon the captain and crew, seized the vessel,
                                    and took her into the port of Nassau, in the Bahamas. In the act
                                    of her seizure by the slaves a scuffle occurred, in which the
                                    master of the slaves was killed. Upon their arrival in the
                                    Bahamas one hundred and twenty of the slaves were landed and
                                    liberated, and the remaining eighteen, engaged in the capture of
                                    the vessel, were taken into custody on the charge partly of
                                    murder and partly of piracy.</p>
                                <p>The question therefore arose, whether these slaves could be
                                    lawfully held in custody by the British authorities in the
                                    Bahamas for the crime thus alleged against them; and whether, in
                                    answer to a demand of the government of the United States, they
                                    could be rightfully given up for trial in this country. Upon <pb

                                    Brougham held the following language in the House of Lords on
                                    the 3d of February, 1842:</p>
                                <p>“He ventured to state, that, by the law of this country, no
                                    person, whether he were a British subject returning from abroad,
                                    or an alien coming to our shores, no person charged with having
                                    committed an offence out of the jurisdiction of Great Britain
                                    could be seized, or detained, or given up to any foreign
                                    government whatever, which might demand to have him given up, in
                                    respect to the offence with which he was charged. For example,
                                    if an Englishman in France were to commit a felony—say even a
                                    murder—and return to this country, or if a Frenchman in France
                                    were to commit a murder and escape to this country, the French
                                    government might in vain demand of the English government to
                                    have the alleged murderer given up for the purpose of being
                                    tried for his offence in France. There had at different times,
                                    no doubt, been treaties between this country and France, and at
                                    one time there was a treaty between this country and the United
                                    States of America, for the mutual surrender by each government,
                                    on the requisition of the other, of persons charged (according
                                    to the American treaty of 1795) with the two offences of murder
                                    and forgery; and (according to the treaty of 1802 with France)
                                    of persons charged with the three offences of murder, forgery,
                                    and fraudulent bankruptcy. But before those treaties could be
                                    carried into effect in this country it was necessary to pass
                                    especial acts of Parliament, to enable the government to perform
                                    the obligation which it had incurred by the treaties; and
                                    accordingly the 37th George 3d gave the powers required for
                                    executing the treaty with America, and the 42d George 3d,
                                    commonly called the alien act, not satisfied with the general
                                    powers of the alien act, had a clause referring to the French
                                    treaty, and arming the government with the power to arrest,
                                    detain, and surrender parties. He hoped that their lordships
                                    would excuse his entering into these particulars, on account of
                                    the great importance of the question. There was no lawyer who
                                    could entertain any doubt upon the subject. It was clear that
                                    the surrender of any of the slaves, or even of any of the
                                    persons charged with the felony, the alleged murder having been
                                    committed beyond the territory of Great Britain, would be
                                    utterly without warrant, and, by the law of this country, could
                                    not possibly be accomplished, even if the government were
                                    disposed to do it. A doubt may possibly arise as to whether the
                                    act committed on board the Creole might not be piracy. The facts
                                    as stated did not appear to constitute piracy. If there were any
                                    who considered that a doubtful or debatable point, then he
                                    apprehended that the true course of proceeding would be to put
                                    the matter into a course of investigation—to have a judicial
                                    inquiry, so that all the facts and circumstances might be fully
                                    ascertained, and that the legal import of those facts might be
                                    determined. But even if the circumstances connected with the
                                    seizure of the Creole amounted to piracy, it did not follow that
                                    those who had been guilty of it should be given up by the
                                    government of England to the government of any other country. If
                                    the facts amounted to piracy the parties, though aliens, were
                                    triable in our courts. If any doubt lingered in his mind, it was
                                    as to the right of delivering up aliens charged with piracy; and
                                    if any persons held that such a power of surrender existed, the
                                    question might be put in a course of judicial investigation. He
                                    would fain hope that this accidental occurrence of the capture
                                    and bringing into port of the Creole, when rightly understood in
                                    America, would have no effect in delaying the successful
                                    accomplishment of that most important mission upon which his
                                    noble friend opposite (Lord Ashburton) was about to
                                    proceed—greatly to the advantage of the negotiations, greatly to
                                    the benefit of the two countries, which had a high and an equal
                                    interest in perpetuating the friendly relations so essential to
                                    the prosperity of both, and greatly to his own honor, in having
                                    undertaken, in the circumstances of the case, this most
                                    important service.”</p>
                                <p>On the 14th of the same month Lord Brougham referred to the
                                    subject in the following terms. We quote from Hansard’s Report
                                    of the Parliamentary Debates, volume 60 of the third series:</p>
                                <p>“What right existed, under the municipal law of this country, to
                                    seize and deliver up criminals taking refuge there? What right
                                    had the government to detain, still less to deliver them up?
                                    Whatever right one nation had against another nation—even by
                                    treaty, which would give the strongest right—there was, by the
                                    municipal law of the nation, no power to execute the obligation
                                    of the treaty. If such a treaty existed between any two
                                    countries, say between America and this country, and no act of
                                    Parliament had passed enabling the government in either country
                                    to perform its conditions, that treaty became utterly
                                    unavailable, because the law of the land prevented the
                                    possibility of its being executed. Suppose it was clear, and no
                                    doubt existed that a treaty were in force binding on the two
                                    parties, (and such an obligation would be much more clear than
                                    any that could be pretended under the general law of nations,
                                    the common international law,) and suppose either party had
                                    omitted to take power from its own legislature to carry the
                                    treaty into execution, the mere existence of the treaty would
                                    not enable that power to carry the treaty into effect. The
                                    treaty would be a dead letter if the municipal law of that
                                    country did not authorize the fulfilment of its provisions. It
                                    was necessary to say so much, because he thought some of those
                                    who had argued the subject, particularly in America, had not
                                    kept the two questions of international <pb facs="0103" n="79"
                                        xml:id="pg_79"/> law and of municipal law sufficiently
                                    apart. It was necessary that a municipal law for detaining and
                                    giving up criminals should exist, as well as the law of nations.
                                    Such a municipal law did not exist in this country. There was no
                                    power by our municipal law to seize, still less to surrender,
                                    any person having committed an offence, however grave that
                                    offence might be, within the jurisdiction or limits of any other
                                    country; whether he were an alien or not, there was no power to
                                    give him up until the legislature of this country should arm the
                                    government with a power to do so. He had on the first night of
                                    the session referred to two cases, the acts of 1797 and 1802,
                                    passed for the purpose of arming the government with the power
                                    of performing their obligations contracted by Mr. Jay’s treaty
                                    and the treaty of Amiens, and without which acts it would have
                                    been impossible to have performed those obligations. He had
                                    stated that the only doubt in his mind with regard to the case
                                    of the Creole arose from the suggestion that a piratical offence
                                    had been committed. No doubt the case of piracy was in two
                                    particulars different from the general law respecting charges
                                    against aliens for crimes committed beyond the jurisdiction of
                                    the country; for whereas in any other case they had no power to
                                    seize or detain, yet in a case of piracy, although the party was
                                    an alien, they had power to seize and detain. That was one
                                    particular in which a difference existed; but another particular
                                    was the power of trying the alien pirate, and therefore he had
                                    no doubt that, even in the case of piracy, we had not, and ought
                                    not to have, the power to deliver up, because where the offence
                                    was piracy we had not only the power of seizing and detaining
                                    the person, but we could send him to his trial; so that here was
                                    no deficient jurisdiction, and no fear that the criminal would
                                    go unpunished, whilst in the case of a murder alleged to have
                                    been committed by an alien in a foreign country there was no
                                    power either of arresting or of bringing him to trial. It was
                                    impossible to deny, and he did not deny, that this was a state
                                    of law which ought not to continue. He thought it highly
                                    expedient—he thought the interests of justice required, and the
                                    rights of good neighborhood required—that in two countries
                                    bordering on one another, as the United States, Canada, and even
                                    that in England and in the European countries of France, Holland
                                    and Belgium, there ought to be laws on both sides giving power,
                                    under due regulations and safeguards, to each government to
                                    secure persons who have committed offences in the territory of
                                    one and taken refuge in the territory of the other. He could
                                    hardly imagine how nations could maintain the relationship which
                                    ought to exist between one civilized country and another without
                                    some such power; at present, however, such a power did not exist
                                    in this country; so that the whole territory of one country
                                    became an asylum for fugitives from justice in another. But as
                                    to the laws now in force there could be no doubt. Such a
                                    proceeding as seizing and detaining, much more of delivering up
                                    fugitives, was wholly illegal.”</p>
                                <p>The Earl of Aberdeen, who was then the British secretary of state
                                    for foreign affairs, expressed his concurrence in the views of
                                    Lord Brougham as follows:</p>
                                <p>“As their lordships might well imagine, her Majesty’s government
                                    had given the question their most serious and anxious attention;
                                    and after taking advantage of all the assistance which they
                                    thought desirable on the subject, they had satisfied themselves
                                    that by the laws of this country there is no machinery or
                                    authority for bringing those persons to trial for mutiny and
                                    murder, still less for delivering them up or detaining them in
                                    custody. His noble friend, the secretary of state for the
                                    colonial department, had therefore sent out instructions for
                                    releasing those persons who had hitherto been detained.”</p>
                                <p>Lord Denman, the lord chief justice of England at the same time,
                                    spoke as follows:</p>
                                <p>“He believed that all Westminster Hall, including the judicial
                                    bench, were unanimous in holding the opinion expressed by the
                                    noble earl, and that in this country there was no right of
                                    delivering up, indeed no means of securing, persons accused of
                                    crimes committed in foreign countries. The matter was under
                                    discussion frequently when the alien bill had been year after
                                    year before the House of Commons, and the lawyers of all parties
                                    had come to the same conclusion.</p>
                                <p>“Nor were these opinions confined to the lawyers of Europe. Great
                                    lawyers of America— men distinguished by their profound
                                    erudition, whose decisions are so highly respected among us, and
                                    whose valuable works on great legal questions are studied and
                                    consulted in this country with the highest advantage—held the
                                    same doctrine. Indeed, Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries on
                                    American Law, (1836,) appears to incline to the opinion of
                                    Grotius and Vattel, against that of other eminent jurists, that
                                    persons accused of crimes ought to be delivered up to the
                                    country where they are accused, and one case appears to have
                                    been decided by himself when he held his office in conformity
                                    with that doctrine. But it may be remarked that the peculiar
                                    constitution of a federal government, comprehending many States
                                    with various laws, renders any decision, however respectable, of
                                    less extensive application, at least till all the particular
                                    provisions existing when it was made are fully canvassed. But
                                    Justice Story, in his more recent edition of The Conflict of
                                    Laws, (1841,) concludes a discussion on this subject by citing
                                    the passage from Lord Coke, adding, in terms, one chief <pb

                                    adhered to the same doctrine in a very elaborate judgment; that
                                    the reasoning of another chief justice, in a leading case, leads
                                    to the same conclusion; and that it stands indirectly confirmed
                                    by a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United
                                    States in a very recent case of the deepest interest.</p>
                                <p>“Therefore, although distinguished jurists may feel a desire for
                                    some arrangement for the surrender of foreign criminals, it
                                    would seem that the municipal law of America rests on the same
                                    principles as our own, which, as he had already stated,
                                    recognized no right and provided no machinery by which the
                                    subjects of another state seeking refuge here could be given up
                                    to the country to which they belonged. He had, therefore, come
                                    prepared respectfully to warn secretaries of state, if it had
                                    not been rendered unnecessary by what had passed, that they
                                    could not seize or detain aliens seeking refuge here without
                                    subjecting themselves to actions for damages for false
                                    imprisonment, and without further incurring the risk of a, still
                                    heavier and more awful responsibility; for if a man attempted to
                                    seize an alien under such authority he might resist, and if
                                    death ensued, he would be justified in inflicting it, while
                                    those who ordered his arrest and detention would be liable to be
                                    tried for murder. He agreed with his noble and learned friend
                                    that the <hi rend="italic">comity</hi> of nations might be
                                    properly employed in considering of treaties and laws which
                                    would allow nations to seize and give up to each other their
                                    respective criminals; but this could only be done on the
                                    supposition that the laws of all nations should be reasonable
                                    and just, for no country could be justified in enforcing those
                                    laws which it believed to be founded on injustice, oppression,
                                    and cruelty. Some few great criminals had possibly been given up
                                    without notice; but he believed that the United States of
                                    America had refused to give up an English subject charged with
                                    forgery, because they disapproved of the punishment of death for
                                    that crime; and until the internal law of all countries was such
                                    that each would have no objection to adopt it, he feared that
                                    this desirable object could not be accomplished. He indulged a
                                    hope that those distinguished persons, the judges and jurists in
                                    America, who had been referred to, would in common with those of
                                    other countries, apply their minds to these considerations.”</p>
                                <p>Lord Campbell held the following language on the subject:</p>
                                <p>“He said that after the statement of their opinions by his two
                                    noble and learned friends, he should not have felt it necessary
                                    to address their lordships if it had not been asserted, and
                                    widely circulated, that he had, when attorney general, advised
                                    that men similarly circumstanced should be sent home for trial.
                                    Nothing could be more contrary to the fact than such a
                                    statement. He had never given any opinion of the kind. On the
                                    contrary, he had held that, by the law of nations, no state had
                                    a right to demand from another the surrender of any of its
                                    subjects; and that in the case of England, the municipal law did
                                    not authorize or enable the executive to comply with any such
                                    demand. He agreed with the lord chief justice that it might be
                                    very convenient to have treaties under which persons accused of
                                    murder and other high crimes should be surrendered, but such
                                    treaties would not justify the demand being acted on until the
                                    municipal law provides the means for carrying the treaties into
                                    execution. Without an act of Parliament there was no authority
                                    for giving up a refugee to any foreign state.”</p>
                                <p>The Lord Chancellor spoke as follows at the close of the
                                    debate:</p>
                                <p>“He apprehended that he was the only law lord in the house who
                                    had not yet given his opinion. He had been consulted upon the
                                    question, as well as the attorney and solicitor general, and
                                    without pretending to state the terms in which their opinion had
                                    been given, he might say that it fully agreed with what had been
                                    advanced by noble and learned lords who had already spoken. He
                                    did not think that a second opinion could be entertained.”</p>
                                <p>It will thus be seen that, according to the universally received
                                    maxims of law as held in the United States and Great Britain,
                                    the executive authority is not authorized, in the absence of
                                    treaty stipulations and of municipal legislation carrying them
                                    into effect, to arrest and deliver up fugitives from justice.
                                    Hence the origin and purpose of the 10th article in the treaty
                                    of Washington, negotiated between the United States and Great
                                    Britain, in the year 1842, by Mr. “Webster and Lord Ashburton,
                                    providing for the extradition of persons charged with certain
                                    specified crimes. The treaty, under this head, ordained that
                                    “the respective judges and other magistrates of the two
                                    governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon
                                    complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the
                                    apprehension of the fugitive, that he may be brought before such
                                    judges or other magistrates to the end <hi rend="italic">that
                                        the evidence</hi> of criminality may be heard and
                                    considered; and if, on such hearing, <hi rend="italic">the
                                        evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge,</hi> it
                                    shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to
                                    certify the same to the proper executive authority, that a
                                    warrant may issue for the surrender of such fugitive.”</p>
                                <pb facs="0105" n="81" xml:id="pg_81"/>
                                <p>The treaty, it will be seen, contemplated a judicial inquiry
                                    preliminary to every act of surrender. And an act of Parliament
                                    was passed in the year 1843, (6 and 7 Victoria, chap. 76,) to
                                    carry this part of the treaty into effect. How important, we
                                    should say how <hi rend="italic">indispensable,</hi> such
                                    municipal legislation is to effectuate stipulations for the
                                    extradition of fugitives from justice, was illustrated by a
                                    notable case in our judicial records, a case which led to the
                                    enactment of corresponding laws in our own country for the
                                    regulation of this whole matter as covered by treaty
                                    engagements, and extending the exercise of such authority in all
                                    cases not covered by treaty.</p>
                                <p>An extradition treaty was concluded between the United States and
                                    France in the year 1843. Under this treaty, in the year 1847,
                                    the French minister to this country demanded the arrest and
                                    surrender of one Nicholas Lucien Metzger, and a mandate to that
                                    effect was issued from the State Department, signed by President
                                    Polk, and countersigned by Mr. Buchanan, as Secretary of State.
                                    The fugitive was arrested, and while on his way to a French
                                    frigate then lying in the harbor of New York, a writ of <hi
                                        rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> was sued out, returnable
                                    before Edmonds, circuit judge. The case was twice elaborately
                                    argued before the judge by the honorable B. F. Butler, United
                                    States district attorney for the government, and with him were
                                    associated Mr. F. B. Cutting and Mr. F. Tillou, as counsel for
                                    the French minister, and by Mr. Ogden Hoffman and Mr. N. B.
                                    Blunt for the prisoner. The prisoner was discharged, and mainly
                                    on the ground that, being a resident of this State, he was a
                                    “member” of it within the meaning of our Constitution; that, as
                                    such, <hi rend="italic">he could not be deprived of his liberty
                                        without a resort to courts of justice;</hi> that, though the
                                    treaty with France contained an extradition clause, yet <hi
                                        rend="italic">Congress had never passed a law authorizing
                                        the courts to enforce it,</hi> and as without such law the
                                    courts could have no jurisdiction in the matter, there could be
                                    no judicial determination of the question of arrest and
                                    surrender; that such determination could not be made by the
                                    executive department alone, and that therefore the mandate of
                                    the President was void.</p>
                                <p>The prisoner was accordingly ordered by Judge Edmonds to be
                                    discharged. The French minister was much dissatisfied with the
                                    result—so much so that our government directed a writ of error
                                    to be brought, in order to take the case to the Supreme Court of
                                    the United States. At the ensuing session of Congress the
                                    subject was laid before the Senate, by whom it was referred to
                                    the Judiciary Committee, on which were Daniel Webster, Robert J.
                                    Walker, and Wm. L. Dayton, our present minister to France. Their
                                    examination convinced them that the decision was right; the writ
                                    of error was abandoned, and Congress passed a law supplying the
                                    defect complained of, and providing for the action of the
                                    judiciary in such cases. That law was as follows:</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
                                        Representatives of the United States of America in Congress

                                    State, district, or territory with having committed within the
                                    jurisdiction of any such foreign government any of the crimes
                                    enumerated or provided for by any such treaty or convention, to
                                    issue his warrant for the apprehension of the person so charged,
                                    that he may be brought before such judge or commissioner, to the

                                    considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed
                                    sufficient by him to sustain the charge under the provisions of
                                    the proper treaty or convention, it shall be his duty to certify
                                    the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before

                                <p>In the light of this historical review, and especially in the
                                    immediate presence of the statute of our Congress, we can
                                    clearly read this law and usage of the United States on this
                                    subject. To compass the extradition of a fugitive from justice
                                    there must be a treaty stipulation, enforced by corresponding
                                    municipal legislation; and it is expressly declared by the
                                    Congress, in the 5th section of the above-cited act, that such
                                    municipal legislation taken shall “continue in force only during
                                    the existence of any treaty of extradition with any foreign
                                    government.” If, even under a treaty of extradition, a criminal
                                    cannot be given up without the co-operation of our statutes,
                                    what shall be said of the arrest and surrender of a criminal
                                    without the authority either of treaty stipulation or of
                                    municipal law?</p>
                                <p>We have seen that the Cuban authorities and the minister of Spain
                                    did not ask the delivery of Arguelles as a matter of right, but
                                    only as a matter of grace, in the interest of humanity. It may
                                    be interesting to know how far the government of Spain was
                                    entitled to expect that our government would act on this
                                    principle, even supposing it had the right to do so.</p>
                                <p>A recent transaction between the two governments, recorded in the
                                    diplomatic correspondence of Mr. Seward, as transmitted to
                                    Congress at the opening of the present session, affords an
                                    illustration of the principles and precedents which have been
                                    heretofore understood to govern the right of asylum and the
                                    conditions on which the extradition of alleged criminals may be
                                    claimed by one government and granted by another. As this case
                                    was fresh in the minds of the Spanish authorities when they
                                    reclaimed Colonel Arguelles, and in the memory of the
                                    administration when it yielded to their request, we may recite
                                    the circumstances under which it arose, using for this purpose
                                    the words of the government when giving an account of the
                                    transaction—(Papers relating to Foreign Affairs, 1863, vol. 2,
                                    p. 994:)</p>
                                <p>“In the month of September, 1862, the city of New Orleans had
                                    been reclaimed by the naval and military forces of the United
                                    States from insurrectionary occupation, and was then held as a
                                    military position, in an actual state of civil war. The blockade
                                    regulations of the port were relaxed so far as to admit trade
                                    under military regulations. Three Spanish vessels-of-war, in
                                    conformity with the liberal practice which the United States had
                                    adopted towards all the maritime powers, were admitted into the
                                    port of New Orleans without question. The city was then in a
                                    condition of great distress, and permission was freely given by
                                    the authorities of the United States to any foreign government
                                    which should ask it, to receive and remove any of their
                                    suffering countrymen who were not compromitted in the
                                    insurrection. A number of such persons went on board of the
                                    three Spanish vessels with passes from the military authorities,
                                    such passes being given to all unoffending persons who applied
                                    for them. The commander of the Blasco de Garay, being also in
                                    command of the other two vessels, not content with giving
                                    passages to persons of the class before mentioned, went further,
                                    and knowingly and without consulting with the military commander
                                    of the port, received on board and conveyed away eighty native
                                    citizens of the United States who had been compromised in the
                                    insurrection, and this in violation of known and well-understood
                                    military regulations, which forbade any person without a pass to
                                    leave the city. On the 25th day of October the major general
                                    commanding called the attention of the captain of the Blasco de
                                    Garay to this subject, and then asked to be informed of the
                                    names of the passengers, not belonging to the government service
                                    of Spain, whom he had taken in his ship, on the voyage before
                                    mentioned, to Havana, and especially to state whether one Mr.
                                    Roberts, of New Orleans, was a passenger. <hi rend="italic">The
                                        commander of the Blasco de Garay declined to comply with
                                        this request.”</hi></p>
                                <p>The case as thus represented was at this stage submitted by Mr.
                                    Seward to the government of Spain, with an expression of the
                                    hope that it would receive “the prompt attention of her Catholic
                                    Majesty’s minister at Washington.” Thus addressed on the
                                    subject, M. Tassara, the Spanish minister, referred the matter
                                    to the government of her Catholic Majesty at Madrid, requesting
                                    at the same time reports from the captain general of Cuba and
                                    from the Spanish consul at New Orleans. The decision of the
                                    Spanish government in the premises <pb facs="0107" n="83"
                                        xml:id="pg_83"/> was announced by the Marquis de Miraflores,
                                    the present minister of state in Spain, as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The right to give asylum to political refugees is in such manner
                                    rooted in the habits, in such sort interwoven with the ideas of
                                    tolerance of the present century, and has such frequent generous
                                    and beneficent applications in the extraordinary and ensanguined
                                    political contests of the times we live in, that there is no
                                    nation in the world which dares to deny this right, and,
                                    moreover, not any one that can renounce its exercise. What would
                                    become of the most eminent men of our days if, in the political
                                    tempests in which success may be against them, they could not
                                    protect themselves beneath the inviolable mantle of foreign
                                    hospitality, offering to them haply a friendly country, where
                                    they may breathe tranquil and safe; haply a shelter whose
                                    thresholds their pursuers cannot overstep, or haply, in fine,
                                    the shadow of a national flag floating in a port? In such cases
                                    it can be said that the flag which shields them is not merely
                                    the ensign of a foreign nation, but rather the banner of
                                    humanity and civilization, under whose ample folds all those can
                                    be received who are pursued because they are enemies, rather
                                    than because they are criminals. We are empowered, therefore,
                                    and we ought to give asylum on board our vessels-of-war in the
                                    United States to political refugees. <hi rend="italic">The
                                        limitation of asylum lies in the offence. Asylum ought not
                                        to serve to give impunity to those guilty of ordinary
                                        crimes;</hi> that would be to encourage crime, and no
                                    civilized nation may do that. But it may be said that it is not
                                    easy for the commander of a ship-of-war to know whether the man
                                    who presents himself on board, asking for asylum, is or not
                                    guilty of ordinary crimes. In such cases the commander should
                                    require his word of honor that he has not committed such
                                    offences. But should he give that, and afterwards turn out that
                                    he has lied, there could be no difficulty in handing over to the
                                    authorities a man who to former offences had added that of the
                                    abuse of good faith, in being wanting to his parole. <hi
                                        rend="italic">And if the government of Washington wishes to
                                        acquire a perfect and positive right to the delivery to them
                                        of those guilty of ordinary crimes, it will be enabled to do
                                        so by means of a treaty of extradition, to the conclusion of
                                        which the Spanish government would not oppose itself as it
                                        has not refused to conclude such with other
                                    states.”</hi></p>
                                <p>It will thus be seen that the Spanish government sustained the
                                    proceedings of the commander of the Blasco de Garay, who
                                    declined even to give the names of the passengers whom he had
                                    taken in his ship. Our government was simply informed that if it
                                    desired to reclaim ordinary criminals it could acquire “a
                                    perfect and positive right to do so” by concluding an
                                    extradition treaty, and that in the absence of such a treaty it
                                    would give no heed to our reclamations.</p>
                                <p>It remains for us, at the close of these historical citations, to
                                    sum up the logical conclusions suggested by the principles and
                                    precedents thus passed in review.</p>
                                <p>From the history we have given it appears that while the
                                    obligation of nations not to grant asylum to criminals, but to
                                    deliver them up for trial, receives the general assent of
                                    civilized nations, it is one subject to too many limitations and
                                    modifications. It is a duty of “imperfect obligation,” so
                                    called, like those interwoven with the private life of
                                    individuals, and the neglect of which destroys the reputation of
                                    the man without rendering him amenable for violating the law. It
                                    is a duty resting upon the conscience of the nation, to be
                                    discharged under such circumstances, in such cases, and in such
                                    manner, as in the judgment of the nation, expressed through the
                                    constituted authorities, may seem best adapted to subserve the
                                    cause of virtue and the interests of humanity.</p>
                                <p>In some political systems the monarch is the authority who at
                                    once determines the question and executes the judgment; but in
                                    those countries where the principles of constitutional
                                    government obtain—in other words, where the rights of the person
                                    are recognized—the maxims of law limit the otherwise absolute
                                    power of the executive authority, and in performing their
                                    obligations to the human race, the legislature, in such
                                    countries, is careful not to overlook their obligations to the
                                    individual. Thus in Great Britain, as we have seen, while the
                                    sovereign may make treaties, he cannot fulfil a treaty binding
                                    him to surrender fugitive criminals without the express sanction
                                    of that part of the government which is charged with the
                                    guardianship of the life and liberty of the individual. He may
                                    make war or conclude peace without the consent of Parliament;
                                    but without its consent he cannot deprive the humblest
                                    individual of liberty, though that individual be charged with
                                    the deepest crimes.</p>
                                <pb facs="0108" n="84" xml:id="pg_84"/>
                                <p>In our own political system we find the same careful process for
                                    reaching the ends of justice. The treaty-making power determines
                                    what offences the nation will lend its aid to punish, and into
                                    what hands it is willing to deliver offenders for punishment.
                                    The tenth article of the treaty of Washington, concluded between
                                    the United States and Great Britain on this subject, shows, by
                                    the catalogue of crimes it embraces, that we are willing to
                                    trust the enlightened criminal jurisprudence of England in a
                                    wider class of offences than we would remand to some other
                                    countries whose creeds are less conformed to the humane spirit
                                    of the age. When the treaty-making power has ascertained the
                                    extent of the obligation of surrender, and assumed the
                                    corresponding duty, the legislative power comes forward to
                                    provide for the fulfilment of that duty; and in so doing
                                    Congress has thought proper to omit none of those safeguards
                                    which have been found essential to protect the accused against
                                    baseless charges, and which, necessary as they are in cases
                                    where the accused is to be tried in the jurisdiction where he is
                                    found, are doubly and trebly necessary where the charges are put
                                    forward, not for trial here, but as the means of obtaining
                                    possession of the accused and carrying him abroad.</p>
                                <p>It is not improbable that factitious accusations should be
                                    brought for the mere purpose of procuring the arrest and
                                    surrender of a fugitive. Hence it is that the careful provisions
                                    of the statute, regulating extradition in this country, commit
                                    to the judiciary—versed as that department already is in all the
                                    proceedings preparatory to a trial—the duty of arresting the
                                    fugitive and of ascertaining whether in fact a crime has been
                                    committed, and whether there is sufficient evidence to hold the
                                    accused for trial. When these questions have been settled by the
                                    judiciary, and not till then, does the nation consent to deny
                                    the right of asylum to the fugitive who has sought its
                                    protection and deliver him into the hands of the alien
                                    prosecutor.</p>
                                <p>It is needless to add that in the case of Arguelles the Executive
                                    has assumed all the authority which by the Constitution is
                                    distributed among the treaty-making power, the law-making power,
                                    and the judiciary. Without treaty, without law, and without
                                    judicial action, the Executive has assumed to do what only all
                                    three combined could lawfully empower him to do.</p>
                                <p>And in making this statement as a proposition of law, we indulge
                                    in no personal crimination of the President’s motives. As he
                                    makes no legal defence of his conduct, but bases that defence on
                                    his good intentions, we make all due allowance for such good
                                    intentions while bringing his proceedings to the bar of the law
                                    he has transcended. It is one of the inconveniences which attach
                                    to such errors of judgment, and which illustrate their practical
                                    dangers, that all punishments visited on criminals outside of
                                    the laws array a certain sympathy in favor of the culprit,
                                    however guilty he may be. Colonel Arguelles may be the criminal
                                    he is represented to be by the Cuban authorities, but as these
                                    authorities are now seized of his person in a way not authorized
                                    by our laws, the penalty he may be called to pay for his alleged
                                    crime is one which concerns the honor of the nation in the eyes
                                    of the civilized world. It is to be hoped, for the sake of our
                                    own credit on the score of humanity, that the proceedings of
                                    Spanish jurisprudence in his case may be such as to show that
                                    only justice has been done him in the forum to which we have
                                    remitted him, even if something less than justice, as justice is
                                    understood in this country, has been done him by our authorities
                                    in the circumstances under which they have delivered him up for
                                    trial. The civilized world sits in judgment not only on the
                                    crimes of men, but on the processes by which these crimes are
                                    redressed; and when justice is inflicted against the received
                                    rules of justice, men never fail to resent the wrong done to the
                                    latter, whatever may be their abhorrence at the wickedness of
                                    the criminal. It was thus that all Europe thrilled with
                                    indignation and horror at the conduct of the King of Saxony,
                                    when, in the early part of the 18th century, he delivered up the
                                    person of the unhappy Patkul to the vengeance of his <pb

                                    XIIth, of Sweden, who broke him on the wheel. Men refused to
                                    consider the provocations which that nobleman had offered to his
                                    king, or the offences he had committed against his country, in
                                    their resentment at the wrong done to the “right of asylum” in
                                    his person. And so, whatever may be the crimes of Colonel
                                    Arguelles, (about which we know nothing personally, as the
                                    President of the United States knows nothing legally,) the
                                    civilized world, in its respect for the principles of public law
                                    and private right violated by his clandestine arrest and
                                    deportation, will not hesitate to deplore the process by which
                                    this Spanish subject has been brought to justice.</p>

                                <p>Sentence in the criminal cause prosecuted in this supreme court
                                    against Don José Agustin Arguelles, formerly lieutenant governor
                                    of the district of Colon; D. Antonio Pratts, local judge of
                                    Palmillas; D. José Toral, lieutenant in the municipal guard; D.
                                    José Palma, deputy captain at Macaqua; D. Manuel Azuela, who
                                    filled the like grade at Yaguaramos; D. Mariano Aguirre,
                                    secretary of the lieutenancy of the governorship of Colon; D.

                                    Arias, deputy lieutenant at Palmillas; D. Saturnino Santurio,
                                    lieutenant, municipal alcalde of Colon; D. Manuel Martieres,
                                    commissary of police of the same settlement; D. Matias Gispert,
                                    professor of medicine and secretary of the board of health; D.
                                    Eugenio Aroiaza, advocate and prefect of the municipality; D.
                                    Maximiliano Molino, secretary thereof; and D. Antonio
                                    Zucarriche, for stealing some Bozal negroes, apprehended as
                                    belonging to a shipment captured within the judicial district of
                                    Colon and Cienfuegos, and for falsifications committed to hinder
                                    the discovery of this crime.</p>
                                <p>It appearing in regard to the proceeding that the suit was
                                    instituted by this court for ascertaining who were the persons
                                    responsible for an introduction of Dozal negroes, effected
                                    within the jurisdictions referred to, in the month of November,
                                    1863, and that the individuals aforesaid, subject to this
                                    proceeding, were comprehended therein for the culpability which
                                    might attach to them from the subtraction of a considerable
                                    portion of the captured negroes, for the sale of same, and for
                                    the falsifications practiced to cover up these crimes; and that
                                    the summary inquiry being ended, and conclusion reached that the
                                    stealing and falsifications are criminal acts, entirely distinct
                                    from the introduction of African negroes, inasmuch as they
                                    constitute ordinary crimes, which in this case were perpetrated
                                    through an abuse of the administrative authority which was
                                    exercised by D. José Agustin Arguelles. Separate action was
                                    instituted for that investigation, and report was made to the
                                    supreme court of justice, which, by directions dated the 25th
                                    April last and 12th August ordered that certifications of
                                    progress should be periodically rendered to it.</p>
                                <p>[The continuance of this document, in brief, shows the devices
                                    resorted to by the accused to evade the administration of the
                                    laws bearing on the offence of stealing negroes, and making
                                    falsified returns to government of the Bozals landed, and then
                                    captured by order of Arguelles. The negroes were landed, brought
                                    into the jurisdiction and the safeguards of the law. Prats
                                    reports that on Novemver 12, 1863, he took what were reported as
                                    1,009. Arguelles reported fewer, and that many had died, and
                                    several missing. Other reckonings made 1,008, and various other
                                    numbers. Investigation being had, it was proven that more than
                                    100 had been sold as slaves, among them 11 to Onagdren, 7 to
                                    Requo, 1 to Capote, 5 to Perey, 4 to Criade, 9 to Medens, 2 to

                                    Fovente, 1 to Eseobedo. That Arguelles gave in pay and

                            It was written, indeed, before the Spanish government had received
                            direct and full information from its agents in Peru. Nevertheless, your
                            account of the demonstrations which that government has made concerning
                            the unhappy difficulties at Lima seems to authorize an expectation that
                            these difficulties will be adjusted in a way that shall be at once
                            peaceful and consistent with the safety, honor, and welfare of both

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On the 20th of this month there were
                            ratified by the Queen two treaties of recognition, peace and friendship
                            made some time in 1863; one with the perpetual president of Guatemala,
                            and the other with the Argentine Republic.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th of June the ministers of both those republics were received
                            in audience by the Queen. At the same time the minister of Nicaragua,
                            Señor de Marcoleto, presented his credentials; a treaty of recognition,
                            peace and friendship having existed between Spain and that republic for
                            some time previous.</p>
                        <pb facs="0111" n="87" xml:id="pg_87"/>
                        <p>I enclose the treaties and reception speeches. Whether these
                            ratifications and receptions were purely accidental, or whether they
                            were made to take place just at this juncture, with a view to show
                            cordial relations with some of the Spanish American republics, and to
                            quiet certain apprehensions which have necessarily arisen on account of
                            the Peruvian troubles, I am not able to decide positively. But the
                            latter alternative seems probable enough. I believe none of the
                            ministers of these republics will remain here. They are or have been for
                            some time accredited at Paris and other courts to which they will
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Despatch No. 96 is still missing. Since I acknowledged receipt of your
                            despatches 98, 99, 100 and 101, I have received 102, 103 and 104.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the treaty for the settlement of the limits of the maritime
                            jurisdiction of Spain, in the waters of Cuba, I had heretofore confined
                            myself to a bare statement to Mr. Pacheco, that it does not appear that
                            Mr. Tassara had received instructions to sign it.</p>
                        <p>He said he only recollected that there had been some such question, but
                            he said he would look into it. I have since ascertained from the chief
                            of the bureau to which the relations with the United States belong, that
                            no instructions had been sent by the Marquis of Miraflores. I judge from
                            your despatch 102 that you do not wish me to urge the matter.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, sir, your obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Some days ago Mr. Moreira, the consul of
                            Peru at Madrid, handed me a memorandum of certain propositions made by
                            the Spanish government to that of Peru to be transmitted by him to his
                            government. Mr. Moreira told me at the same time of Mr. Pacheco’s having
                            informed him that I would be furnished with a copy of the memorandum for
                            communication to my government. I have not yet received it, but have
                            ascertained that such a copy has been ordered to be made, and to be sent
                            to me, but, owing to the customary delay in the different bureaus here,
                            it has not yet reached me. I enclose a translated copy.</p>
                        <p>I confess that those propositions do not entirely correspond with the
                            conciliatory language held to me by Mr. Pacheco on previous occasions,
                            nor even with his speech in the Cortes. They are not in form, nor in
                            substance, such as will, in my humble opinion, secure at once a
                            peaceable settlement. They are conceived in a spirit which seems to take
                            it for granted that Peru has committed a series of wrongs, and that the
                            conduct of Spain, or rather her agents, is wholly immaculate.</p>
                        <p>It appears right enough for Spain to demand that Peru should disavow its
                            complicity with the alleged attempts on Mr. Salazar’s life, and that
                            this avowal should precede all further negotiations; but whether the
                            Spanish government may insist that this should be done by a special
                            commissioner to be sent for that express purpose to Madrid is quite a
                            different question. It seems to me that the manner in which to make the
                            disavowal ought to have been left to the choice of Peru.</p>
                        <p>Again, this avowal having been made, should not the <hi rend="italic"
                                >formal</hi> reception of the Spanish commissioner (assurances of
                            such reception being previously given by <pb facs="0112" n="88"
                                xml:id="pg_88"/> Peru) <hi rend="italic">be preceded</hi> by a
                            restoration of the islands? or if Spain objects to that, should not the
                            acts of reception and delivery be at the least simultaneous?</p>
                        <p>It seems to me, also, but right that Admiral Pinzon should be relieved
                            from command; nor can I see any propriety in a large increase of the
                            Spanish fleet in the Pacific, such a measure looking very much like a
                            menace.</p>
                        <p>I have not been able to see Mr. Pacheco since I have read and examined
                            the memorandum. I shall probably see him to-day, and I will make an
                            effort to persuade him to make some modifications. I doubt the success
                            of my undertaking, as the memorandum has been considered and approved by
                            the council of ministers. But I think I ought to leave nothing untried
                            which is proper and not calculated to offend Spanish susceptibilities,
                            in order to prevent a serious rupture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pacheco’s great, perhaps only defect as a statesman, according to the
                            information given me by those who have known him long and well, is a
                            certain pliancy and lack of firmness. I believe that he has been made to
                            intensify his demands by some of his hot-headed colleagues in the
                            ministry.</p>
                        <p>This being mail day, I must close by adding merely that a ministerial
                            crisis is again threatened. The principal question which divides the
                            ministry, and brings some of them in collision with the desire and the
                            plans of the Queen, is whether her mother Christina, ignominiously

                            <p>1. The Peruvian government will send a diplomatic representative of
                                note to Madrid, who will have to declare in its name, and with all
                                solemnity, that it disavows the design of the authorities of Callao,
                                so far as they wanted to take prisoner the secretary of the Spanish
                                commissioner, and that those authorities (whatever they may have
                                been) are already removed from office, and that the said government
                                has not promoted or in any way participated in the attempts on the
                                person of the Spanish commissioner, made by Peruvians, during his
                                voyage from Callao to Paita, Panama, and Aspinwall, and is disposed
                                to punish these persons.</p>
                            <p>2. The Spanish government will send a representative to Lima with the
                                object to claim that justice be administered in the Talambo case,
                                and with credentials equal to those which Mr. Salazar had, which
                                commissioner is to be received by the Peruvian government.</p>
                            <p>3. Immediately upon this reception the Chincha islands will be
                                delivered over to a commissioner nominated by the Peruvian
                                government.</p>
                            <p>4. Peru will appoint and send to Spain a plenipotentiary in order to
                                arrange on prudent terms, and in complete good faith, a treaty
                                between said republic and the Spanish nation, similar to those which
                                have been concluded with the other Spanish American republics.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I succeeded in having an interview with
                            Mr. Pacheco last evening. I expressed to him, speaking as a private
                            individual, my doubts as to the acceptance of the propositions in their
                            present shape, and made such suggestions to modify them as I indicated I
                            would make in my last despatch (107.) He replied, that except the demand
                            for a disavowal of participation in the attempts on Mr. Salazar’s life,
                            which was added to suit later events, the rest of the propositions was
                            based upon what had been previously offered by Mr. Moreira, the Peruvian
                            consul; and, as that gentleman had shown him instructions to negotiate,
                            he thought he could do no less than to ask what was offered. He referred
                            me to Mr. M. for the truth of what he said. * * * *</p>

                            circular, dated June 24, 1864, directed by Mr. Pacheco to the diplomatic
                            representatives of Spain. I presume that Mr. Tassara has placed you in
                            possession of it ere this, as it was sent to him by last week’s packet,
                            and some five or six days before it was published here. I consider it
                            more satisfactory than his speech in the Senate, though it labors under
                            the same want of logic. Prom the premises laid down by the minister, the
                            inevitable conclusion would have been an instantaneous order to restore
                            the islands of Chincha. * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Since my last despatch, (111,) I have received No. 96, together with
                            copies of another series of documents relating to the Peruvian question.
                            The package being quite heavy, Mr. Miller, in London, did not send it by
                            mail, but by the Spanish courier, which will account for the delay,
                            which, however, was of no consequence, as all these documents had been
                            fully published in the Madrid journals long ago, and had, of course,
                            received my most careful attention. There is no despatch missing except
                            No. 106.</p>
                        <p>The general expectation here is that the conflict with Peru will be
                            amicably settled, and that permanent relations between that country and
                            Spain will be established.</p>
                        <p>The same evening that the state department received its American mail the
                            “Epoca,” a paper in the interests of the ministry, contained the
                            following article, of which I give you a translation:</p>
                        <p>“We have to-day received despatches from the United States which are very
                            satisfactory to Spain. The explanations given by Mr. Tassara on the real
                            policy of the Spanish government in America, and, above all, the
                            official knowledge of the despatch of our minister of state, dated the
                            24th of May, and which was received in Washington in the middle of June,
                            have done away with all fears and all accusations made by the enemies of
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>“We know that the government of the United States has been the first to
                            advise the government of Peru to give to Spain the satisfactions which
                            are legitimate, being sure that our country would respect the
                            independence of the American states. <hi rend="italic">The government of
                                Washington, as well as that of Rio Janeiro, offer their good offices
                                to disentangle these difficulties, which, however, Spain will bring
                                to a close directly with Peru.”</hi></p>
                        <p>I have underscored the last lines, they being another intimation that
                            Spain declines at least a formal mediation, which, as far as this
                            legation is concerned, was never offered. My note to Mr. Pacheco, of the
                            20th of May, (four days before he issued his diplomatic circular of the
                            24th,) and of which I have sent you a copy, is the only document passed
                            on the subject, and my subsequent conversations with him have never
                            exceeded, if they have reached the terms used in that note as respects
                            the tendering of our good offices.</p>
                        <p>Rumors of a popular rising in Madrid are still afloat. I am not able to
                            discover any symptoms of it, nor do I think that there is at present any
                            conjuncture of affairs in Spain which would be likely to produce violent
                            commotions. Yet it will never do to speculate here. The character of
                            this southern people will always be, to some extent, incomprehensible to
                            a northern mind, since they act generally upon mere impulses and
                            momentary passions, which of course lie beyond human foresight and
                            calculation.</p>
                        <p>The government seems to be strangely alarmed. Last Wednesday night, at
                            about 11 o’clock, the principal guard of the city at the <hi
                                rend="italic">Puerto del Sol</hi> was increased all at once by no
                            less than 200 troops; messengers called all the officers from their
                            clubs, coffee-houses, and the theatres, to the barracks, and the
                            soldiers there were kept on the <hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi> for
                            several hours. These measures created some excitement in the streets,
                            promenades, and cafes, which here in Madrid, about midnight, are
                            generally as much crowded as Broadway is about noon. But I saw no
                            disorder, only people wondering what this all meant. The captain general
                            of New Castile, who ordered the forces out, it is now alleged, was
                            trifled with by some false denunciation, and he has offered to resign,
                            but his resignation will not be accepted.</p>

                        <p>The King will visit France in August to return the visit of the Empress
                            last fall. There is, of course, a good deal of wild talk in the papers
                            about a peculiar object in view, about alliances offensive and
                            defensive, about Gibraltar and the like. The court and ministerial
                            journals speak of it as only a visit of unavoidable courtesy, which
                            seems to me the most probable. The King, though in a certain sense
                            tolerably well educated and possessing many accomplishments, seems to me
                            to have no reach of mind, and to be wholly unable to grasp great
                            political ideas. Besides, constitutional principles have taken root in
                            Spain deep enough to prevent any ministry letting the King, who,
                            however, is only so by title, go out on important diplomatic errands. No
                            visit of his to France, however, will be liked by the people here, who
                            distrust and hate, if not the French people, at least every French
                            government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I am indebted to you for a very lucid and
                            interesting account of your conversation with Mr. Pacheco, and the
                            situation of the Peruvian government at Madrid. It was natural, and
                            indeed unavoidable, that there should be much excitement at that capital
                            when information arrived there of the demonstrations which were made
                            against Mr. Salazar on his way from Peru to Europe. Nevertheless, the
                            interests of peace remain always unaffected by popular commotions. I
                            trust, therefore, that her Catholic Majesty’s government will be
                            favorably disposed towards an adjustment of the controversy with Peru
                            upon a just and honorable basis.</p>
                        <p>I have some grounds for believing that Peru will send a proper agent to
                            Madrid in such a character, and for such a purpose as I have heretofore
                            suggested in my correspondence with Mr. Robinson and yourself. Should
                            Mr. Barreda, who now represents Peru here, go out to Madrid, you will
                            find him a fair, honorable, and discreet person. In the mean time it
                            will not be inexpedient for you to continue your good offices. I think
                            that the pressure of the South American states upon this government for
                            symathy and aid entitles us to expect that the Spanish government will
                            regard us as acting in a spirit not less friendly to Spain than to Peru,
                            and solely with a view to prevent, so far as we can, an enlargement of
                            the theatre of war.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            June 22, No. 105, have been received. Having submitted these interesting
                            papers to the President, I am authorized to approve and commend the
                            diligence and practical wisdom with <pb facs="0116" n="92"

                            Peru.</p>
                        <p>The frank and liberal sentiments expressed to you by Mr. Pacheco induce a
                            hope that on the arrival of a discreet and honorable agent of Peru at
                            Madrid an accommodation mutually honorable and satisfactory to both
                            countries can be effected. Mr. Barreda, whom I have already mentioned to
                            you, will embark on the 20th instant, although he has as yet received no
                            especial charge from the president of Peru; yet I have no doubt that on
                            his arrival in Spain he will receive authority to make all needful
                            explanations. I cheerfully commend him to your confidence and
                            esteem.</p>
                        <p>You were altogether right in assuring the Spanish government that our
                            obligations of neutrality will be justly and honorably performed.</p>

                        <p>In the evening papers of yesterday was found a telegram to the effect
                            that the French consul at Lima (France representing the interests of
                            Spain in Peru, while there are no diplomatic relations between the
                            latter country and Spain,) has agreed upon a complete settlement of the
                            points in dispute with the government of Peru. In a day or two the truth
                            of this news can probably be ascertained here in the Department of
                            State.</p>

                        <p>There have been partial disturbances in Barcelona and Valencia. They are
                            ascribed by the government to merely local grievances and as of no
                            political importance. But there is certainly more agitation and
                            uneasiness in the country at present than at any other time since I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 23d of June, No. 107, which is
                            accompanied by a copy of a memorandum that has been communicated by Mr.
                            Pacheco to the Peruvian consul residing at Madrid.</p>
                        <p>I have read that instrument carefully, and while I agree with you, that
                            the government of Spain might well have adopted a more free and direct
                            proceeding in restoring the Chincha islands to Peru, I must confess, at
                            the same time, that the disposition which the former government
                            manifests in this overture is pacific and friendly. I cannot think that,
                            under the changed circumstances, the government of Peru ought or could
                            wisely take a stand upon the ground of ceremony which also seems to be
                            left open by the government of Spain. I shall forbear, however, from
                            expressing this opinion to the government of Peru, which may justly
                            claim, as Spain does, to be sole guardian of the national honor. It is
                            expected that before this despatch shall have reached you Mr. Barreda
                            will have appeared at Madrid. I will thank you to make its contents
                            confidentially known to that judicious and esteemed representative of
                            Peru.</p>

                            to complain to that of Spain of the treatment received by our vessels in
                            passing the forts of Tarifa, in the Straits of Gibraltar; and American
                            ships have been more than once pierced with shot from these forts
                            because they were either slow or careless in complying with the
                            regulation that all vessels must show their flags on passing within
                            range of the guns of the forts.</p>
                        <p>I take pleasure, therefore, to enclose the copy of a circular note
                            addressed to me by Mr. Pacheco on the 31st July, in which he advises our
                            government of a very favorable change in the orders given to the
                            officers commanding the forts of Tarifa and Isla Verde, and from the
                            tenor of which it is to be hoped that the act of firing into the hulls
                            of unarmed merchantmen in time of peace will not again be repeated.</p>
                        <p>It may be well to publish these new regulations for the information of

                                the Secretary of War the action taken on various occasions near the
                                government of her Majesty by some <pb facs="0118" n="94"
                                    xml:id="pg_94"/> foreign representatives, accredited to this
                                court, with the object of introducing some favorable modification of
                                the rules observed at the fortresses of Tarifa and Isla Verde, to
                                oblige vessels navigating the jurisdictional waters of those
                                fortresses to hoist the flag of their nations, a practice which they
                                often neglect, alleging a very improbable ignorance in vessels which
                                so repeatedly pass the straits, the aforesaid secretary replied to
                                me, under date of 21st ultimo, that the department in his charge,
                                and at that date, had issued to the captain general of Andalusia,
                                who has under his immediate command the fortresses of Tarifa and
                                Isla Verde, the instructions following, to which, in future, the
                                commandants of the said fortresses will adhere.</p>
                            <p>1. “To every vessel which, on crossing the line of said fortresses,
                                within range of its cannon, does not show the flag of her nation,
                                (the Spanish flag floating over the fortress,) notice shall be given
                                of the neglect she is falling into by discharging a cannon loaded
                                with powder only.”</p>
                            <p>2. “If, after the lapse of 10 minutes, she should not have hoisted
                                her flag, a shotted gun shall be fired ahead and across her
                                prow.”</p>
                            <p>3. If, notwithstanding these two indicated notices, and the lapse of
                                another 10 minutes, she omit to hoist her flag, a third discharge
                                with balls shall be fired at her masts.”</p>
                            <p>In bringing the preceding dispositions to your knowledge, so that you
                                may give a translation of them to the government of the American
                                Union, the Queen, my sovereign lady, flatters herself that the
                                cabinet of Washington will find in the measures adopted a fresh
                                proof of the sentiments of deference which her government entertains
                                for the nation you so worthily represent.</p>

                            and 113, of the 11th and 15th July, were received by me on the 1st and
                            4th of August, and their purport was immediately communicated to Mr.
                            Koerner, in Germany.</p>
                        <p>I note especially your views upon the present condition of the Peruvian
                            question, based upon the information conveyed in Mr. Koerner’s
                            despatches to you previous to and including his No. 105, of June 22. His
                            subsequent despatches on the subject, Nos. 107 of June 28, 108 of June
                            29, and 109 of July 2, will vary in some degree the inferences drawn
                            from those first communicated. I am of opinion, nevertheless, that Spain
                            is not desirous of war with Peru, and that the arrival of a special
                            Peruvian envoy at this court is the best step which could have been
                            imagined tending to bring about a satisfactory arrangement of the
                            question. He may find more difficulty than was expected at the date of
                            the earlier despatches, afterwards modified by subsequent developments
                            here, but I trust these difficulties will be overcome.</p>

                            reach the point of insurrection. I am informed that the entire regiment
                            (3 batallions) was prepared and impatient for action; but the movement
                            did not take place on account of the refusal of certain leaders to
                            co-operate. A lieutenant and five sergeants are now on trial before
                            court-martial.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday General Milans del Bosch was ordered to the Canary islands and
                            assigned to the command of the Great Canary, a kind of honorable exile.
                            General Contreras was ordered to report to the captain general of
                            Corunna, on the northwest coast. Coronel the Count of Cuba is sent to
                            Oviedo. These are all friends of General Prim. General Queseda, military
                            governor of Madrid, has been replaced by General Cervino, (an adherent
                            of O’Donnel,) and Coronel Gonzales, of the regiment <hi rend="italic"
                                >Savoy,</hi> by Coronel Cos-Gayon. Though there was, undoubtedly,
                            good motive for alarm on the part of the government, and these sparks
                            show, to some extent, what fire is slumbering under cover in Spain, I
                            beg to repeat the opinion expressed in my No. 115, of July 25, and do
                            not anticipate any considerable insurrectionary movement at present.</p>

                        <p>I think it more desirable to confirm and establish friendly and
                            harmonious relations with Spain at the present moment than to discuss
                            irritating private claims on either side. Probably even just claims
                            could never be urged under circumstances more unfavorable than the
                            present. While, therefore, you will waive none of those with which you
                            are charged, it is not expected that you will be especially urgent about
                            those of Mr. E. and Mr. L., who have voluntarily withdrawn from the
                            United States, and taken up their residence in San Domingo.</p>

                                unpleasant controversy between Spain and Peru.</p>
                            <p>I regret to be obliged to infer from your despatch that the
                                government of Peru has not yet thought it expedient to send an
                                authorized agent to Madrid. It seems to the President that the steps
                                taken by the Spanish government reduce the dispute to a point of
                                mere diplomatic significance, upon which it would be unwise for
                                either party to incur the responsibility of delaying a settlement.
                                We have spoken in this sense to the government of Spain.</p>

                                receipt of your despatches Nos. 114 and 115. The former is marked
                                “confidential” and contains a copy of two despatches from the
                                minister of the United States at the court of Madrid, relating to
                                the present controversy between Spain and Peru. There was no extract
                                from any despatch of Mr. Dayton accompanying your No. 114 to me.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday I had an interview with Mr. Ribeyro, and communicated to
                                him the suggestion that Peru might, under the present circumstances,
                                send a minister plenipotentiary to Madrid, fully authorized to make
                                an arrangement of all the pending difficulties. He replied that, as
                                yet, the government of Peru had received no reply from Mr. Pacheco,
                                the minister of foreign relations of Spain, to the note of the 12th
                                of April, addressed to him by Mr. Ribeyro, and till an answer was
                                received it was impossible to determine whether their envoy would be
                                received in that capacity. Mr. Ribeyro expressed to me, in the
                                strongest language, the high appreciation which he personally, and
                                the government of Peru, entertained for the kind and friendly,
                                feelings and acts of the cabinet at Washington.</p>
                            <p>The near approach of the session of Congress, which opens on the 28th
                                of this month, and the expectations that the Spanish question will
                                be thoroughly examined and discussed by that body, in which
                                discussion will be presented fully and authoritatively the views of
                                the people of Peru, will undoubtedly induce great caution in the
                                conduct of the cabinet here. These discussions it is to be hoped
                                will modify materially the feeling too prevalent among the masses
                                that the difficulty should be settled by an appeal to arms. It
                                cannot be denied that the conduct of the Spanish officials in taking
                                possession of the Chincha islands is regarded among all classes of
                                the people as an intentional insult to the dignity and honor of
                                Peru, and till both the acts and language of these officials are
                                disavowed, the opinion among the Peruvian citizens is that there is
                                no place for negotiation.</p>

                                have now the honor to inform you that the government of her Majesty
                                has been pleased to approve the measure adopted by the superior
                                governor of the island of Cuba, in respect to impeding the entrance
                                into the port of the Havana of the boats of foreign vessels-of-war
                                which themselves remain outside. In the sole case that the said
                                vessels should be in urgent need of succor, it will be permitted to
                                the vessel demanding it to remain without communication at the
                                entrance of the port, whilst the consul of the nation to which the
                                vessel belongs furnishes the same. In the adoption of this measure,
                                observed by all nations in their port regulations, the government of
                                her Majesty has had no other object than to put in operation the
                                rules of maritime police and of sanitary police of that island.</p>

                        <p>Nos. 114 and 115, upon the questions pending between Spain and Peru, have
                            crossed in the mail with my Nos. 119, 121, 122, and 123, addressed to
                            you on the same subject, and I am especially gratified to find that the
                            ideas which have guided me are in all respects harmonious with those
                            instructions dictated by your superior judgment.</p>
                        <p>I have been a little doubtful, after the letter of August 22d from Mr.
                            Barreda, enclosed in my No. 123 to you, whether to wait his arrival, or
                            communicate your No. 115 to him in writing. Knowing, however, the just
                            importance Mr. Barreda attaches to your opinion, I have imagined that
                            perhaps this most opportune despatch might have the effect to bring him
                            to Spain, where you suppose him to be, and where undoubtedly he ought to
                            be at this moment, if he has any power at all to act in the name of his
                            government. I have sent him, therefore, a copy, under the mark of “<hi
                                rend="italic">strictly confidential.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>The indications contained in your No. 16, of August 12, will guide my
                            conduct in the matters to which it relates; and I beg to thank you for
                            the clear and impartial summaries of military events contained in your
                            Nos. 15 and 18, this last of August 15.</p>
                        <p>I shall wait here the arrival of the next mail steamer from America, and
                            if nothing further should reach me from Mr. Barreda, will then return to
                            San Ildefonso.</p>

                            Spanish flag from that island. He has energy enough for that step, but
                            whether he will think proper to take it or not, the journals are

                        <p>The members of the new cabinet have all been ministers before, and four
                            of them prime ministers. They are able men, and if they continue united
                            under the impulse of the rigorous will of Narvaez, may yet give a strong
                            government to Spain.</p>
                        <p>Your despatches Nos. 21 and 22 have reached me, and I take special notice
                            of your interview with Mr. Tassara, in which the neutrality of the
                            Isthmus of Panama, under certain circumstances, was the subject of
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>I hope soon to have an interview with Marshal Narvaez, which I have no
                            doubt will be interesting, upon the subject of the questions pending
                            with Peru.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have just received your despatch of the
                            28th of August, together with its accompaniment, which is a private
                            letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Barreda, <pb facs="0124" n="100"
                                xml:id="pg_100"/> on the 22d ultimo. That letter is patriotically
                            expressed, as well as loyally conceived.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barreda has there indicated to yon a division of counsels which may
                            unhappily arise in Peru on the course to be adopted with regard to the
                            Spanish question. The ministry which was in power when Mr. Barreda left
                            this country for Europe was understood to favor a conciliatory course.
                            That disposition seems to have been unsatisfactory to the House of
                            Representatives, which demanded a more peremptory attitude.</p>
                        <p>A new ministry has been created, and it has taken the attitude thus
                            required.</p>
                        <p>It is manifest that insomuch as the real dispute has given place to one
                            which involves only the order and the form in which the parties shall
                            advance toward a settlement upon principles mutually satisfactory, and
                            insomuch as neither party asks leave, or manifests a willingness to
                            invoke friendly offices, to adjust that latter question, we can do no
                            more than to urge upon both of them, by a just regard to their own
                            interests, and to the interests of humanity, to consider how great would
                            be the misfortune if they should suffer such a mere misunderstanding to
                            ripen unnecessarily into flagrant war. What you have said to Mr.
                            Pacheco, and all that you have written to Mr. Barreda, was well and
                            wisely said and written, and is approved.</p>
                        <p>I give you confidentially a copy of my last note upon the subject to Mr.
                            Robinson.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On Thursday, the 22d instant, being the day
                            set apart by the new minister of state for the reception of the
                            representatives of foreign powers, I enjoined the opportunity for half
                            an hour’s conversation with Señor Llorente upon the various subjects of
                            interest between the two countries and the question now pending between
                            Spain and Peru.</p>
                        <p>On this latter point I am glad to report that Señor Llorente confirmed to
                            me, in the fullest and completest manner, the assurances heretofore
                            given by Mr Pacheco, that the government of Spain had no idea at all of
                            territorial aggrandizement, and no purpose to occupy permanently a foot
                            of the Peruvian territory.</p>
                        <p>He mentioned the circular letter of Mr. Pacheco, of the 24th June, and
                            his declarations in the senate with approval. He himself had not had
                            time, as minister, to study the Peruvian affair. Mr. Salazar and
                            Mazarredo had been with him the day before. He did not know what his own
                            opinion about that business would be, and the council of ministers had
                            not had their attention called to it as yet; but this much he could
                            assure me, without any hesitation, that the Monroe doctrine of the
                            United States would not be called in question by any proceeding of Spain
                            in or against Peru.</p>
                        <p>If President Monroe himself were alive and on the spot, he should see
                            nothing running at all counter to his famous declaration. Spain would
                            treat Peru precisely as she would treat any other foreign nation with
                            whom she had a difference, but whose territories she did not covet.</p>
                        <p>I alluded in an entirely informal way to your late conference with Mr.
                            Tassara, reported in your instruction No. 21, of August 26, touching
                            upon the treaty stipulations between the United States and New Granada
                            about the neutrality of the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Llorente said he had not seen Mr. Tassara’s report of your interview
                            with him, and thanking me for drawing his attention to the point, the
                            conversation dropped.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had a long conversation with Señor
                            Llorente on Thursday, which I endeavored to make as informal as
                            possible, relating to the difficulties between Spain and Peru.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Meantime I am informed that Admiral Pinzon is removed from his command,
                            to take effect as soon as his successor can arrive out. Admiral Pareja,
                            late minister of the navy, is designated to replace him; but I am told
                            he has himself made some objection on account of his connexion with the
                            last cabinet in power when the news of Admiral Pinzon’s exploit reached
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Llorente told me that he had information the Peruvian government was
                            endeavoring to purchase ships-of-war in the United States to be used
                            against Spain, and asked me whether that would be permitted? I said that
                            I was ignorant of the circumstances of the case he referred to, but I
                            had no difficulty in stating that, in case of war between the two
                            nations, much as we should regret that termination to the present
                            dispute, he might rely upon it that our neutrality would be impartially
                            enforced. I said, also, that we did not understand neutrality as it had
                            lately been practiced by England towards the United States; that we were
                            complaining now of the facilities afforded to our own insurgents for the
                            purchase of war ships in England to be used against ourselves, and that
                            we certainly would not permit a similar abuse by either belligerent
                            within our own jurisdiction. Mr. Llorente said he was satisfied with
                            that reply.</p>
                        <p>Seeing the turn this business is now taking, I thought proper to show to
                            Mr. Llorente your despatches, Nos. 114 and 115, addressed to Mr.
                            Koerner, and <pb facs="0126" n="102" xml:id="pg_102"/> also a letter
                            which Mr. Barreda addressed to me on the 19th ultimo, from Paris, in
                            which he says that the new cabinet at Lima is composed of men
                            distinguished for their ability and the moderation of their views. After
                            he had read your instructions, seeming to be favorably impressed with
                            their tenor, I took occasion to again call to mind, in a wholly informal
                            and unofficial way, the willingness of the government of the United
                            States to act as might seem most favorable to the preservation of peace,
                            in order to procure the settlement of any preliminary question which
                            might impede Spain and Peru from coming together on the equal footing of
                            ordinary diplomatic intercourse for the negotiation of the affairs they
                            may have to treat together. I stated that I had no instructions to offer
                            the mediation of the United States, but I was aware that such mediation
                            had heretofore been sought by Peru, and I supposed it would still be
                            accepted by that power. I had no doubt that whatsoever the President of
                            the United States might say would be considered as of great weight by
                            the government of Peru, and would be sure to command its serious
                            attention. Mr. Llorente had now seen the contents of two confidential
                            despatches from you, never intended to be read to him, and which I had
                            taken the responsibility of exhibiting informally, perhaps, against your
                            judgment, and certainly without your authority. The opinion of the
                            government of the United States upon the present state of the Peruvian
                            question, as it was left by the circular of Mr. Pacheco, was thus known
                            to him beyond a doubt. I begged him, therefore, to consider whether this
                            difference, reduced in fact to one of mere form or ceremony, might not
                            well be submitted for its solution to the decision of a third party,
                            equally free from all suspicion of bias on either side. Spain really
                            disapproved the ill-advised action of her agents—had no wish nor
                            interest to maintain an armament in the Pacific ocean, and hesitated
                            only upon the question of how to withdraw her flag with honor. Peru, on
                            her side, was really not averse to entertaining diplomatic intercourse
                            with Spain on the footing of perfect equality between the two nations,
                            and to negotiating in good faith upon all the questions pending between
                            the two governments prior to the arrival of Señor Salazar at Lima, but
                            she hesitated upon the question how consistently with honor to bring
                            things back to this point after what had occurred at Lima and in the
                            Chincha islands.</p>
                        <p>The whole difference was reduced to this: The exigencies of Spanish honor
                            seemed exaggerated to Peru, and those of Peruvian honor seemed
                            unreasonable to Spain. The proposition to yield anything directly in
                            such a question suggested, it seemed, the idea of humiliation.</p>
                        <p>Was not this precisely the moment when the unbiased judgment of a mutual
                            friend ought to step in to settle the point? There could be nothing
                            humiliating in accepting the decision of a third party in such a case.
                            Spain or Peru might either of them yield a point to the dispassionate
                            judgment of the United States, which they would not have yielded the one
                            to the other. The world would certainly understand, even in the extreme
                            case, that some concession should be unduly made, (which, however, could
                            not be supposed,) that the responsibility of such error would no longer
                            touch the honor of either of the principal parties, but it would fall
                            upon the mediator himself.</p>
                        <p>I repeated I was not authorized to offer the mediation of the United
                            States, and what I was saying must be considered as entirely extra
                            official, and not as coming from my government. The government of the
                            United States had no interest at all to press this or the other view
                            upon the attention of Spain, but if the reasonableness of what I said
                            should strike Señor Llorente, apart from all consideration of its
                            source, he was already aware that Peru had solicited our mediation, and
                            if Spain desired it, I would not hesitate to transmit that wish to Mr.
                            Seward.</p>
                        <p>Even without a formal mediation I should be glad to be personally useful
                            in any way which might conduce to peace and a good understanding between
                            the agents of the disputing powers.</p>
                        <pb facs="0127" n="103" xml:id="pg_103"/>
                        <p>Mr. Llorente listened to these remarks with great attention, and thanked
                            me warmly for the offers with which I concluded, saying that he would
                            weigh what I had said, and consult with his colleagues about it.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of the highest respect, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>Your No. 27, upon the events at home, is heart-cheering. We have
                            subsequent telegrams indicating the continued and brilliant success of
                            General Sheridan, who has again routed the army of General Early at
                            Strasburg, taking from him sixteen cannon. This seems to be a rapid and
                            disorganizing pursuit at a point so vital as to be almost decisive of
                            the fate of the campaign in Virginia. If Early cannot hold Sheridan in
                            his victorious march up the valley toward Charlottesville and Lynchburg,
                            it is hard for us here to see how General Lee can long avoid the
                            necessity of evacuating Richmond and Petersburg. Whilst I wait,
                            therefore, still more important results to come out of these events in
                            the valley of the Shenandoah, permit me to congratulate you with all my
                            heart upon the changed aspect of affairs so eloquently set forth in your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have your despatch of the 2d of October,
                            No. 128, and I not only approve but I commend the zeal and diligence you
                            have exercised in your labors to secure a continuance of peace between
                            Peru and Spain. I shall not now approve of so much of the
                            representations and suggestions which you have made to Mr. Llorente on
                            that subject as was not warranted by express directions from this
                            department. At the same time, I am far from being disposed to censure
                            this portion of your proceedings, and, on the contrary, I rather incline
                            to hope that your representations may be crowned with beneficial
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Upon a careful consideration of the state of the case as you have
                            presented it to me, it has been deemed expedient on my part to advise
                            Mr. Barreda, who is now in Europe, to seek an interview with you, and
                            learn from you informally and unofficially the facts in regard to the
                            disposition of the Spanish government which you have communicated to me.
                            His sagacity will enable him to determine what course to suggest to his
                            government at Lima. I shall communicate with Mr. Barreda by the mail
                            which carries this despatch.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>We learn unofficially that the United
                            States ship Niagara lately overhauled and temporarily detained the
                            Cicerone, a steamer which bore the Spanish flag. We have as yet no
                            report of the transaction from the commander of the Niagara; but we are
                            advised by a correspondent in London that the vessel had been described
                            to the commander as an insurgent one recently engaged in the African
                            slave trade, and now carrying a naval armament to the rebels. It is
                            supposed, although not known here, that this information was, upon
                            examination, found to be erroneous, and that the Cicerone was therefore
                            released. I give you this information, which is all this government has
                            received, with a desire that you shall communicate it to the Spanish
                            government, and assure them that if any error has been committed in the
                            transaction affecting the rights of Spain, this government will see that
                            it is duly repaired.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On account of my late absence from the
                            department of a few days, it has not been practicable for me to return
                            an earlier answer to your despatch of <pb facs="0129" n="105"
                                xml:id="pg_105"/> the 14th of October, (No. 131,) which was received
                            here on the 4th instant. I now hasten to inform you that I have
                            transmitted to Mr. Robinson, our minister at Lima, with an instruction
                            of which I enclose a transcript, a copy of your despatch. The hope is
                            confidently indulged that by the further exercise on the part of both
                            governments of a conciliatory disposition, a peaceful solution of the
                            question at issue may be reached. It has occurred to me, however, that
                            the period suggested by Mr. Llorente, during which Spain would be
                            willing to avoid all show of a hostile or menacing attitude towards
                            Peru, might well be extended in view of the length of time necessarily
                            consumed in communicating between points so distant as Madrid, this
                            capital, and Lima. You will, therefore, seek an early occasion to
                            suggest to Mr. Llorente the expediency of allowing, for the reason
                            stated, a longer term than that proposed by him in his conversation with
                            you.</p>

                            134, has been received. The question presented therein, as to what would
                            be the course of this government in regard to cargoes of guano consigned
                            to ports of the United States on Spanish account, is a grave one, but as
                            yet only a hypothetical one. The United States cannot anticipate its
                            actual occurrence, and must therefore completely reserve themselves upon
                            the subject. In the embarrassments, however, which must attend the
                            question, they find an additional motive for persevering in the friendly
                            counsel to both Spain and Peru to come to an accommodation of their
                            differences.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have received your despatch of November
                            24, No. 40, and I cannot too lavishly thank you for your careful and
                            lucid exposition of the Schleswig-Holstein question. Although,
                            fortunately, no responsibility rests upon this government to act, or
                            even to declare itself upon that controversy, it has, nevertheless, been
                            a subject of study on my part for some time. With the key you have put
                            into my hands I shall be able to interpret the action of the several
                            European powers in regard to the question, and form conclusions upon the
                            chances of peace and war in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the two leading maritime powers in regard to our civil
                            war has been recently relieved of some portion of its unfriendliness. It
                            yet remains, however, a cause of deep and serious concern. How singular
                            are the instructions Prance and England have given us for the regulation
                            of our conduct if war should unfortunately break out in Europe! In that
                            case, if we follow the example, what is to restrain us from recognizing
                            the war at once, and furnishing supplies, money, arms, material,
                            ships-of-war, and men, and the harborage of our ports to the
                            belligerents, however numerous and however friendly to ourselves they
                            may be, irrespective of the safety of their states, the merits of their
                            conflicts, or the commerce of the world? Even those powers, however,
                            which have dealt so unkindly with us must now perceive that there is an
                            irresistible logic of events which requires that Europeans shall confine
                            their rule to the eastern continent, and that the American states must
                            be left free to regulate political affairs within their own limits.</p>
                        <p>But if this claim is too broad, there is another that I think could not
                            be well contested. Let us suppose that Denmark should become a theatre
                            of civil war, and that Germany, and France, and Great Britain, and
                            Russia, although intervening by arms, should fail to enforce peace in
                            that unhappy state, in that case would any of the parties even then
                            tolerate interference, or even counsel, from the United States? May we
                            not derive from these circumstances, which disturb the European
                            governments, the instruction that it is the right of every <pb
                                facs="0132" n="108" xml:id="pg_108"/> nation to be rigidly left
                            alone to manage and regulate its own domestic affairs? If that principle
                            could be accepted by all the European states, would they not be at
                            liberty to reduce at once their respective armaments to the standard
                            prescribed by the necessity for guarding against civil war?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of December 1, No. 41, has
                            been received, and your careful and temperate survey of the political
                            field in Europe is appreciated.</p>
                        <p>At home the question first in practical importance is the renewal of our
                            army, rendered necessary by an early expiration of the first
                            enlistments. The process of renewal is successful.</p>
                        <p>The second question is that of reorganization in the insurrectionary
                            States. Not time enough has elapsed to enable us to judge whether the
                            plan suggested by the President will be generally adopted. It meets,
                            however, less opposition than the policy in regard to slaves announced
                            in the annual message of 1862–’63, and there is reason to hope that if
                            it shall not prove acceptable, it will open the way to some other plan
                            that will be at once feasible and satisfactory to the country. Major
                            General Butler reports that 8,000 citizens of Virginia, within the
                            military district under his command, have already taken the oath of
                            allegiance proposed in the President’s recent proclamation.</p>

                        <p>We are about beginning a new campaign. Enlistments are large, and the
                            popular spirit is loyal and earnest. Proofs come in from all quarters
                            that slavery will be cheerfully surrendered to the fate it has provoked.
                            There is no part of the insurrectionary region where a slave’s entire
                            valuation to day exceeds a year’s purchase as that property was rated
                            three years ago. Capital, of course, now avoids investment in slaves.
                            When slaves cease to be remunerative as property, they must immediately
                            become an incumbrance; they can no longer be an element of aristocratic
                            strength.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is with much pleasure that I
                            acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the 22d of February last. It
                            presents a very vivid picture of the public sentiment which existed at
                            Vienna at the moment of excitement produced by the success of the allies
                            in expelling the Danes from the chief strongholds in Schleswig. I shall
                            hold myself profoundly obliged by a continuation of your reports, until
                            some solution of the controversy between Germany and Denmark shall have
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing of especial interest to be communicated to you
                            concerning our affairs. Our forces are renewed and are in position.
                            Expeditions and skirmishes indicate the beginning of a campaign. The
                            late cavalry expedition of General Kilpatrick against Richmond was bold
                            and none the less entitled to admiration because it just failed to
                            accomplish the chivalrous result which was desired, rather than
                            expected.</p>
                        <p>General Sherman’s march through Mississippi was well rewarded with
                            captives and destruction of the insurgent’s munitions, supplies, and
                            arms. General Smith’s cavalry raid was proportionably effective.</p>
                        <p>The popular elections show a gratifying soundness of public opinion and
                            public virtue, while the amnesty offered by the President, coinciding
                            with the painful experience of the evils of sedition, seems to be
                            opening the way to a restoration of the authority of the Union.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It affords me much pleasure to express my
                            obligations to you for the explanations you have given me in your
                            despatch, No 47, of the causes which have moved the imperial royal
                            government to adopt restrictive military measures in Gallicia. It has
                            been difficult to decide here upon the just value of the rumors which
                            allege that the proceeding was taken upon false or frivolous pretences,
                            and with a design to recombine the so-called Holy Alliance.</p>
                        <p>I am not less indebted to you for your survey of the state of the war
                            existing between Germany and Denmark. Politicians are perplexed mainly
                            with three questions which arise out of that strange transaction. Will
                            Denmark consent to a dismemberment, perfect in all things, except in the
                            retaining of a union between the disputed provinces and Denmark proper,
                            through the person of the King as the sovereign of both? Will Austria
                            and Germany, after subjugating the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein,
                            restore them voluntarily to the King of Denmark? And third, will the
                            other European powers refrain from intervention? After making as careful
                            an examination of the facts as possible, and collating the conflicting
                            opinions of European statesmen, I confess that I think the solution of
                            each of these questions depends on contingencies that cannot now be
                            foreseen. What is seen is, that calm and conservative statesmen in
                            Europe earnestly desire a continuance of peace, and that, on the other
                            hand, revolutionary agencies have already been set in motion, which,
                            without concerted action that now seems impossible, cannot be
                            subdued.</p>
                        <pb facs="0134" n="110" xml:id="pg_110"/>
                        <p>Perhaps you think I ought to give you a survey of our political condition
                            in return for your interesting communication on that of Europe. But the
                            time has not arrived for performing that duty. We have had a season of
                            rest and invigoration. Although that season has passed, the new campaign
                            is only now beginning. It must suffice to say, that the government is
                            believed to be manifestly stronger and the insurrection manifestly
                            weaker than at any former period in the war. Our military men are
                            hopeful, and some advance in the work of reconstruction of the States
                            has been made.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>After preparing for the outgoing mail very
                            full despatches concerning Mexican affairs, I have just now received
                            your confidential despatch of March 28, which informs me of the grave
                            question that has arisen in the court of Vienna, concerning the effect
                            of the Archduke Maximilian’s acceptance of a crown in Mexico upon his
                            presumptive rights to succeed to the imperial royal throne of
                            Austria.</p>
                        <p>While I thank you very earnestly for this important information, I do not
                            think it necessary to comment upon it. The question thus raised will
                            probably have been in some way adjusted before this despatch will reach
                            its destination. The present policy of this government in regard to
                            Mexico would remain the same whether the archduke renounces or retains
                            his claim to the succession in Austria; and it does not seem probable
                            here that the ultimate destiny of Mexico can be influenced by anything
                            so merely individual and personal as the character or relations of the
                            person who at this new turn of the political wheel of that state may be
                            lifted up by one of its factions, aided by foreign power, to the seat of
                            Montezuma.</p>
                        <p>Nothing important has occurred here in regard to the position of the war.
                            There are raids, which merely indicate preparations for general
                            operations. A recent raid of the insurgents upon Fort Pillow, as is
                            said, has been marked by atrocities which cannot be contemplated without
                            a shudder. These barbarities assume very grave significance, as showing
                            that the Africo-American troops are to be denied by the insurgents when
                            victorious the privilege of quarter. So it seems to be established that
                            slavery claims its independence of civilization to the very last, even
                            while appealing to Christian nations for sympathy and aid.</p>
                        <p>I may say to you very confidentially that it is expected that a general
                            movement of the Union forces east of the Mississippi will begin before I
                            shall have an opportunity to write to you again.</p>

                            No. 59, and have read with profound interest the observations you have
                            made therein upon the politics of <pb facs="0135" n="111"
                                xml:id="pg_111"/> Austria and Prussia as they are influenced by the
                            war between them and Denmark. These observations are by no means less
                            valuable, because, while we are speculating concerning the probable
                            solution of the Schleswig-Holstein affair, the conference in London is
                            proceeding to determine the solution certainly independently of all that
                            may be thought or said by those who are not directly concerned in the
                            matter. The United States are suffering much injustice at the hands of
                            some of the European powers. In endeavoring to ascertain what we may
                            have to expect hereafter at the hands of these powers in the
                            vicissitudes of our own civil war, it is necessary to understand as well
                            as we may be able what is likely to be the occupation of these powers
                            respectively, and their relations towards each other in the field, when
                            the interest of self-preservation obliges them to assume great
                            responsibilities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have received with sincere pleasure your
                            despatch of June 18, No. 61. I sympathize with you, as the whole
                            American people do, in the grief and sorrow which you express on the
                            occasion of the death of General Wadsworth. He was an eminent type of
                            the sublime virtue which is saving and regenerating the republic. There
                            is scarcely a family in the country which has not been bereaved, and you
                            may therefore be sure of universal sympathy when you mourn for one near
                            to yourself who was stricken down upon the battle-field.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I thank you for your suggestions concerning Mexico, and the probable
                            influence of recent events in that country upon our relations with
                            Austria. These are consequences of our civil war, and they cannot be
                            controlled. All that can be done in regard to them is to practice
                            prudence and good faith in our foreign relations, and at the same time
                            make preparations for self defence, if, notwithstanding our best
                            efforts, we shall find ourselves involved in new complications. Neither
                            is our political system weak, nor does it stand on an uncertain
                            foundation. We must, indeed, do all that we can to fortify, as well as
                            to defend it; but we may not unwisely indulge an abiding confidence in
                            its inherent strength and stability.</p>

                            long an acknowledgment of your very interesting despatch of the 14th of
                            August, No. 71.</p>
                        <p>Without discussing the merits or the political points of the recent war
                                <pb facs="0136" n="112" xml:id="pg_112"/> between the two great
                            German states and Denmark, we may be allowed to rejoice that the war
                            itself is at an end, and that Europe is at peace. The public mind reads
                            recent events as indicative of a return of peace also on this continent.
                            I think, however, that consummation is not to be immediately expected.
                            Of course I do not at all believe that in our approaching election the
                            people will command the government to surrender, or forego the integrity
                            of the Union, the great object of the contest on our part. On the other
                            hand, it is hardly to be expected either that the insurgents will
                            abandon their efforts or be deserted by the people they have misled,
                            until a further blow is delivered against their yet formidable military
                            organization. We are preparing to give that blow.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of the 29th of August, No.
                            72, has been received.</p>
                        <p>In acknowledging the receipt of the information I have given you
                            concerning military events in previous despatches, you remark that there
                            is a further illustration of the subject of which you have so often
                            spoken in the fact that my despatch of the 1st of August did not reach
                            you until after telegraphic fragments, such as they were, up to the 10th
                            of August, had been printed in the journals of Vienna.</p>
                        <p>This observation is a just one, but you will excuse me for saying that
                            the fact equally illustrates a position I have heretofore taken, that
                            reliable official despatches from this capital will always be
                            anticipated by unofficial telegraphic despatches, such as they are, in
                            the European press. This department must wait and verify facts before
                            communicating them. Irresponsible reporters give rumors as they rise,
                            and leave the public to correct them.</p>
                        <p>I have been well aware of the expectations which our European enemies
                            have been building upon the delays of our military operations, and upon
                            the plottings of insurrectionary emissaries with doubtful patriots at
                            Niagara. Indeed, what was said and thought and expected in Europe, was
                            first said and thought and expected by a large class of our countrymen
                            at home. All this seems now to be changed. The military campaign proves
                            a success; and the political plot begins to be regarded as a weak and
                            harmless invention.</p>
                        <p>We may, perhaps, accept the fact, that the public attention on both sides
                            of the military line is engaged here, as well as throughout Europe, by
                            earnest expectations of peace, as an indication that peace is
                            approaching. Indeed, this intense and general expectation must have
                            large effect in producing peace.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me not less clear that the peace which is to come is one in
                            which the integrity of the Union shall be saved. Because, first, it is
                            only the political pressure of the Union upon the insurgents that could
                            have brought them back, even indirectly, into the old way of attempting
                            to regulate the elections of the country; and because, secondly, however
                            they may fail in these attempts to regulate with a view to their own
                            unlawful purposes, they will find it difficult to recede so far from
                            this new and false position as to reassume their attitude of
                            independence and sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>I do not pursue my speculations beyond this point, because the whole
                            future policy of the government seems to me to be depending upon the
                            popular elections to be held in November; and I could not discuss the
                            probabilities of that canvass <pb facs="0137" n="113" xml:id="pg_113"/>
                            in this correspondence without at least seeming to be influenced by
                            partisanship.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the interesting information you have given me concerning
                            the Schleswig-Holstein question.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>You will probably have learned, before the
                            arrival of this instruction, of the sudden and unexpected death, at New
                            York, of Count Giorgi. Immediately upon the receipt of the sad
                            intelligence here, instructions were sent by telegraph to the United
                            States attorney at New York, requesting him to offer his services and
                            sympathy on the occasion to Mr. Loosey, the consul general, and
                            informing him that all the principal government officers in New York
                            would be expected to attend the funeral. These instructions were fully
                            and acceptably carried out, as will be perceived from the accompanying
                            copy of a letter from the United States attorney dated the 11th instant.
                            The obsequies, which were of the most imposing character, were attended
                            by most of the members of the diplomatic body, the foreign consuls at
                            New York, the principal government officials, and by many of our most
                            distinguished private citizens.</p>
                        <p>It will be proper for you to express to Count Rechberg in a fitting
                            manner the profound regret which has been occasioned by the death of
                            Count Giorgi, who was held in the highest estimation by all who knew him
                            during his brief residence in the United States.</p>

                            political condition of Europe. Military action there seems to have given
                            place to speculation, which fortunately is not intense enough to
                            withdraw the attention of states from the improvements of their
                            financial and social condition. In pursuing that important interest they
                            all will have the sympathy and good will of the United states, and to no
                            state will such sentiments be extended more cheerfully or more sincerely

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Since the date of my despatch of last week,
                            No. 33, I have had an interview with Count Rechberg. Nothing, however,
                            has up to this moment been decided in regard to the expected offer of
                            the proposed Mexican throne to the Archduke Maximilian. The affair, so
                            far as the imperial royal government is concerned, remains as before.
                            The deputation from Mexico is expected in the course of this week to
                            arrive at Miramare, the archduke’s residence near Trieste.</p>
                        <p>I could not learn from the minister what conditions would be laid down by
                            the archduke as necessary preliminaries to his acceptance of the crown,
                            but I understood him to say that no binding arrangement would be
                            concluded with this deputation, although it would probably be
                            received.</p>
                        <p>I understood him, also, to repeat, as often before, that the Austrian
                            government considered the matter as a purely personal one, regarding the
                            archduke himself and his imperial brother only, and that the imperial
                            royal government had not the means nor the inclination to send out
                            forces to Mexico to maintain the new empire.</p>
                        <p>I do not think it worth while to report any of the observations which I
                            unofficially made on the subject myself, and which were simply those
                            which any loyal American, belonging to any section or party of the
                            United States, would be always sure to make in regard to this
                            overturning of a republic, and the substitution for it of a monarchical
                            government on American soil, and upon our frontier, by means of foreign
                            armies and navies.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that public opinion does not need much enlightenment as to
                            the effect likely to be produced upon the people of the United States by
                            this European armed intervention in the affairs of an American republic.
                            I suppose that the French emperor is hardly acting in ignorance of
                            American opinions and feelings, but in defiance of them, and that the
                            archduke in going forth upon this adventure to improve imperial
                            institutions upon the ruins of a democratic republic, can hardly have
                            failed of weighing all the possible consequences of such a step, and
                            that he is not likely to have reckoned on the sympathy and support of
                            the United States government and people.</p>
                        <p>I intimated to Count Rechberg that there were rumors of the impending
                            recognition of the so-called southern confederacy by the provisional
                            government <pb facs="0139" n="115" xml:id="pg_115"/> now established in
                            the city of Mexico; I understood him to reply that the Austrian
                            government knew no such provisional government, and that a communication
                            which had been received from that source had not been and would not be
                            answered.</p>
                        <p>I alluded also to the daily rumors in the European journals of intrigues
                            and secret understandings between the agents of the insurgent government
                            in the seceded States and the Emperor Napoleon, in which recognition of
                            that organization as an independent power by France was announced for
                            the immediate future, coupled with cession of territory so far as such
                            agents had the power to cede it to the new Mexican empire, as the price
                            of French recognition and French alliance. He said that the archduke
                            held himself aloof from all such intrigues. In regard to the expected
                            recognition by the new Mexican empire of the so-called confederacy, he
                            observed that it would be easy for the United States government in a
                            moment to make such a step impossible.</p>
                        <p>If the United States should themselves recognize the new government of
                            Mexico, of course such recognition by so important a power would be far
                            more valuable than any political relations that might be established
                            with the southern States. He observed that everybody knew that the
                            previous attacks upon Mexico and the disposition to extend the United
                            States dominion over the soil of that country had always proceeded from
                            the south.</p>
                        <p>I answered, that the recognition by the United States government of this
                            new empire seemed to me impossible. Instead, however, of saying anything
                            more upon this topic myself, my personal opinions and feelings having
                            been often enough and strongly enough expressed, I proposed reading to
                            him your despatch to Mr. Dayton, of March 3, 1862, which, so far as I
                            knew, had never been published, but of which a copy had been forwarded
                            to me at the time, and which I had brought with me. He readily assented,
                            expressing at the same time a strong respect for yourself and your
                            character as a statesman. I thought it could certainly do no harm that
                            the Austrian government should be in possession of so wise and temperate
                            a statement of American thought on that all-important subject, and
                            accordingly, after reading the paper, I took the responsibility of
                            promising a copy, which has subsequently been communicated to the
                            imperial royal foreign office.</p>
                        <p>If I have done wrong in this you will let me know. I thought it might
                            have some effect in causing reflection at this critical moment, and I
                            relied on an observation in one of your despatches to me, that our
                            government has no concealment in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I think you will hardly wish me to enter into academic or prophetic
                            speculations upon this grave incident in our history. You are informed
                            of the exact relations between the United States and France, while I am
                            necessarily in the dark.</p>
                        <p>Rumors, suspicions, threats, in regard to the attitude of that power
                            towards us fill the atmosphere of Europe. It seems impossible to doubt
                            that the tendencies and sympathies of the French government are towards
                            the slaveholders’ insurrection, and that a recognition of the so-called
                            confederacy is an ever-impending event.</p>
                        <p>Since the revelations of the British Parliament by Messrs. Roebuck and
                            Lindsay, it would be folly to doubt the feelings of the ruler of France.
                            At present the see-saw of his policy between Poland on the one side and
                            Mexico on the other seems to incline towards our side of the world.</p>
                        <p>The diplomatic correspondence between the three powers and Russia seems
                            to have come to an end for this year, and it can hardly be said that the
                            Czar’s government has sustained a defeat in the encounter. Meantime the
                            Poles, in their struggles for independence, have been for nearly a year
                            in vain supplicating the great powers for that recognition as
                            belligerents which was so very promptly conceded, at the very outbreak
                            of the revolt, to the insurgent slaveholders in the United States. This
                            is a fact which history will forever hold fast.</p>
                        <pb facs="0140" n="116" xml:id="pg_116"/>
                        <p>The Poles are left to fight single-handed and naked as it were against
                            the whole power of Russia, for a winter’s campaign in that direction on
                            the part of France alone is hardly among the probabilities. The Gulf of
                            Mexico seems more tempting at present, and you are better aware than I
                            am how much or how little danger there is of that last chance of the
                            insurgents, a foreign war against the United States. I am sure that the
                            President will avoid such war with any power so long as the national
                            honor and the national safety will permit.</p>
                        <p>I observe this morning a single paragraph in a widely circulated Vienna
                            newspaper which is worthy of your attention. It is in an article
                            defending the probable acceptance by the archduke of the Mexican crown.
                            “According to latest accounts from Mexico it is hardly to be doubted
                            that all inner discord in Mexico will come to an end so soon as the
                            archduke shall tread its soil. * * * Also, the French government is
                            supposed to have arranged with the American southern States for the
                            cession of Texas. It is confidently assumed that the overwhelmingly
                            German population of Texas would readily submit themselves to a German
                            prince. It is apparently not feared that in consequence of this cession
                            a war would arise between France and North America; should, however, the
                            north of America, besides the still-continuing contest with the
                            confederates, be willing to burden themselves with such a war in
                            addition, then France would not object, perhaps even wish for it, in
                            order at least to be able to interfere with armed force in favor of the
                            south.”</p>
                        <p>This is in a journal which is generally supposed—I know not how justly—to
                            be “inspired” occasionally by government. Of what use, then, would be
                            talk or argumentation on our side as to Mexican politics, if such views
                            could find general acceptance?</p>
                        <p>Whether the Germans in Texas, who probably did not emigrate from their
                            fatherland because fanatically attached to monarchical institutions, are
                            grown so disloyal to their adopted country as is here represented, you
                            can judge better than I can. My impression has been that they were not
                            only strong and sincere democrats, but on account of their warm
                            attachment to the United States government they had suffered much
                            persecution from the. insurgents. But under whose authority has Texas
                            been ceded to France? Even were the insurgent government in as
                            triumphant as it is really in desperate circumstances, on what theory
                            and by what machinery is Texas to be ceded?</p>
                        <p>At least an ordinance of secession out of the confederacy, on the part of
                            the State government, might be thought necessary, or it is supposed that
                            the government at Richmond has spare troops enough at its disposal
                            beyond the Mississippi to deliver over Texas, bound hand and foot, to
                            the new Emperor. Cessions in the Nice and Savoy fashion are not so
                            easily accomplished in our hemisphere. Of course, the Emperor Napoleon,
                            or any foreign potentate, is competent to attempt the conquest of Texas
                            or of any other United States territory with with or without “an
                            arrangement with the southern States,” but it would certainly be
                            something new in the history of the world that the conquest of such a
                            province, 237,000 square miles in extent, and with a population of
                            600,000, the acquisition of which has cost a war, besides $10,000,000 in
                            money, should be effected without the inconvenience of a new war.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I should say, although I am unable to give you
                            authentically the conditions to be laid down previous to the acceptance
                            of the transatlantic crown by the archduke, that this will undoubtedly
                            include a goodly number of French bayonets for a considerable number of
                            years, a recognition of the throne by France and England at least, and
                            some more substantial manifestations of Mexican opinion in regard to the
                            proposed revolution of the government than the shadowy phenomena which
                            have thus far been visible.</p>
                        <p>I should say, also, that this whole matter is an embarrassment to the
                            imperial <pb facs="0141" n="117" xml:id="pg_117"/> royal government.
                            Offence might be given to France should her fatal present be refused,
                            while acceptance can bring no possible good to Austria.</p>
                        <p>“Timeo Danaos etiam dona ferentes” is, I suspect, the secret thought of
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch, No. 41, of date September 11, marked
                            confidential, in which information is conveyed to me as to the attitude
                            of the United States government in regard to the war now existing
                            between the empire of France and the republic of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I understand from the latter portion of the despatch that the
                            representatives of the United States abroad are instructed not to engage
                            in the political debates which the present unsettled aspect of the war
                            in Mexico has elicited. Hitherto I have occasionally deemed it my duty,
                            in my private and unofficial capacity, to give expression to the almost
                            universal American sentiment as to the events in question, and as to the
                            misfortunes which have come upon a republic, our nearest neighbor,
                            through the invasion of a distant and powerful nation. Of course, I have
                            never engaged in any political debates, as I am fully aware that the
                            United States government has never, directly or indirectly, authorized
                            me to that effect.</p>
                        <p>I have thought, however, that it might be useful for the department to be
                            informed, from time to time, of what might transpire as to the candidacy
                            of the Archduke Maximilian for the throne which it is proposed to erect
                            in Mexico, or in that part of the republic which has been subdued by the
                            armies of the French Emperor.</p>
                        <p>I regret that my last despatch, No. 35, conveyed incorrect information.
                            Although I stated that the source of that information was not official,
                            nor such as I could vouch for, while I relied myself on its correctness,
                            yet I should not have transmitted it at all, except for strong reasons
                            for my faith not now necessary to indicate.</p>
                        <p>At any rate, unless there has been some sudden change in the plans of the
                            archduke, which I have no reason to suppose, it is obvious that the
                            information was erroneous; for it now appears from the answer of his
                            Imperial Highness to the deputation of “notables,” a translation of
                            which is herewith transmitted, that his ultimate acceptance of the
                            offered crown is very problematical. The conditions laid down are such
                            as have been intimated in all my previous despatches, excepting No. 35,
                            and would seem very difficult of fulfilment. One would suppose, for
                            instance, although it is not distinctly stated, that among the
                            guarantees, that of England would be included, and it is difficult to
                            imagine that this could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>As to Poland, and the probable results of the insurrection there, I see
                            no reason to change the opinion hitherto expressed in this
                            correspondence. A continuation of epistolary polemics between the three
                            powers on one side and Russia on the other, would seem impossible after
                            the last note from St. Petersburg, <pb facs="0142" n="118"
                                xml:id="pg_118"/> and I have not Beard of any intention on the part
                            of the three powers to render any material aid to the insurgent
                            Poles.</p>
                        <p>It is the universal opinion that peace between the four powers in
                            question will be preserved for this year at least. A winter’s campaign
                            in the Baltic would hardly be practicable for France alone. There has
                            been a talk of conferring belligerent rights on the insurgent Poles, as
                            was done in the case of our insurgent slaveholders at the outbreak of
                            their revolt; but this measure would have little effect unless it should
                            be consented to by the great states bordering upon Poland—Austria and
                            Prussia; and this consent I should consider impossible. It is true that
                            the measure might enable Englishmen to build, equip, and man
                            vessels-of-war, to sail from English ports, in order, under the Polish
                            flag, to burn and rob Russian merchant ships on the high seas; but it is
                            possible that the czar might not acquiesce in the doctrine maintained by
                            some of the politicians and jurisconsults of England, that such
                            practices are consistent with neutrality and international law. It is
                            not easy to see, therefore, what practical service any proclamation in
                            favor of the Poles would effect, unless the powers nearest the seat of
                            war should unite in the measure.</p>
                        <p>In regard to our own affairs I should say that a considerable change had
                            come over public opinion in Europe. It is no longer accepted as a fact,
                            not to be gainsaid, that the so called confederacy of the slaveholders
                            has a real existence; on the contrary, there is a prevalent feeling that
                            an insurrection of individuals, although more formidable for its
                            numbers, its courage, and the military and political skill with which
                            its combinations have been directed, and the wide territory over which
                            its influence was spread, is slowly but surely yielding before the arms
                            and the policy of a great and free commonwealth, and this feeling does
                            not diminish the respect with which our republic, despite the efforts of
                            domestic traitors and foreign calumniators and intriguers, is regarded
                            in Europe. When the dark days are over, and peace and union are restored
                            to our distracted land, the American people, I trust, while it will be
                            difficult for them to forget the efforts of their foreign traducers to
                            injure as noble a cause as any for which mankind has ever sacrificed
                            blood or treasure, will be still more sure to remember their friends. If
                            it be noble to have maintained, at the expense of so many precious
                            lives, the existence of our free republic, and to have insured the
                            emancipation of an oppressed and deeply injured race, it will be doubly
                            grateful for us to remember that, when the clouds were heaviest, the
                            masses of those populations supposed to be most interested in the
                            success of the slaveholding confederacy never faltered in their sympathy
                            with the efforts of the free republic. The heroic attitude of the
                            working classes of England, steadily withstanding the arts and
                            misrepresentations of demagogues, will ever be cherished as a
                            manifestation scarcely less sublime than the heroism with which
                            Americans of all classes have been ready to lay down their lives that
                            their own country might live; nor shall we ever forget that the
                            journalists who have defended our cause among a host of enemies have
                            been unsurpassed in the whole history of the periodical press, for
                            knowledge, ability, and elevation of sentiment; that some of the most
                            eloquent and honored of the public men of England have spoken words
                            which have echoed in every American heart; and that the loftiest and
                            most earnest thinkers both of England and the continent, the true and
                            permanent guides of public thought, with scarce an exception, have
                            expressed themselves in regard to the great revolution now going on in
                            America with a wisdom and breadth of vision that do honor to the
                            age.</p>
                        <p>In this empire, as I have more than once had the pleasure of stating,
                            there have been no malevolent manifestations at any period. The points
                            of political contact between us are not many, but the world of thought
                            has no boundaries. If there has been any calumny or misrepresentation by
                            the press of Vienna, it has entirely escaped my notice; while, on the
                            other hand, the general tone of journalism has been respectful, and
                            often very sympathetic. The ability and <pb facs="0143" n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119"/> knowledge of the public writers here, in dealing
                            with foreign affairs, and especially with American matters, is very
                            remarkable.</p>

                            <p>The Mexican deputation was received to-day by his imperial royal
                                highness the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian. The archduke answered
                                the address of the deputation:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi>I am deeply touched by the wishes
                                which were expressed by the assembly of notables at Mexico, at their
                                sitting of the 10th June, and which you have been charged to bring
                                to me. It can only be flattering for our house that, at the first
                                mention of the word monarchy, the eyes of your countrymen were at
                                once turned to the race of Charles V. Although the task of assuring
                                the independence and well-being of Mexico, by means of durable and
                                free institutions, is a very noble one, still I must acknowledge, in
                                full understanding with his majesty the Emperor of the French, whose
                                glorious initiative makes the regeneration of your beautiful country
                                possible, that the monarchy cannot be restored, on legitimate and
                                lasting foundations, unless the whole nation, of its own free will,
                                ratifies the wish of the capital. Therefore, I must make my
                                acceptance of the throne which is offered to me depend, first, on
                                the result of a vote of the entire country. On the other hand, my
                                comprehension of the sacred duties of the ruler over the restored
                                empire makes it necessary for me to ask for those guarantees which
                                are indispensable to protect it from the dangers which threaten its
                                integrity and independence. Should the assurances of a well-grounded
                                security in the future be obtained, and should the universal choice
                                of the noble Mexican people fall upon me, I shall be ready to accept
                                the throne, supported by the acquiescence of the high chief of my
                                family, and confiding in the protection of the Almighty. In case
                                that I should be called by Providence to the high mission of
                                civilization connected with this crown, I must, gentlemen, declare
                                to you, even now, my firm determination, following the wise example
                                of my imperial brother, to open to the country the path of progress
                                founded on law and order, by means of a constitutional government,
                                and as soon as the whole realm has been restored to peace, to seal
                                the fundamental fact with the nation by my oath. Only in this way
                                could a new and truly national policy be called into life, in which
                                all parties, forgetting their ancient enmities, would help to raise
                                Mexico to that conspicuous rank among the nations to which she would
                                seem to be destined under a government which held as its highest
                                principle to let moderation and law govern.</p>
                            <p>Gentlemen, will you communicate to your countrymen these resolutions,
                                which I have freely imparted to you, and strive that it may be made
                                possible to the nation to declare what government it wishes to see
                                established.</p>

                            <p>The consuls of the United States of North America, in Venice and
                                Trieste— the former under date October 28 and November 19, the
                                latter November 17, 1862—have notified the imperial royal
                                stadtholdership in Venice and the imperial royal central authorities
                                in Trieste, respectively, that a new law of the United States
                                empowers ships-of-war of such foreign countries as will reciprocate
                                the favor, in certain cases therein specified, to purchase stores in
                                the public magazines of the ports of the United States, free from
                                any tax or duty whatever; and at the same time have inquired whether
                                in the Austrian ports, lying within the jurisdiction of the said
                                consular functionaries, ships-of-war belonging to the United States
                                were already enjoying this privilege, or whether it would be allowed
                                in future?</p>
                            <p>In relation to the said notice, the imperial royal foreign office has
                                the honor, after due consultation with the proper imperial royal
                                central authority, to communicate to the honorable legation of the
                                United States and to place at its disposal the following
                                information:</p>
                            <p>In the Austrian ports there are no public magazines from which ships
                                obtain supplies.</p>
                            <p>As Venice, Trieste, Fiume, Buccari, Porto Re, and Zeugg are in fact
                                free ports, and therefore lie outside the Austrian tariff limits, of
                                course stores can be obtained in them free of duties. In the other
                                Austrian ports all the freely marketable articles used for ships’
                                stores are either Austrian or foreign productions; in the latter
                                case they have already been taxed upon their importation into the
                                tariff territory, and consequently are subjected to no further tax
                                when they are taken on board ship—that is, out of the tariff
                                territory—since no export duties are payable upon articles of food,
                                drink, &amp;c. Even productions of foreign origin, which in transitu
                                are temporarily stored in the magazines of the customs, are only
                                subjected to a small rate for storage as a remuneration for the use
                                of the official warehouses at the time when they are removed and
                                transported over the tariff boundaries, or on board a ship as
                                stores, transit duties having been abolished in Austria. In adding
                                the request that the honorable legation will transmit the
                                information herein imparted to the government of the United States,
                                the undersigned embraces the opportunity to renew to the same the
                                assurance of his most perfect consideration.</p>

                            receipt of your despatches, Nos. 45, 46, 47, and 48, of dates October 9,
                            20, 23, and 23, together with a copy of your despatch of date 23d
                            October, 1863, addressed to Mr. Dayton.</p>
                        <pb facs="0145" n="121" xml:id="pg_121"/>
                        <p>This paper I took the earliest opportunity to place in the hands of Count
                            Rechberg, at an interview a few days ago. He read it through with great
                            attention, and then observed that it seemed to him a very moderate and
                            statesmanlike despatch.</p>
                        <p>He asked if I would leave it with him, but as you had only instructed me
                            to “make the contents known” to him, I did not consider myself justified
                            in so doing, because of the confidential nature of the document, and
                            because it was addressed not to me, but to our minister in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Our conversation on the matter was brief. He repeated what he had often
                            said before, that the imperial government held itself aloof from the
                            whole affair. Austria was a continental power, not a maritime power of
                            the first magnitude, and could, therefore, send no ships or armies to
                            Mexico to sustain the proposed empire.</p>
                        <p>I understood him to remark that it was hardly to be expected that the
                            people or government of the United States would regard with sympathy the
                            reappearance of a monarchical form of government in their neighborhood,
                            but that, on the other hand, the right of Mexico to decide as to its own
                            form of government was not to be disputed.</p>
                        <p>I replied that this right was the leading principle of all our policy,
                            but that a real decision of a nation as to its form of government could
                            never be made in the presence of foreign armies and navies.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then passed to other topics.</p>
                        <p>I suppose that there is no doubt of the archduke’s expectation to leave
                            for Mexico before next summer.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I beg to call your attention to a debate
                            in the Austrian Reichsrath, a translation of which is herewith
                            transmitted. The speeches of the two Gallician deputies, and the replies
                            of Ministers Schmerling and Mesery, will give you a better view of the
                            condition of things in Austrian Poland and of the attitude of the
                            imperial government in the provinces, than could be furnished by any
                            dissertation that I could write. You will judge for yourself of the
                            probability of the imperial government ever joining with France, or any
                            other power, in a war against Russia, in behalf of Poland, or of her
                            even conferring belligerent rights on insurgents so close to her own
                            frontier. Without the consent of Austria, of course any attempt to
                            elevate them to the rank of belligerents would be futile.</p>
                        <p>The general impression in these regions is that the insurrection in
                            Russian Poland is nearly exhausted. In the battles and skirmishes which
                            have occurred of late, the Poles have been almost invariably defeated,
                            and the entire downfall of their hopes of foreign assistance is fast
                            reducing them to despair.</p>
                        <p>It is not thought that much service has been rendered to the cause of
                            liberty or human progress by the vehement speeches and able despatches
                            which the insurrection has called forth from other lands in profusion,
                            while material aid was denied. Meantime, the proposition for a European
                            congress has for a time stretched a veil over the terrible scenes of
                            which that unhappy land has so long been the theatre, and which till
                            recently absorbed the attention of Europe. <pb facs="0146" n="122"
                                xml:id="pg_122"/> Now the world is busy discussing the project of a
                            congress, and it is useless to comment upon the dexterity with which
                            this proposition was so unexpectedly and dramatically presented, and the
                            suddenness with which the Polish question has been transferred to the
                            background. It is the common opinion that before this congress meets, if
                            it ever should meet, Russia will have suppressed the Polish rebellion;
                            but I have not heard of any other practical result that is even expected
                            from the project.</p>
                        <p>So far as regards Austria, the dominant feeling is a desire for peace.
                            During the past year considerable progress had been made on the new
                            constitutional career of the empire. The wall of passive resistance had
                            been breached in Transylvania, from which province the full quota of
                            deputies, twenty-three (23) in number, had been but recently sent to the
                            Reichsrath, and there were hopes that Croatia would follow the example,
                            while even in Hungary there were symptoms of weariness and of a desire
                            for reconciliation. The funds were gradually improving, a new loan had
                            been negotiated on favorable terms, (at about par in paper currency,)
                            and the agio on specie had fallen to nine or ten per cent.</p>
                        <p>The speech of the French Emperor has effected a sudden change in this
                            sunny aspect of affairs. The commercial world has taken fright, and
                            believes that nothing but war can come out of the congress, or out of a
                            rejection of it. The funds are steadily falling, and the agio on silver
                            has already reached 23 per cent., and people go about, both in the
                            diplomatic world and outside of it, telling each other the most alarming
                            stories.</p>
                        <p>Thus, if England and Austria should refuse to attend the proposed
                            areopagus at Paris, then France, Italy, Russia, and Prussia would meet
                            and remodel the map of Europe—that favorite pastime of politicians and
                            potentates. France would, of course, be accommodated with the Rhine, and
                            Prussia would be compensated with Hanover Brunswick, and other pieces of
                            property, to round off her domains. Italy would come into possession of
                            Venetia, and Russia would be allowed to take possession of the Danubian
                            principalities, and thus find herself further advanced towards
                            Constantinople than before the Crimean war. Austria would be the victim,
                            for it would be impossible for England, who has no army for continental
                            purposes, to afford her any assistance.</p>
                        <p>These and many similar stories are repeated glibly from mouth to mouth,
                            and there are even people found who believe in them. I give them to you
                            as part of the gossip of the hour.</p>
                        <p>Meantime this government does not refuse the congress as a principle, but
                            utterly rejects the proposition made so prominent in the French
                            Emperor’s speech, and received in the chamber with such enthusiasm, that
                            the treaties of 1815 have ceased to exist. On the contrary, the treaties
                            of Vienna are regarded here, not only as existing, but as the foundation
                            of the public law and political geography of Europe, so far as they have
                            not been modified by subsequent events. This is not dissimilar to the
                            view taken, as I understand, by England. Neither Austria nor England
                            will refuse the congress, but they will insist beforehand that a
                            programme should be laid down of the measures likely to be discussed.
                            This, for a variety of reasons, would seem a difficult task, for I am
                            not aware that any power proposes to give up any portion of its own
                            territory for the common good, nor to permit any intervention in its own
                            private affairs. The public is rather inclined to expect, as the result
                            of the proposition of the 5th November, a series of barren conferences,
                            to be followed, perhaps, by war, or perhaps war without any conferences
                            at all.</p>
                        <p>Meantime public attention is directed from unhappy Poland, and Paris is
                            amused.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p rend="center">FORTY-THIRD SESSION OF THE HOUSE OF DEPUTIES.</p>
                        <p>In the session of the deputies to-day the budget of the minister of
                            police came up for discussion. Two speakers of the Polish faction
                            embraced the opportunity to discourse upon the condition of things in
                            Gallicia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Dietl.</hi>In the seventeenth session he and his
                            political friends touched! generally upon the illegal acts of which
                            various executive officers, especially in connexion with Polish affairs,
                            have been guilty in Gallicia. At that time the minister of police
                            replied that not a single fact was produced as a basis of the charge.
                            Now, in this reply of the Polish minister lay a challenge, and this the
                            speaker to-day accepts, and declares that he and the members of his
                            party, on the first of the month, placed in the hands of the minister of
                            state a memorial upon the illegalities in Gallicia, to which document
                            were appended, in ample numbers, the facts not produced on the former
                            occasion. This memorial presents essentially five subjects of complaint,
                            which, in the main, are matters relating to the police, viz: illegal
                            arrests, illegal house-searches, encroachments of the imperial military
                            and gens d’armerie, the employment of peasants as guards and assistants
                            at house-searches in the country, and inhuman conduct on the part of
                            executive officials.</p>
                        <p>After having proved by such facts that justice in Gallicia has been
                            variously and seriously invaded, it is then shown that these infractions
                            of the law can be justified neither by the bearing of the population,
                            which is in all respects peaceful and loyal, nor by international
                            considerations; for state laws, when not expressly declared inoperative,
                            must under all circumstances retain their efficacy and be obeyed by the
                            organs of government. It is finally intimated in the memorial that since
                            the illegalities in Gallicia can be justified neither through the
                            conduct of the people nor from international considerations, these acts
                            can have foundation in no other motive than the intention of making in
                            Gallicia common cause with Russia in repressing the Polish insurrection,
                            but that such a complicity with Russia stands in the strangest contrast
                            to the position which the government has assumed upon the Polish
                            question in common with the western powers. Based upon the facts so
                            presented, the petition was offered, “that justice, thus invaded in
                            Gallicia on the part of the officials, be restored through the checks
                            imposed by the laws relating to personal freedom and house-right; that
                            humane conduct be strictly enjoined upon the imperial officials, and
                            especially upon those intrusted with arrests and house-searches; that
                            the employment of the police be not allowed to the military, but
                            intrusted only to authorities legally constituted for this purpose; and
                            that, finally, peasant guards and an organized peasant police be given
                            up, and for the future be most strictly forbidden.”</p>
                        <p>Now, up to this moment no answer has been vouchsafed to this memorial—
                            nay, not a hint in relation to what has become of it. He (the speaker)
                            and his political friends see themselves under the necessity of offering
                            to the police minister the well-grounded petition, that the action of
                            the police in Gallicia may be regulated in the sense of the memorial in
                            such a manner that it may correspond to the demands of the law and
                            humanity.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">V. Schmerling</hi>, minister of state. The gentlemen
                            deputies to the Reichsrath from Gallicia have in fact, as just now
                            stated by the last speaker, handed me a memorial which treats upon these
                            asserted illegal assumptions of power which during some months past have
                            taken place on the part of executive officials in Gallicia. I have given
                            this memorial an attentive examination, which has led <pb facs="0148"
                                n="124" xml:id="pg_124"/> to further action upon it, in conjunction
                            with my honored colleagues the ministers of police and justice, and
                            precisely this attentive examination of the memorial has afforded me the
                            comforting assurance that on the part of the imperial authorities, in
                            the face of just such a condition of things as has now for nearly a year
                            existed in Gallicia, their course has in fact been one of great
                            moderation. For if, under the circumstances which in fact now prevail,
                            it is only shown that a number of the inferior executive officials have,
                            perhaps, here and there in particular cases, somewhat overstepped the
                            strict forms of the law, this must certainly be called, on the part of
                            the authorities, a thoroughly satisfactory attitude. I have to-day no
                            call to go into details upon the condition of things in Gallicia. I
                            should have no difficulty in laying before the house a mass of documents
                            which exhibit, in the clearest light, the views of a certain party in
                            Gallicia, I need not produce these documents. Those gentlemen who only
                            read the newspapers are, I have no doubt, sufficiently informed how it
                            is in general with this very highly loyal attitude in Gallicia; I say in
                            general, because I gladly admit that the great majority in Gallicia are
                            opposed to the doings of this party. Without declaring what course the
                            government really intends to take in respect to these events in
                            Gallicia, and whether its efforts are really intended to aid the Russian
                            government in repressing the insurrection in Russian Poland, I confine
                            myself to the simple declaration that what the imperial government is
                            now doing in Gallicia has this for its object, viz: the repression of a
                            revolution in that dependency of the crown, the object of which is in
                            the end to separate Gallicia from the imperial state. (Applause in the
                            centre and on the left.)</p>
                        <p>Deputy Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Zyblikiewioz</hi>opposed the assertion of
                            the minister that the authorities in Gallicia had executed the laws with
                            great moderation, and said: It is a legal condition of things in
                            Gallicia that during the past half year nightly visitations have been
                            made, as in the time of the French revolution; that the bed-rooms of the
                            women have not been spared; that their bed-clothes have been stripped
                            from them, and they driven half naked from their beds; that their
                            mattresses have been tumbled up and down, as though to find recruits
                            against Russia under them, as did actually take place in the Solnowsky
                            house with the wife of a citizen; that in such visitations
                            bloodhounds—as in the American style against negroes—have been brought
                            into the houses, as was the case not long since in Count Wodjicke’s
                            house in Cracow! Is that a legal condition, when a man in his own
                            neighborhood does not go out of his own room into the street without
                            taking a card of identification? Is it a legal transaction when, as was
                            the case last Thursday in Lemberg, the entrances to a coffee-house are
                            beset with bayonets, when the police pushes into the halls and examines
                            the visitors there, and drags away whomsoever it pleases? Is that a
                            legal condition of things, when young people dare not come out of the
                            cellars, like the early Christians in the time of Diocletian; when in
                            the garden of Count Potocki a gun was fired at his cousin, as she was
                            walking there in the evening; when above the heads of the mother and
                            sister of Kirchmeier, deputy of the Reichsrath, bayonets and sabres
                            suddenly flashed as they entered the front yard of their own
                            country-seat? Is that a legal state of affairs, when they take from the
                            people clothes, linen, bread—yes, even oranges and the like, and declare
                            them contraband of war; when the police agent is allowed to cuff the
                            ears of an innocent man, because he did not take off his cap to him, and
                            still retain his place; or when it is free for a police officer to open
                            the cells of the prisons, throw the inmates into chains, box their ears,
                            and mishandle them in other ways?</p>
                        <p>Whether the government is responsible for all this the speaker did not
                            know, but the provincial authorities act thus, and as proof he would
                            cite various regulations of the Gallician authorities, from which it
                            might be seen whether in fact the administration of justice was the rule
                            in Gallicia. Immediately after the outbreak of the Polish insurrection
                            the president of the Gallician stadtholderate <pb facs="0149" n="125"
                                xml:id="pg_125"/> issued an order to the effect that the Gallician
                            boundary should be lined with gens d’armes and police guards; but they
                            did not confine themselves to the gens d’armes and police, but called
                            upon the communes for aid. This circumstance roused great anxiety among
                            the country people, who believed that the order was one touching their
                            property and lives, because they could not believe that such a
                            regulation could be adopted for the safety of Russia. However, that was
                            not all, for in an order of April 10, relating to stopping emigration
                            into Poland for the revolution, the agents of the government were
                            ordered to take every possible step to put an effectual stop to this
                            emigration. “To this end,” so says the order, “the local guards are to
                            be strengthened; the local magistrates to be instructed to communicate
                            every piece of information in the quickest possible manner to the
                            authorities, who are, with all circumspection, immediately to seize upon
                            the Polish recruits. With intelligent leaders, where no other aid is to
                            be obtained, the necessary help may be demanded of the country people.”
                            (Hear, hear.) Through this order the men of property among the country
                            people also had their fears excited, and seized their weapons, and the
                            peasant populace seized their arms also, with a suddenness and wrath
                            characteristic of the populace. In the Bochmia circuit eleven communes
                            have thus risen, armed themselves, and rung the alarm bells. They
                            everywhere believe that it is a matter involving their own property and
                            lives, and none can see that it is a question of the safety of Russia. A
                            further order commanded the strengthening of the night-watches in the
                            villages, because in the present extraordinary times those who may be
                            travelling at night must put up with being stopped and called upon for
                            their papers of identification. Thus the passport system has been
                            introduced and put under the charge of the night watchmen. Now, nobody
                            in the land could provide himself with the proper travelling documents,
                            because these instructions remained secret; nor could such documents
                            protect any one, because the agents appointed, belonging to the rudest
                            class of the people, could neither read nor write. (Sensation.) The
                            stadtholderate, which had produced this state of things, then saw itself
                            forced to take some action against it, and so appeared a stadtholder
                            order as to how these acts of force of which the peasant guards had been
                            guilty should be remedied. So long as the more substantial part of the
                            population formed part of the police so organized, there was nothing to
                            complain of; but as this industrious class observed that the only object
                            was the safety of Russia, and therefore returned to their own
                            occupations, none but the roughest portion of the people remained in the
                            guard; and now the pot-house became a sort of tribunal, where the
                            worthiest citizens who had occasion to travel were stopped, brought
                            before this tribunal, and thereupon treated just as it happened to
                            please these roughs. Many were mishandled; many were let off on payment
                            of money. Evil passions threw off restraint to such a degree that women
                            were stopped, and, under pretence that they might be disguised recruits,
                            were actually subjected to bodily examination. Soon after a new
                            regulation was adopted, that of the district patrols. This regulation
                            hitherto in Gallicia was only in force in desert places and against
                            robbers or wild beasts; but this year it is enforced against those
                            people who are only suspected of being recruits, by which again great
                            abuses have been engendered. Soon, too, the stadtholderate found itself
                            compelled to regulate these patrols, and so it was declared in an order
                            in what manner it should be decided whether these patrols should be
                            made; that is, the country to be patrolled must first be spied out, for
                            it says in the order “that trustworthy herdsmen and field watchmen, if
                            they are rewarded when successful, may well be considered as proper
                            persons.” That is, to please Russia the spy system has been offered to
                            the innocent masses as a business. Still, the provincial authorities
                            were not satisfied, and the question came np, how, during these patrols,
                            to bring the houses successively under revision. But it seems that many
                            an agent of government found such harsh regulations offensive, and
                            especially those relating to the protection <pb facs="0150" n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126"/> of personal freedom and house-rights. So, now,
                            this was the question, how to give the officials a dispensation from
                            those laws; hence, to this end, a commentary upon the laws for
                            protection of personal freedom and house-rights was actually promulgated
                            in Gallicia, in which it is said that these two laws offer no impediment
                            to the proposed house revision. It also says such revisions shall only
                            be undertaken in due and proper form. This form, however, according to
                            the commentary, is, that the official who is to undertake such an
                            examination must have beforehand a warrant from the authorities, not,
                            however, directed against any specified house or person, but general,
                            and for all unforeseen cases—a sort of <hi rend="italic">carte
                                blanche.</hi> But all these regulations seemed to the provincial
                            authorities insufficient still, and hence patrolling columns of soldiery
                            were introduced, which seem to have been clothed with extraordinary
                            authority. Such patrols, led by under-officers, stop any traveller,
                            enter houses, make examinations, and carry off any person or thing which
                            to them has a suspicious appearance.</p>
                        <p>The speaker now turned to the remark of the minister of state, that the
                            public feeling in Gallicia was not such as had been pictured by Dr.
                            Diett, and said: In fact, since Austria has held Gallicia in her
                            possession there has never been a period in which the feeling there was
                            so favorable to the government as during the present year. Every ill
                            feeling had disappeared; the most imbittered had laid his hate aside,
                            and not only in Gallicia, but the Poles in all lands, looked with full
                            confidence up to Austria. The government needed not repress inimical
                            demonstrations against itself; we would ourselves be the first to crush
                            them in the bud. What has made the government uneasy is the reports
                            which have come to it from the provincial authorities. The character of
                            these reports may be seen from a single example. At the time of Orsini’s
                            attempt against Emperor Napoleon, a road-builder in Gallicia had
                            obtained a license from the authorities to purchase at an auction powder
                            for the blasting of rocks. Having obtained his license to purchase a
                            hundred pounds of powder, he took it to the proper officials, the same
                            who had had charge of the sale. Now, what did the head of this office
                            do? He wrote to the government that a quantity of powder had been
                            discovered; that a revolution was on the point of breaking out, and that
                            it stood in immediate connexion with the attempt on Emperor Napoleon.
                            Well, committees were sent out and the entire province put in commotion.
                            But nobody found any store of powder, or discovered any revolution; but
                            the official had gained his point. In Vienna it was believed that it was
                            impossible to discover the plot, and yet through this report the central
                            government was convinced that Gallicia stood on a volcano.</p>
                        <p>After adding two other examples, showing how certain persons are
                            determined to convince the government that Gallicia is undermined by
                            revolution, he said, in closing, What to-day are the circumstances of
                            Gallicia? Perhaps the feeling towards the government may have changed,
                            and possibly may not now be as at the beginning I have painted it. That
                            is possible; but judge ye whether the oppression which I have just
                            pictured has been of a character to sustain the good policy for Austria?
                            Nevertheless, we defend ourselves from any charge whatever of there
                            having been any attempts against the Austrian government. These are only
                            to be found in the officious correspondence—they exist only in the
                            reports. We have not the right to demand that you believe us on our own
                            word, but what is a right of ours and a duty of the government is that
                            you listen to us and examine. If the government would “only for once
                            examine into the condition of Gallicia! The commissioners whom the
                            government has sent have applied to just those persons whom we point out
                            as guilty; but that a guilty person should pronounce his own sentence,
                            that has never occurred. Another sort of inquisition must be made. I,
                            for instance, will only remark how I urged upon his excellency, the
                            minister of state—when I proved to him that an intimate correspondence
                            existed between Cracow and the secret <pb facs="0151" n="127"
                                xml:id="pg_127"/> police in Warsaw—to send commissioners to Cracow
                            and convince himself that Russian spies were not merely tolerated in
                            Cracow, but even protected by the officials; how I gave the minister a
                            copy of a document, which stated that the infamous Hermann—he was
                            stabbed at Warsaw—was living in Cracow; that the chief of the
                            stadtholderate had taken him under his protection, and that he made him
                            the subject of a correspondence with the secret police at Warsaw; how I
                            entreated the minister to send a committee to Cracow to examine the
                            papers of this political commissioner, and see whether he was in fact in
                            correspondence with the Russian police. Such examinations, although I
                            pressed them upon the minister, were never undertaken; but when the
                            object is to make <hi rend="italic">us</hi> suspected, and to place the
                            illegalities of Grallicia in another light, <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                            there is no hesitation in making them. I had more to say upon this
                            matter, but, alas! my physical powers fail, and my moral strength is
                            also in such a position far too much enfeebled. (Applause in the house
                            and galleries.)</p>
                        <p>Vice-President <hi rend="smallcaps">V. Hoffner</hi>desired the galleries
                            to refrain from expressions of applause.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">V. Mecsery</hi>, police minister. The gentleman who
                            has just spoken has noted certain facts, and painted them in very lively
                            colors, which, in his opinion, amount to infractions of the laws on the
                            part of certain agents of the government in Gallicia. As to facts, there
                            is no other mode of treating them than to examine and prove them.
                            Precisely these facts are doubtless recorded in the memorial to the
                            minister of state, and their examination will first place the government
                            in a position to judge of their importance. As to the general picture
                            which the speaker has drawn, and which represents Grallicia as a land in
                            which pure arbitrary will rules—to this general picture I allow myself
                            to oppose an equally general one of the actual condition of things, and
                            my assertions are based upon documents which have been obtained in the
                            several cases of arrest, and are now in the hands of the authorities.
                            When a secret government exists in a country, and extends its branches
                            over all the land, [hear, hear,] and reaches with its organs even into
                            the communes; when this government, in every sense, assumes to act like
                            the legitimate one; when it imposes taxes; when it sends out the printed
                            forms of these taxes; when, in particular cases, it proceeds to threats
                            of punishment; when in Cracow a military headquarters exists, a command
                            which, together with its entire and very extensive registry, has been
                            but lately abolished; when this command divides the city into districts,
                            each of which had its supervisor; when the dwellings were conscribed;
                            when the quartering of troops and the furnishing of draught-horses were
                            ordered; when reports made to these headquarters are in our possession
                            in which the national <hi rend="italic">gens d’armes</hi> report upon
                            persons whom they hold for suspicious, of course suspicious in the sense
                            of the national government; when communications from military leaders of
                            the insurgents to these headquarters are in our possession which demand
                            that this or that person, for this or that offence, shall be brought
                            before the Cracow court-martial—when such a condition of things obtains,
                            I am of opinion it is an absolute duty of the government to meet it with
                            all the means which the laws afford; and that those laws have been
                            transgressed is a point to be first proved in each particular case. The
                            bare narrative of the honorable deputy—notwithstanding I place all
                            confidence in his words— is not sufficient to enable me, at least, to
                            form a well-grounded judgment. If we now survey the condition of
                            Gallicia, as it has for some time appeared to any unprejudiced person,
                            there appears, at the first glance, an immense concourse of strangers—a
                            multitudinous congregation of suspicious foreigners without passports,
                            and from all quarters. On the other hand there are the strangers’ police
                            and the registry regulations, which are the, means given the authorities
                            of meeting such an evil; and an evil it certainly is; but these legal
                            regulations are certainly not made merely for the normal condition of
                            things, just to enable us to read in the papers that this or that person
                            has come to town; these <pb facs="0152" n="128" xml:id="pg_128"/>
                            registry rules are laid down precisely for those moments in which it is
                            of the highest moment for the public authorities to come to a knowledge
                            of these strangers, who exert no unimportant influence upon the peace of
                            the country. When, moreover, experience has shown that of ten such
                            persons arrested eight at least are most certainly provided with false
                            legitimation papers, I am of opinion the provisions are completely
                            justified which have been made by the authorities, who sternly put in
                            execution this branch of the administration of the laws. It has been
                            stated that houses have often been, searched, and that these
                            examinations have been made in the night; yet, what shall be done under
                            such circumstances, when it is clear that by day the individuals sought
                            are not to be found? The process must take place in the night if the
                            desired end is to be reached. I have thus, in general, and in few words,
                            hinted that the condition of Gallicia is by no means as rosy as it has
                            been depicted by the honorable deputy. When, however, he says that the
                            reports of the provincial authorities are as darkly colored only for the
                            sake of frightening the central government, I can most emphatically
                            utter the assurance that the government has no fears. It will not be
                            scared from its duty to sustain, under all circumstances, the authority
                            of the legitimate government, and to protect the peaceful portion of the
                            population against the oppression which, should it long be continued,
                            will plunge the land into ruin. (Bravo, from the centre and left.)</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Zyblikiewiez</hi>, deputy. I fear to trouble the
                            house longer with this debate. I might, however, answer the minister of
                            police instantly with my own paper, that which I have sent to the
                            ministry of police. I shall find an opportunity to discuss the matter
                            further.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>There are symptoms that the German-Danish
                            question in the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, now pressing for its
                            solution, after vain attempts for so many years to bury it, may lead to
                            a European war.</p>
                        <p>The condition of affairs was critical before the death of King Frederick
                            VII, which occurred on the 15th of this month.</p>
                        <p>Denmark has a total population of about 2,700,000; of which the duchies
                            of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg are, in round numbers, a million,
                            or considerably more than one-third of the whole.</p>
                        <p>Holstein is, actually and undoubtedly, German in population and in
                            feeling; and King Frederick, in his capacity of Duke of Holstein, was a
                            member of the German confederation.</p>
                        <p>Schleswig is neither historically nor politically a constituent part of
                            what is commonly called Germany, and is not represented at the Frankfort
                            Diet, but it has a considerable German population, among whom the recent
                            efforts on the part of the government to consolidate its power, and give
                            preponderance to the Danish element in schools, churches, and the public
                            service, has produced much dissatisfaction, and called forth loud
                            complaints of tyranny and ill usage. Born German Schleswegers here, to
                            my knowledge, complained that they were treated more cruelly than the
                            Poles in Russia, or than the slaves in the southern States of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>This is doubtless a figure of speech, but it illustrates the exasperation
                            of feeling which exists. These outcries have awakened a universal
                            sympathy throughout Germany, where, to judge from the language of the
                            press and of conversation, there is no difference of opinion on this
                            matter, every man, from prince to peasant, feeling with equal keenness
                            in regard to it.</p>
                        <pb facs="0153" n="129" xml:id="pg_129"/>
                        <p>On the other band, the government, feeling that its national existence
                            was at stake—for without the duchies Denmark could hardly rank as an
                            independent kingdom—and that the gravitation of this portion of its
                            domain towards Germany should be checked at all hazards, proceeded with
                            stringent measures in regard both to Schleswig and to Holstein, which
                            called forth remonstrances from the German Diet, and led to a sharp
                            correspondence between that body and the Danish government. The events,
                            as they have developed themselves during the past year, have doubtless
                            attracted your attention; so that, without going into details, or
                            expressing any opinion as to the merits of the question, I need only
                            remind you that, at last, the Frankfort Diet formally notified the
                            Danish government that unless its decree of 30th March last should be
                            revoked, which the Diet had declared to be a violation of the laws of
                            the German confederation and of treaty stipulations, troops would be
                            sent from Germany to occupy the duchy of Holstein, in order to execute
                            this declaration of the Diet, and keep possession until the desired
                            revocation. The Danish government replied that the decree itself was
                            provisional, but it proceeded to mature a constitution for
                            Denmark-Schleswig, incorporating that duchy with the kingdom, and to
                            maintain in form certain objectionable regulations in Holstein.</p>
                        <p>This constitution, being ultra-Danish in its character, was considered as
                            embodying and perpetuating the principles of the 30th March decree, and
                            as violating engagements formally entered into by Denmark, and the Diet
                            resolved to proceed with the execution if the new constitution should be
                            signed by the king.</p>
                        <p>That constitution was drawn up and ready to be signed on the 13th of the
                            present month, but the king, who had for some time been ailing, was
                            unable to attend to business. On the 15th the world was startled by the
                            news of his death.</p>
                        <p>The sensation was as great as that which a week before had been caused by
                            the speech from the French throne. At first, however, it was hoped by
                            many that the accession of the new king would produce a favorable
                            change. It would obviously be not only courteous but necessary to pause
                            in the execution until Christian IX should develop his policy. He might
                            refuse to sign the constitution, which his predecessor had been
                            prevented by death from signing. He might remove his ministers, dissolve
                            his parliament, and exchange ultra-Danish proceedings for more German
                            measures. But should he incline to do this, it was at once evident that
                            he would forfeit his crown before he had time to put it on his head.
                            After a very brief interval of reflection, he yielded to the pressure of
                            the Danes, signed the constitution, and retained his ministers.</p>
                        <p>There is no reason, therefore, why the execution should not be proceeded
                            with at once. And the news to-day is that the Saxon and Hanoverian
                            contingents are about to march towards Holstein, while the popular
                            excitement throughout Germany is very great. It is said and hoped that
                            this measure will not be accepted by the Danish government as an act of
                            war; but I have it on excellent authority that it will recall its
                            legations from the German courts as soon as the execution shall take
                            place. Whether this be true or not, time will soon show. It will be
                            seen, too, whether England and France will take part with Denmark in
                            resisting by force of arms the execution, or whether they will counsel
                            and compel her to avoid war by prudent concessions. Denmark takes the
                            ground that she has conceded and parleyed and argued enough, and that if
                            her existence be, as the great powers have avowed, a political
                            necessity, it is time that they help her to maintain that existence by
                            something stronger than words.</p>
                        <p>The governments of Prussia and Austria are the more ready now to go on
                            with the execution, because the death of the last sovereign, whose claim
                            was undisputed, has opened a new question, which, it was hoped, had been
                            settled by the protocol of 1852; for it must not be forgotten that the
                            execution question <pb facs="0154" n="130" xml:id="pg_130"/> is an
                            entirely distinct one from the question of succession, although both
                            threaten a European war. I have no desire to examine the merits of the
                            succession question, and I shall only very briefly recall to your
                            remembrance one or two leading facts.</p>
                        <p>The protocol of 1852, by which the Duke of Schleswig-Glucksburg was
                            declared the successor of the childless King Frederick VII, who has just
                            died, was signed not only by England, France, and Russia, but by Austria
                            and Prussia. The protocol was distinctly stated to have for its object
                            the maintenance of the integrity of the Danish monarchy, as a European
                            necessity. It did not affect to untie the legal knot of succession to
                            the duchies of Schleswig, Lauenburg, and Holstein, which centuries of
                            intermarriages had made nearly insoluble, but it cut it in pieces. A
                            large number of claimants to the heritage of these provinces were at
                            once set aside, so far as the protocol could do it; and the most
                            prominent of them, the Duke of Schleswig-Augustenburg, renounced his
                            pretensions in his own name and in that of his descendants. He also
                            received three millions of thalers, but whether as compensation for his
                            claims or for his private estates in the duchies is, I believe, like
                            everything else, a matter of dispute.</p>
                        <p>The protocol, however, although signed by Austria and Prussia as European
                            powers, was never sanctioned by the estates of the provinces in
                            question, nor by the German Bund. Bavaria, indeed, and one or two other
                            small powers, protested against it at the time; and it has always been
                            anticipated that the death of Frederick VII would bring about the
                            commotions in Germany which are now taking place.</p>
                        <p>Yet it has been rather the fashion in Europe to sneer at the
                            Schleswig-Holstein question, as the embodiment of all that was tedious
                            and incomprehensible, and to shove it aside for what were considered
                            graver matters. It now rises again with a more menacing aspect than ever
                            out of the grave of the late king, and will not be so easily exorcised.
                            It may now cost thousands of lives before it will consent to vanish.</p>
                        <p>The Prince of Schleswig, Augustenburg, son of the duke who renounced his
                            family rights, has formally assumed the title of Duke of
                            Schleswig-Holstein, announced his accession to the estates, and summoned
                            the Bund to recognize his plenipotentiary at the Diet as the rightful
                            representative of Holstein and Lauenburg. Several of the lesser German
                            sovereignties, as Baden, Coburg, Altenburg, and others, have expressed
                            their intention of supporting him; and the question has already been put
                            in the hands of a committee at a meeting of the Diet.</p>
                        <p>His supporters speak fluently of his legal claim to the duchies as
                            unuqestionable. I should say that all that was unquestionable was, that,
                            if German law prevails in the duchies, the female branch, and those
                            claiming through females, cannot succeed; and that, therefore, the right
                            of Christian IX, and with it the integrity of the Danish monarchy, rests
                            entirely upon the protocol, and upon the vigor with which it is defended
                            by the sword of Denmark and her allies. But to say, on the other hand,
                            that the claims of the Augustenburgs are unquestionable, is to speak
                            specifically. There are many claimants not only to each of the three
                            duchies, but to separate portions of each duchy, the most formidable
                            among which heirs-at-law to a part at least of the property is the Czar
                            of Russia as chief of the house of Holstein-Gottorp.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it is maintained that in Schleswig it was arranged centuries
                            ago by formal instruments, with every legal sanction, that the
                            succession to that duchy should follow the succession to the Danish
                            crown. In short, any one who has ever studied law or history must
                            recognize at a glance that this is exactly one of those questions which
                            might occupy all the jurisconsults and genealogists of Europe for the
                            rest of this century, before it could be settled beyond possibility of
                            cavil, and which, if it regarded a private estate, would be sure to be
                            kept in <pb facs="0155" n="131" xml:id="pg_131"/> chancery until the
                            whole property was consumed, and two or three generations of claimants
                            had died of starvation.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, not the faintest intention of examining the merits of
                            the case; and it would certainly be a marvellous spectacle if all
                            Europe, in this age of the world, were to be plunged into a sanguinary
                            and protracted struggle to settle such a lawsuit.</p>
                        <p>One would have thought that the time had gone by for wars of succession;
                            but they must, perhaps, periodically recur, as results of the European
                            principle, that great countries, with all their inhabitants, are the
                            private property of a small number of privileged families.</p>
                        <p>The probable attitude of the great powers on this question is far more
                            important than the legal aspects of the case. Austria and Prussia signed
                            the protocol, but it is contended that they did not sign it as members
                            of the Bund, but only as European powers. Moreover, Austria and Prussia
                            might easily be outvoted in a plenary sitting of the Diet. Practically,
                            however, it is absurd to suppose that the Bund could take active war
                            measures, or active measures of any kind, without the consent of these
                            two great constituents. The Germanic Confederation, even with Austria
                            and Prussia, is but a political shadow. Without them it is not even the
                            shadow of a shade.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the Austrian government is most anxious to recognize
                            Christian IX as Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg, and to
                            maintain the Danish monarchy in its entirety. It also desires to act in
                            concurrence with Prussia on this question. Up to the moment of this
                            writing, however, Prussia has not yet answered a proposition of Austria
                            to this effect, and has not yet shown its hand.</p>
                        <p>Meantime, to judge by the almost universal language of the German press,
                            and by excited speeches made by prominent members of the liberal party
                            to the National German Union League, and to enthusiastic mass meetings,
                            embracing six to ten thousand, (according to reports,) in Hamburg,
                            Hanover, Frankfort, and other places, the German feeling is rising to
                            fever heat. It is loudly proclaimed that the hour has at last struck for
                            delivering a million of German brethren from Danish oppression, and for
                            reannexing to the fatherland these duchies, which are once for all to be
                            now separated forever from Denmark.</p>
                        <p>The chronic rivalry between Austria and Prussia for the leadership of
                            Germany makes it difficult and dangerous for either power to balk this
                            German enthusiasm in its first effervescence, and to confront this
                            strong manifestation in favor of the Augustenburg as the legal
                            proprietor and master of the duchies and all their inhabitants—who thus,
                            by an odd combination of circumstances, appears at once as the
                            standard-bearer of the most antiquated legitimacy, and the
                            representative of the great principle of German nationality and popular
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>The moment is an anxious one. How can the Band make, or even contemplate,
                            war with Denmark, backed up certainly by England, and probably by France
                            and Russia? Yet how can all this Germanism be got to bubble quietly
                            away, and subside without any blood-letting?</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, how, in case of the Bund’s proceeding to actual
                            hostilities, can England tolerate the immense damage to her commerce
                            which would be caused by the blockading by Denmark of Hamburg, Bremen,
                            and other German ports in the North sea? It is useless to deny the
                            existence of a very widespread desire among the inhabitants of Germany
                            to sever the duchies from Denmark; and this desire is encouraged and
                            shared in by many of the less important sovereigns of the country.
                            Should this desire ripen into determination, it is possible that the
                            people may compel the leading German powers to place themselves at the
                            head of the movement. In this case Denmark must fight for the protocol,
                            and be supported in so doing by other powers, or it must cease to exist.
                            The Austrian government is anxious to stand by the protocol, and
                            recognize <pb facs="0156" n="132" xml:id="pg_132"/> Christian IX as
                            sovereign over all the realms of his predecessor, but Prussia still
                            hesitates.</p>
                        <p>Meantime the supreme tribunal of Holstein has refused the oath of
                            allegiance to the new king, an expression of a legal opinion the gravity
                            of which cannot be gainsaid.</p>
                        <p>I shall say no more to-day, except that Europe is likely to have enough
                            on its hands at home during the coming year, and that certain of the
                            great powers are likely to check that periodical and mischievous desire
                            for intermeddling in our affairs which is so apt to break out when the
                            cisatlantic world is comparatively tranquil.</p>
                        <p>We have it on the high authority of the Emperor Napoleon that the
                            political fabric of Europe is dilapidated—that its foundations are
                            crumbling in all directions. Since those words were spoken a great war
                            threatens to desolate Europe in order to settle the comparative value of
                            a protocol, signed a dozen years ago, by the representatives of half a
                            dozen kings, and a series of musty parchments centuries old. A lawsuit
                            about a meagre province of puny proportions in the North sea is about to
                            set Europe in flames, while already a congress has been called to avert
                            a war in another direction, and nobody believes in its efficacy. In the
                            last dozen years there have already been two great European wars,
                            besides lesser and more distant ones, which are chronic, carried on by
                            the leading powers. Not a great power of them all but holds in
                            subjection by force of arms millions of mankind, alien to their
                            language, their race, or their religion. One great monarchy bombards and
                            burns populous cities at one end of the earth, every inhabitant of which
                            is innocent of any thought of offence against the bombarding nation;
                            another great monarchy carries fire and sword into a republic at the
                            other end of the world, and seeks to subjugate it by force of arms and
                            convert it into an empire; meantime the whole surface of Europe conceals
                            smouldering revolutionary fires, which are likely to find vent at any
                            moment and in any direction; while the fear of such outbreaks, combined
                            with the perpetual rivalries and international hatreds of hostile
                            dynasties and nations, necessitates enormous armaments by land and sea,
                            even in times of peace, which cripple the energies, exhaust the
                            resources, and sicken the hearts of the people. A contemplation of
                            European politics leads us to the sincere prayer that America may never
                            be Europeanized.</p>
                        <p>I may be oversanguine, but a doubt has not yet crossed my mind that the
                            American republic, based upon constitutional law, popular
                            self-government, and the great principles of reason and justice, will
                            suppress an insurrection made for the perpetuation and extension of
                            African slavery, and for the abrogation of the first principles of
                            freedom. I expect as much to see the sun set at noonday as to witness
                            the destruction of our noble commonwealth and its dismemberment into a
                            jarring, warring Europe, without the historical excuses of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The American people will carry on its righteous war of self-defence so
                            long as a single rebel remains in arms to threaten the national
                            existence, or to extend and perpetuate the accursed institution out of
                            which all our misery has flowed. When that blessed result, which cannot
                            now be far off, is reached, America may justly hope for centuries of
                            peace, prosperity, and power; while if we fail our future is endless
                            war. Meantime Europe, occupied with its own dynastic wars, in which the
                            people have no part, will have less time just now to read us moral
                            lectures on the blessings of peace.</p>

                            affairs in Europe becomes every day more threatening.</p>
                        <p>There is but little said now of the Polish insurrection, which is
                            considered as having been virtually suppressed by the superior force of
                            the Russian government. The result of the many months of diplomatic
                            correspondence on the part of the three great powers with Russia has
                            been to excite hopes which were never to be fulfilled and enmities not
                            easy to allay.</p>
                        <p>Any other issue could hardly have been anticipated when one of the three
                            intervening powers had distinctly stated that she would never draw the
                            sword in the dispute, and when it was quite obvious that such
                            declarations on the part of one of the others would have been quite
                            superfluous.</p>
                        <p>I beg to call your particular attention to the debate in the Austrian
                            Reichsrath, a translation of which is appended to my despatch No. 39,
                            from which you will see that for the imperial government of Austria to
                            take part in a war against Russia in the cause of Poland has always been
                            an impossibility. The result of intervention by words and letters has
                            been, therefore, the reverse of beneficial. In the words of the Emperor
                            Napoleon, “the steps of England, of Austria, and of Prance, in place of
                            arresting the struggle, have only envenomed it.” (Speech of November 5.)
                            The refusal of the English government to accept the proposition of a
                            European congress would seem to make the fulfilment of that project
                            hopeless; indeed, it would seem, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to
                            have been hopeless. The sovereigns of Europe were invited to consult
                            together in person upon the great questions which agitate Europe. It was
                            understood that, among others, the Italian question, the German-Danish
                            question, the Polish question, and the Danubian principality question,
                            were to be discussed. But is it possible to imagine the King of Italy,
                            the Emperor of Austria, and the Pope amicably discussing the Italian
                            question? Can any one dream that King Victor Emanuel would agree to
                            restore the provinces which he has acquired at the expense of the Papal
                            see and of Austria, or that he would solemnly renounce in the face of
                            the world the cherished hopes of the Italian people to obtain possession
                            of Rome and of Venetia? Can any one imagine, on the other hand, that the
                            Pope would recognize the possession by that potentate of those portions
                            already acquired by him of the patrimony of St. Peter, or would in
                            advance surrender Rome; or that the Emperor of Austria would entertain a
                            proposition to abandon Venice, or the Italian Tyrol? Or could anything
                            more unlikely be suggested than that the German Bund would submit what
                            it considers a purely German question to the arbitration of foreign
                            powers?</p>
                        <p>If such questions can be settled amicably by sovereigns or their
                            plenipotentiaries around a green table, the millennium is much nearer
                            than one would, from any other symptom, suppose it to be. I fear,
                            therefore, that the general consultation to devise a panacea for those
                            fatal diseases which, according to the alarming description of the
                            French Emperor, now afflict the body politic of Europe, is not likely to
                            be held. It is now understood that this empire has not declined the
                            congress “in principle,” but wishes a preliminary programme, and similar
                            evasive acceptances by the other leading powers would seem equivalent to
                            a refusal.</p>
                        <p>Thus this hemisphere is to remain in the desperate condition in which it
                            found itself, according to such high authority, on the 5th of
                            November—“Europe is laboring on all sides with the elements of
                            dissolution. * * * * The edifice is undermined by time, and destroyed
                            piecemeal by revolution. * * <pb facs="0158" n="134" xml:id="pg_134"/> *
                            * The state of things is deranged and ruinious, * * * and crumbling
                            away.” (Speech of November 5 of French Emperor.)</p>
                        <p>The pregnant questions addressed to the rulers of this part of the world
                            by the same sovereign—“Shall the jealous rivalry of the great powers
                            forever hinder the progress of civilization? Shall we always keep up
                            mutual distrust by excessive armaments? Are we to exhaust the most
                            precious resources indefinitely in a vain ostentation of our forces? Are
                            we to preserve forever a state of things which is neither peace with its
                            security, nor war with its chances of success?”—are not likely to
                            receive satisfactory answers. It is for the powers who do not accept the
                            congress to reply to the taunt that their “refusal leaves room to
                            suspect the existence of secret projects that will not bear the light of
                            day.”</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it may be thought that it will require all the
                            wisdom of European rulers to regulate their own affairs, thus officially
                            declared to be hopelessly tending to ruin, and that we may be saved
                            during the coming year from any interference on their part in our
                            business.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped to send you by this post something definite in regard to the
                            attitude of the Austrian government in the Schleswig-Holstein matter. A
                            statement is daily expected in the Reichsrath from the minister of
                            foreign affairs, but it has not yet been made.</p>
                        <p>On the constitutional question it may be said that no difference of
                            opinion exists in Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Bund will unanimously carry out by force its decision that the new
                            Danish constitution is unlawful. The decree of execution and occupation
                            of Holstein has, however, not yet been made by the Diet, because
                            precedence has been in a certain sense given to the succession
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Diet has just voted not to receive the Danish minister as
                            representative of Holstein. Thus the question as to the rightful
                            successor to the duchies is declared to be in suspense.</p>
                        <p>There are unofficial indications also of a willingness on the part of
                            Austria and Prussia to conform to a majority of the Diet, when it comes
                            to a vote on the succession question. In that case the whole force of
                            the Bund would proceed to occupy Holstein, not only in order to protect
                            that duchy against the imposition of the constitution, pronounced
                            unlawful by the Bund, but in order to hold the territory until it shall
                            be decided who is its rightful sovereign. The excitement in Germany on
                            the subject is widespread and increasing. On the other hand, it is
                            difficult to see how Denmark can help resisting this invasion by
                            defending her fortresses and by aggressive maritime measures. This would
                            be war, and it will then be for England to decide whether the
                            maintenance of the integrity of the Danish monarchy is a sufficient
                            cause for her to engage in hostilities with the Bund.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I transmit in this despatch a translation
                            of Count Rechberg’s statement in the Reichsrath, on the 4th of this
                            month, in regard to the Schleswig-Holstein matter. You will perceive
                            that the imperial government takes the <pb facs="0159" n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135"/> ground that it is bound by the London protocol of
                            1852, which it signed as a European power. In this course it is acting
                            in harmony with the Prussian government, whose position has already been
                            announced.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian government maintains, however, that the stipulations entered
                            into by Denmark in regard to the government of the duchies, which
                            preceded and formed the base of the London treaty, are with the protocol
                            itself parts of an indivisible whole. As these stipulations have been
                            violated on the part of Denmark, by the 30th March decree, and by the
                            new constitution in which the provisions of that decree have been
                            subsequently embodied, the Austrian government, in common with Prussia,
                            has decided to urge upon the Bund the necessity of sending a force into
                            Holstein to execute the laws of the Bund; to fulfil, in short, the
                            execution voted by the Diet before the death of Frederick VII.</p>
                        <p>In this position, as you are doubtless aware, Prussia and Austria are far
                            behind the desires of the rest of the German states. They are also
                            behind the aspirations of the great majority of the public of Prussia
                            and Austria, so far as those sentiments can be ascertained by the tone
                            of the press and of popular assemblies.</p>
                        <p>The Prussian Chamber of Deputies has just adopted resolutions, by a
                            majority of 231 to 63, that the Duke of Augustenburg has an
                            unquestionable claim to the government of the duchies; that not the
                            German Bund, nor the estates of Schleswig-Holstein, nor the male heirs
                            of the house of Oldenburg, have ever acceded to the decision of the
                            London treaty of 1852, that no ruler can be imposed by foreign powers
                            upon a German race against its own will and against constitutional laws;
                            that Denmark, by violation of its own engagements, and by oppression of
                            the German population in Schleswig, has forfeited all claim to the
                            protection of the London treaty, and released the German powers from all
                            obligations to sustain it; and that, therefore, the continued presence
                            of the Danish troops in Holstein is a foreign invasion of German
                            territory; that the honor and interest of Germany require that all
                            German states should protect the rights of the duchies, recognize the
                            Duke of Augustenburg as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, and give him
                            requisite assistance in enforcing these rights. These resolutions
                            embody, I should think, the sentiments of a large majority of the
                            population of Germany as at present manifested, and the governments of
                            nearly all the other states of the Bund would be ready to urge upon the
                            Diet immediate action upon this basis.</p>
                        <p>In short, the Austrian and Prussian governments have declared simply for
                            execution, or an enforcement by Bund troops of the violated laws of the
                            Bund and of treaty stipulations; while the rest of Germany, including a
                            majority of Austrian and Prussian subjects, are believed to be in favor
                            of the occupation and sequestration of the duchies, until the competent
                            Bund tribunal shall decide the question of succession.</p>
                        <p>Execution is recognition of Christian IX as legal sovereign of the
                            duchies, whether the point be technically reserved or not, say the
                            opponents of this policy. Sequestration, with possible dismemberment of
                            the Danish monarchy, is breach of faith, say the Austrian and Prussian
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>The German Bund is bound by no faith nor treaty to sustain the integrity
                            of Denmark, is the reply; and foreign powers have no right to exercise
                            authority over German territory.</p>
                        <p>Austria and Prussia as European powers signed the treaty of 1852; but as
                            members of the Bund they are bound to submit to the decisions of the
                            majority of the Bund. That majority may possibly decide in favor of
                            sequestration.</p>
                        <p>The debate which followed upon Count Rechberg’s exposition of his policy
                            lasted four hours, and was a far more excited one than ever before
                            occurred in the Reichsrath. The minister was obliged to contend
                            single-handed against the assaults of many of the ablest members of the
                            house; and the position of government <pb facs="0160" n="136"
                                xml:id="pg_136"/> was vehemently assailed, not only by its ancient
                            foes, but by others who were formerly its staunch supporters.</p>
                        <p>I send journals containing reports of the debate, in case you may desire
                            to examine it. It would have been impossible for me to send a
                            translation in time, and, moreover, the packet would have been too
                            bulky. The tone and general bearing of the argument you may gather from
                            my despatches; but I regret not being able to give you the text of the
                            speeches, which were often excellent specimens of forensic eloquence.
                            Had a vote been taken, which in the manner in which the case came up was
                            not possible, it is supposed that at least as large a majority would
                            have been obtained as in the Prussian chamber in favor of sequestration,
                            and consequently against the measures of the government. All the
                            speakers were in opposition, and each was disposed to outvie the other
                            in giving expression to the most intense Germanism.</p>
                        <p>What is most interesting to a spectator, and especially to an American,
                            in the whole affair, is its bearing on the question of Germanic union.
                            The great mass of the German people, and all its rulers except the
                            Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia, are disposed to make use of
                            this occasion to wrest forever from the jurisdiction of a foreign
                            sovereign these integral portions of German territory, and to denounce
                            by something stronger than words the pretension of the great European
                            powers to exercise authority or enact statutes in regard to German soil.
                            It is the Pentarchy against United Germany; and it is now for the
                            Austrian and Prussian governments to decide whether their position as
                            members of the Pentarchy or of the German Bund is most valuable to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>As to the Prussian government, its choice has not been doubtful. It
                            hardly affects much veneration for the Bund, and treats with hardly
                            disguised scorn the idea that the petty princes of Germany or a majority
                            of its people should outweigh in the Diet the decisions of a great
                            European monarchy.</p>
                        <p>But the Austrian government, which so lately was obtaining great
                            popularity by its striking attempt to draw closer the bonds which unite
                            the sovereigns and the peoples of Germany, is likely to cause a general
                            and bitter disappointment, should its course, on what the national party
                            considers a crucial matter, seem as anti-German as that of the Prussian
                            monarchy.</p>
                        <p>As to the practical issue, it is not possible to predict it until the
                            vote of the Diet shall be taken, which, however, cannot be delayed much
                            longer. Austria and Prussia will naturally do their utmost to obtain a
                            vote for execution, and not for sequestration. Should the Diet by a
                            majority insist on sequestration, there are no indications that Austria
                            and Prussia will submit to that majority. Should they refuse, is it not
                            a proof that the Bund is a sham, that it is without vitality, and that
                            it is quite time to bury it decently? Will it not be an additional
                            proof, if any were wanting by Americans, that the theory of State
                            rights, of independent sovereignties forming part of a common whole, is
                            an impossible one? The wisdom of our fathers changed our Confederacy
                            into a Union. Our States are fortunately not sovereign, and have no
                            claim to be recognized as such in the general family of nations. That
                            useful position is reserved to the United Republic alone. But here is a
                            great kingdom and a mighty empire signing, as world powers, a treaty
                            which, as members of a confederacy, they may be called upon to
                            repudiate. Naturally they feel bound in honor to maintain their plighted
                            faith. Yet if the confederacy cannot compel its members to obey its
                            decrees, it proclaims its impotence to the world. Will the great object
                            at which the imperial government is aiming, to avert war on the
                            Schleswig-Holstein question, be attained?</p>
                        <p>The impression seems to be as general just now that war may be avoided,
                            as it was a few days ago, that war was inevitable. Yet I do not see what
                            has happened to make a pacific result very probable.</p>
                        <p>If execution takes place, precisely the same state of things will exist
                            which, <pb facs="0161" n="137" xml:id="pg_137"/> before the death of the
                            late king, seemed about to bring on a war. But in face of the graver
                            question which the popular excitement in Germany has now raised—before
                            the new king has been recognized by the Bund—it is believed that the
                            course of Austria and Prussia is really protective and conciliatory to
                            Denmark. Not only these powers but the others who signed the protocol
                            are supposed to be putting great pressure upon the Danish government in
                            order to induce it to submit peaceably to the execution, and to make the
                            necessary concessions. But although politicians are often illogical,
                            events are never so; and it is difficult to understand how the king can
                            withdraw a constitution which he has just signed and promulgated, and
                            which he signed under the pressure of an impending revolt in his own
                            capital. Will not the Danish excitement be increased rather than awed by
                            the presence of German troops in Holstein, and by the passionate
                            denunciations of Denmark with which all Germany is ringing? Will not the
                            king, obliged to choose between an insurrection in his kingdom and a war
                            with all Germany, draw the sword, however outmatched he may be at the
                            outset? And if blows are once struck, will not the same European
                            necessity for the integrity of Denmark, which was the basis of the
                            protocol of 1852, compel England, notwithstanding her pacific counsels
                            to Denmark, to come to the rescue of that monarchy at last, which
                            otherwise would not only be dismembered but annihilated? I confess that
                            the way does not seem to me very clear to a pacific adjustment, even
                            although hostilities may for a time be deferred.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—Since the above was written, the telegraph brings information
                                that the 30th March decree has been proclaimed by the King of
                                Denmark to be no longer in force, and there is even a report that a
                                proposal to suspend the constitution until January 1, 1865, will be
                                made to the Chambers. On the other hand, we are informed from
                                Frankfort that the Diet, by a small majority, has voted for
                                execution under reserve of the succession question, and that the
                                order to march has been given to the Bund troops.</p>
                            <p>Whether the first-named concession on the part of Denmark is enough
                                to avert war; whether the reported design as to the second be really
                                entertained; and whether the diplomatic victory obtained by Austria
                                and Prussia at Frank-fort will calm or increase the agitation in
                                Germany, time will soon show. The crisis must occur ere long.</p>

                        <p>In the session of the Chamber of Deputies to-day his excellency Count
                            Rechberg, minister for foreign affairs, answered the interpellation of
                            deputy Dr. Rechbauer and his colleagues as follows:</p>
                        <p>Count <hi rend="smallcaps">Rechberg.</hi> It is known to the high
                            assembly that the execution of the Bund in Holstein was already on the
                            point of taking place, when, by the death of King Frederick VII, the
                            German-Danish dispute assumed the proportions of a serious European
                            complication. A succession question, touching the territorial condition
                            of Europe, arose unexpectedly at the same moment, in which the German
                            Bund was about, by a military occupation of Holstein and <pb facs="0162"
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138"/> Lauenburg, to obtain for itself the
                            exercise of those rights which for ten years have been persistently
                            infringed by the royal Danish government. The two great German powers
                            stand in exactly the same position with regard to this complication, and
                            the imperial government holds that, before all things, it is desirable
                            and important, as a member of the Bund, and as an independent power, not
                            to act without the fullest understanding with Prussia. To my
                            satisfaction I can announce that the views of the royal Prussian
                            government agree with our own, and I can assert that it is the joint
                            resolution of Austria and Prussia to hold to the following points: The
                            treaty which was concluded in London, on the 8th of May, 1852, between
                            Austria, France,. Great Britain, Prussia, Russia and Sweden, on the one
                            side, and Denmark on the other, and which was ratified by his Majesty
                            the Emperor on the 24th of the same month, and which was later joined by
                            many other governments, including several German ones, by formal acts of
                            accession, founded for all those who took part in its positive
                            obligations under international law. Austria and Prussia cannot,
                            therefore, at once, and certainly not in their quality of European
                            powers, be freed from these obligations by the mere fact that the German
                            Bund was not asked to adhere to the London treaty.</p>
                        <p>In their voting in Frankfort they cannot put themselves in opposition to
                            those obligations towards Denmark into which they entered in accord with
                            nearly the whole of Europe. The real state of the treaty obligations
                            between the German powers and Denmark was, however, not to be looked for
                            in the London treaty alone. A long series of negotiations as to the
                            constitutional position of the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein and
                            Lauenburg in the United Danish monarchy had preceded the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Austria had declared most positively in these negotiations, that it was
                            not disposed to interest itself in a European sanction of the principle
                            of the integrity of the Danish monarchy, and in the establishment of
                            this principle by means of a settled succession, until the German powers
                            had obtained the assurances which they considered just and right for the
                            maintenance of the rights of Germany and of the duchies, and for the
                            protection of German nationality. It was not until Denmark had decided,
                            in December, 1851, to bind itself to fulfil these demands, that Austria
                            and Prussia offered their hands to join those negotiations in London
                            which resulted in the treaty of the 8th of May, 1852. It is true that
                            the Article III of this treaty contains only a general provision that
                            the mutual rights and obligations in regard to the duchies of Holstein
                            and Lauenburg, proceeding from the action of the Bund in 1815 and from
                            the existing rights of the Bund, should not be altered by this treaty.
                            There is no mention here of the stipulations of 1851. They are not taken
                            up as a particular condition in the London treaty, which bears the
                            signatures of so many other powers who have no share in the question of
                            the constitution of the Danish monarchy, but, notwithstanding, they
                            contain demonstrably the assumption upon which the German powers agreed
                            to the London treaty. In the relations between Germany and Denmark they,
                            therefore, form a whole with that treaty, and the imperial government is
                            therefore of opinion that if Denmark appeals to the London treaty in
                            regard to Prussia and Austria, Prussia and Austria will be justified in
                            answering that Denmark must fulfil the stipulation upon which the treaty
                            obligations now called in question undoubtedly rest. This case is before
                            us at the present moment. Already, during the reign of the predecessor
                            of King Christian IX, the courts of Copenhagen had, as I have already
                            said, exhausted the patience of Germany; and unfortunately the new
                            sovereign, in spite of the most earnest remonstrances, and in spite of
                            many warning voices, which were not even wanting in the Danish
                            Reichsrath, has signalized the beginning of his reign by a formal breach
                            of the agreements of 1851. Under these circumstances, Austria and
                            Prussia have declared at Frankfort for the suspension of the Holstein
                            vote, and they are of opinion that in the face of such open provocation
                                <pb facs="0163" n="139" xml:id="pg_139"/> the Bund owes it to itself
                            to proceed, without any further delay, to carry out the execution which
                            has already been decided on. Nor does the pretext that this measure
                            contains within itself a recognition of the legitimacy of the government
                            of King Christian IX in Holstein and Lauenburg seem to them by any means
                            tenable, as an especial reserve of the right to try the question of
                            succession can be connected with a resolution to carry out the execution
                            without delay. They have repeatedly and earnestly announced such a
                            resolution. Moreover, the imperial government having persuaded itself
                            that, in order to insure the carrying out of the execution, it was
                            necessary that Austrian and Prussian troops should share in the
                            formation of the first reserve, had given to the imperial military
                            plenipotentiary, Major General Baron Rzikowski, the necessary orders for
                            the purpose, and empowered him to declare that, at the first notice from
                            Frankfort, Austria would be ready to send the number of troops asked for
                            to the lower Elbe. Such being the condition of things, therefore, the
                            imperial government cannot doubt that the German Bund will now have a
                            powerful and decisive reckoning with the system which has too long
                            prevailed with Copenhagen, and which infringes the rights and the
                            self-respect of Germany, and it will do its part in the faithful and
                            self-sacrificing performance of its duties to the Bund, that in future
                            there may be no further question of a disregard of the constitutional
                            rights of the duchies, which are under the protection of the Bund. It
                            acts, moreover, in the conviction that the non-German great powers will
                            not refuse their recognition of the justice of the demand, which the
                            Bund is entitled to enforce by the arrangement of 1851, and that,
                            therefore, peace will not be disturbed by the execution in Holstein. But
                            as the imperial government declines all responsibility for any further
                            delay in the carrying out of the execution, it cannot, on the other
                            hand, make itself responsible for a premature and forcible interference
                            in the succession question. For in this last question the right does not
                            present itself as clearly and openly as in the consitutional question.
                            On the contrary, the right is here a matter of dispute on all sides; and
                            however the London treaty may be judged, this much is certain, that this
                            treaty would never have been concluded if the Duke of Augustenburg had
                            possessed a clear and undoubted right to the succession of all Schleswig
                            and all Holstein. From the point of view of the Bund which did not
                            adhere to the London treaty, the question of succession must be
                            thoroughly and legally proved. Inasmuch as it is here, 1st, the question
                            of a formal judicial tribunal, the competency of which, moreover, cannot
                            extend itself beyond the limits of the Bund, it is not fitting to
                            forestall opposition by an <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> proceeding
                            against the possessor <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>; inasmuch as, 2d,
                            it is here the question of the political position which the Bund is to
                            take in a European question in its quality of a united power, it must
                            convince itself of the justice of the cause which it desires to sustain,
                            for it is certainly not allowable to confound simple wishes, even when
                            they spring from the purest patriotism, with positive rights. The more
                            decidedly, however, the imperial government recognizes such an
                            examination as the right duty of the Bund, the more carefully I think it
                            necessary, in this high assembly, to withhold myself from any expression
                            which might be considered as an opinion as to the worth of the different
                            claims which would be all put forward in case the London treaty should
                            not be carried out. Only in regard to the Duchy of Lauenburg, I will
                            observe that its connexion with the Danish crown can in no case admit of
                            a doubt. For the rest, I confine myself to calling attention to the wide
                            ramification and the great political extent of the question which would
                            then arise. Should it appear that the solution of these questions,
                            exclusively from the point of view of the law, would bring the
                            controversy into the same condition in which it would find itself
                            according to decisive state and international documents, even without
                            the London treaty, at least there is thus far no sufficient proof that
                            in this case Germany’s political interest would not suffer in the
                            end.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I think that there are two points which I must not leave
                            untouched <pb facs="0164" n="140" xml:id="pg_140"/> before I conclude.
                            It is often said, that the succession of King Christian IX is beyond all
                            doubt legitimate in the kingdom of Denmark itself, even if not in the
                            duchies. But it is a matter of fact, that the different remunerations
                            which preceded the London treaty of 1852, and the Danish succession law
                            of 1853 as well as the acquiescence of the Danish Diet, were only given
                            for the purpose and on the assumption that the different component parts
                            of the Danish monarchy should remain united under the sceptre of King
                            Christian IX. If this combination should go to pieces, the question of
                            the Danish throne succession revives in its whole extent. A second
                            circumstance, not to be overlooked, is, that the demand now heard in
                            Germany for a separation of the duchies from the kingdom of Denmark does
                            not agree at all with the legal position which the Duke of Augustenburg
                            claims for himself. In the protest of the hereditary Prince of
                            Augustenburg, in the year 1859, against the Danish law of succession, as
                            well as in the deed of renunciation which his father hastened to issue
                            at the news of the death of King Frederick VII, there are not only
                            claims upon Schleswig and Holstein, but eventual rights of inheritance
                            on other lands now governed by the house of Oldenburg. Here, therefore,
                            the possibility was not even excluded that Germany might throw itself
                            into a general war, only in order that the Danish monarchy might be
                            ruled by a Duke of Augustenburg, instead of a Duke of Glukeburg. (Cry of
                            bravo !—sensation.) I repeat, that I express no opinion about any point
                            of the succession question, but I only wish to warn against a too
                            one-sided judgment. Shall I now resume in a few words the leading
                            principles by which the imperial government intends to be guided in this
                            important affair? I have no hesitation in declaring that it lays the
                            greatest weight on the joint action of Austria and Prussia—that it is
                            firmly determined in this question, as in all others, to prove
                            unhesitatingly its regard for law and for treaties, and that it is not
                            less firmly determined within the boundaries of law to enforce with all
                            its power the interests of Germany and of our German countrymen in the
                            north. (Bravo! in the centre.)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is of course impossible for me to
                            communicate any news to you in regard to the current history of Europe.
                            The telegraph and the post inform you of the events as they rapidly
                            succeed each other, and it only remains for me from time to time to
                            furnish such commentaries as may help to elucidate the present and the
                            immediate future so far as my opportunities allow. I see nothing to
                            alter the opinion which I have for some time expressed in this
                            correspondence, that a war of some kind in Europe is imminent and almost
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p>As you have doubtless observed, the Diet at Frankfort, by a decisive
                            majority, rejected the Austrian-Prussian motion for taking possession of
                            the duchy of Schleswig in pledge for the enforcement of the stipulations
                            entered into by Denmark, as alleged by the two great German powers in
                            1851, upon which the London treaty of 1852, as is asserted, was
                            subsequently founded.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the Diet which voted against Austria and Prussia were in
                            favor of much more stringent measures against Denmark, and were disposed
                            to proceed at once to occupy Schleswig, with the hardly concealed
                            intention of severing that duchy as well as Holstein from all connexion
                            with the Danish kingdom. Had Austria and Prussia submitted to the will
                            of the majority of the Bund, the result would have been the formal
                            proclamation of the Duke of Augustenburg as legitimate sovereign of both
                            duchies, and his instalment by the whole power of the Bund.</p>
                        <pb facs="0165" n="141" xml:id="pg_141"/>
                        <p>But Austria and Prussia, holding to the London treaty, refused to submit
                            to the majority, on the ground that the Bund by its proposed course of
                            action was about to exceed the powers conferred upon it by its
                            constitution, and they announced the resolution to take the matter into
                            their own hands.</p>
                        <p>The demand upon the royal government at Copenhagen to revoke the November
                            constitution within forty-eight hours was then made by Austria and
                            Prussia.</p>
                        <p>The answer was couched in courteous and conciliatory terms, and
                            represented that it was impossible for the Danish government within the
                            term assigned to comply with the demand.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, unless constitutional government in Europe be a sorry farce,
                            it would be difficult to see how a king and his cabinet could revoke a
                            constitution in the manner proposed.</p>
                        <p>A convocation of the legislative bodies, and an understanding to propose
                            certain constitutional changes within a reasonable time, were, it seems,
                            not considered admissible. Nothing but the trampling of the new
                            constitution under foot by the monarch who had just signed it, would
                            satisfy the peremptory claim of the two great German powers.</p>
                        <p>The King refused to make the suggested <hi rend="italic">coup
                                d’etat,</hi> and 50,000 Austrians and Prussians are now on the march
                            to the Eider. The Danish minister at this court received his recall
                            yesterday. The Austrian and Prussian ministers at Copenhagen have
                            already been recalled.</p>
                        <p>It is calculated that by the 6th of February the Austrian-Prussian army
                            will be in position to commence operations. A formal ultimatum will then
                            be sent in, and on its refusal, which I take to be certain, the
                            Dannewerk will be attacked. Whether England or any other power will come
                            to the rescue or not, must soon be decided.</p>
                        <p>Strenuous efforts will be made by European diplomacy to arrange the
                            quarrel during the brief interval which must elapse before the
                            commencement of hostilities; but unless that diplomacy is infinitely
                            more successful than it has been on any occasion during the past year,
                            in any field, these efforts will be fruitless. Meantime the thaw which
                            has commenced, after a frost of unexampled severity and duration in this
                            part of Europe, has extended to the Danish regions. The Dannewerk, if
                            the present milder weather lasts, cannot be turned, but must be
                            assaulted in front, and unless I have been misinformed, the Danes will
                            make a most desperate resistance.</p>
                        <p>War once commenced, it is supposed that Austria and Prussia may consider
                            themselves no longer bound by a treaty, which the sword has already cut
                            asunder. It is hoped by these powers to localize the war, and keep it
                            within moderate dimensions; but I can hardly believe that Denmark will
                            be left to fight single-handed.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, while the rest of Europe looks on with dissatisfaction,
                            to say the least, at the aggressive attitude of Austria and Prussia, the
                            other states of Germany are discontented that <hi rend="italic">so
                                little</hi> is to be done against Denmark.</p>
                        <p>You will have observed that the Prussian Chamber of Deputies has refused,
                            by a vote of 275 to 51, the loan required by the government to carry on
                            its military operations.</p>
                        <p>It is not my province nor my purpose at this moment to go into any
                            details in regard to the long-standing conflict between the Prussian
                            ministry and the legislative body, but it is certain that the majority
                            of the Chamber would be desirous of a common action of the whole Bund
                            against Denmark, for the sake of definitely dismembering that state, and
                            placing both duchies under the Duke of Augustenburg. What the vote in
                            the Austrian Reichsrath may be upon the proposed ten-million florin loan
                            for the expenses of the Schleswig-Holstein expedition is doubtful.</p>
                        <p>To judge by the language of the report of the committee on the loan, an
                                <pb facs="0166" n="142" xml:id="pg_142"/> adverse vote seems very
                            possible. I append to this despatch, and recommend to your attention, a
                            few extracts from this document, which appeared in some of the yesterday
                            morning’s papers of Vienna. They paint the situation very clearly, and
                            will show the opinion of a large portion of the German people on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>As explanation of the intense and widespread excitement throughout the
                            German people upon the German-Holstein matter, it should always be kept
                            in mind that it is really the German democracy which, more or less
                            disguised, is making itself felt throughout these proceedings. The
                            national Verein, the assembly of German deputies, the national central
                            committee, the popular mass meetings, the popular ballads—these are the
                            machinery through which the spirit of German democracy is working and
                            pushing on the governments of the middle and smaller states in the
                            movements in favor of Schleswig and Holstein.</p>
                        <p>It is this democratic movement which Austria and Prussia are opposing.
                            “You lay down the principle,” said Minister Van Bismark the other day to
                            the opposition majority, in the Prussian House of Deputies, “that
                            Prussia is to sink or to become a domain of the national Verein.” “The
                            lesser German states,” said War Minister Van Roon, in the same debate,
                            “have tried to escape from the legitimate influences of the two German
                            great powers, through fear of some phantoms orother. These phantoms were
                            not called up by the minister resident, but by the party which you (of
                            the left) represent.” Of course, the question of questions is, how long
                            England can help coming to the assistance of Denmark? This question must
                            soon be solved, for Denmark unaided must cease to exist. But, so far as
                            I can learn, Denmark has no intention of yielding without a bloody
                            struggle.</p>
                        <p>The Austrian government is aware that at this moment its proceedings are
                            unpopular both in Austria itself and in the rest of Germany, while they
                            are looked upon with resentment and distrust by the other powers of
                            Europe. At the same time Austria sighs for peace, and neither government
                            nor people have a doubt that in peace alone is their only hope of
                            prosperity. But the government believes that by its present course it is
                            likely to insure the ultimate gratitude of Germany, and to solve the
                            Danish-German problem with the least possible amount of bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>How this result is to be obtained, I confess I do not clearly understand.
                            Even if the two powers succeed in occupying Schleswig, after
                            overpowering the resistance of the Danes, I do hot see that the
                            settlement is very near, or likely to be very satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                                against Schleswig; for there <pb facs="0167" n="143" xml:id="pg_143"
                                /> exists, according to the documents before us, no harmony in an
                                affair of the highest importance for the German Bund, with the
                                resolution of the German Bund assembly, and in consequence of this a
                                lamentable difference between Austria as first German Bund power and
                                the Bund threatens to arise, the extent and bearing of which are not
                                to be overlooked. Yet it is, according to the documents before us,
                                difficult to deny that Austria, in its present proceedings, is not
                                wishing not to make valid a justifiable position of its own as a
                                European great power, but that, according to its motions and
                                declarations in the Bund assembly of its intention to interfere only
                                for protection of the rights and dignity of Germany, she is acting
                                as a German power in deed, but without the will of the legitimate
                                organ of Germany, and that she is thus, in common with Prussia,
                                effectually exercising an unjustifiable guardianship over the rest
                                of Germany.</p>
                            <p>“The occupation of Schleswig is, moreover, under existing
                                circumstances, equal to the beginning of a war against Denmark, and
                                must impose at once severe burdens on the empire, for which neither
                                material recompense nor preponderating remuneration in moral or
                                political effects can be looked for, and it may increase
                                immeasurably our financial calamities. The imperial government
                                intends, indeed, by its proceedings to localize the danger of war to
                                the conflict with Denmark, and through the sacrifices necessary to
                                this end to avoid the still more severe misfortune of a general war
                                which, in consequence of the position taken up by a portion of the
                                German Bund states, might take place. Nevertheless there are neither
                                fixed points of reliance (<hi rend="italic">anhalts pückte</hi>)
                                that the resolutions of the Bund assembly are leading to a general
                                conflagration, nor sufficient guarantees that the proceedings of
                                Austria and Prussia, in their remoter consequences, are not actually
                                leading to an actual intervention of foreign nations; and at all
                                events, if that be true which the imperial government has hitherto
                                given as grounds of so high a military budget, that the protection
                                of the boundaries of Austria partly requires warlike preparations
                                even in peace, then the action of Austria in the north is affording
                                only a welcome assistance to manifold hostile attempts against her
                                boundaries.</p>
                            <p>“Austria has need of peace to its material palingenesis (<hi
                                    rend="italic">wiedergehust</hi>) and to the strengthening and
                                development of her constitution, and all her races are uniting in
                                the wish, not without pressing necessity, to allow the calamities of
                                war to be poured over them. Repeatedly has the House of Deputies
                                declared that Austria should keep on the defensive, and only follow
                                the policy of its interests, and the imperial government has
                                repeatedly declared that only this standpoint shall henceforth be
                                its guiding one. Now, however, an aggressive war is begun by
                                Austria, and really not in the interests of Austria.</p>
                            <p>“To all this is to be added, that in the whole attitude of the
                                imperial government in this question, that uncertainty of aim is
                                again found which, as a peculiarity so fraught with consequences,
                                has manifested itself in all European questions of the most recent
                                times.</p>
                            <p>“Shall the integrity of Denmark give the limitation, or shall the
                                legitimate rights of sovereignty in the Elbe duchies be the
                                appointed factor? Shall the fulfilment of Bund duties, in accordance
                                with treaties, direct Austria, or the mere political connivance with
                                interests of another nature? Neither of these two purposes has thus
                                far been decisively indicated or firmly maintained, and only one
                                thing seems clear, that the imperial government is giving to another
                                government for the attainment of its’ aims in the region of internal
                                policy a virtual, even if an involuntary assistance.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of despatches Nos. 51, 52, 53, 54, the latter containing
                            certificate for Baron Bothmer.</p>
                        <p>In my last I expressed the opinion that a war of some kind was imminent.
                            Since then hostilities on a considerable scale have commenced in the
                            Danish Peninsula, it would be idle for me to make any allusion to the
                            military events as they succeed each other, which the public prints
                            bring to you almost as soon as they are made known in Vienna; but I may
                            renew the assertion often made in this correspondence, that never did a
                            belligerent make war so unwillingly as does the government of Austria at
                            this moment.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the campaign is a kind of political and military paradox. War is
                            waged in order to prevent war. The enemy’s territory is invaded for the
                            sake of preserving it from dismemberment. Fire and sword are carried
                            into the very heart of Denmark, to save Denmark from national
                            extinction. The treaty of 1852, establishing the succession, is
                            recognized as sacred by the war-making powers, while at the same time
                            the question of the succession to Holstein is reserved. The Bund troops
                            enter Holstein to compel Christian IX, as member of the Bund to execute
                            its laws, while at the same time his claim to be a member of the Bund,
                            is disputed, and his representative excluded from the Diet at Frankfort.
                            Moreover, we learn to-day that the expedition undertaken by Austria and
                            Prussia against the vote of the majority of the Bund, with the definite
                            purpose of seizing Schleswig as a pledge of the revocation of the
                            November constitution, and the fulfilment of the stipulations of 1851,
                            has proceeded to invade Jutland, which has no more to do with the
                            Schleswig-Holstein dispute than Iceland has.</p>
                        <p>There are explanations of all these apparent inconsistencies, no doubt,
                            which are more or less satisfactory, according to the point from which
                            they are judged; and I suppose, too, that there can be no doubt that
                            Denmark has signally violated its own engagements, in regard to both
                            Schleswig and Holstein, that its rule in those duchies has been for
                            years characterized by systematic injustice and oppression towards the
                            German population, and that, sustained by the idea of the necessity of
                            its national existence to the most important powers of Europe, it has
                            reckoned on an impunity, which is now at an end.</p>
                        <p>As to the immediate future, so far as this government is concerned, it is
                            certain that the object is still to localize the war, and to confine it
                            to the Danish peninsula. The great powers of Germany wish a little war;
                            Denmark, on the other hand, naturally wishes a great war. This policy is
                            so obvious as to need no comment. Of course, Denmark, without the
                            assistance of Prance or England, or both, must be destroyed in the war
                            to the knife on which she is resolved. But she thinks herself more
                            likely to obtain that assistance by the boldest demeanor, and by the
                            most desperate resistance, while, on the other hand, by a vacillating
                            policy and a further submission to the demands of the enemy, she
                            considers her destruction as certain. The personal union between the
                            kingdom and the duchies, which might have been obtained yesterday from
                            Prussia and Austria, she considers as equivalent to dismemberment.
                            Indeed, such a union as existed between England and Hanover before the
                            accession of the present Queen of England, would hardly seem to imply
                            much additional strength to either of the realms united under the
                            sceptre of one and the same sovereign.</p>
                        <p>The question, whether the invasion of Jutland, on the one hand, and the
                            vigorous defence of the Düppel forts and Alsen, with the establishment
                            of a <pb facs="0169" n="145" xml:id="pg_145"/> blockade by Denmark of
                            the German ports, on the other, will suffice to bring England and France
                            into the field, must now soon be settled.</p>
                        <p>It seems certain that the object of England is to avert war—still more
                            certainly is this the desire of Austria. No power in the world has so
                            much to gain by peace and to lose by a general European conflict as this
                            empire. The words Gallicia, Venice, Hungary, are sufficient guarantees
                            in themselves for its pacific intentions. On the east, west, north and
                            south, open or secret enemies are ever lying in wait to take advantage
                            of any hostilities on a great scale in which Austria may be
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>I was present during the whole of the important and interesting debate
                            which occupied the Reichsrath, four days long, at the close of last
                            month, and was much struck by the eloquent and masterly manner in which
                            the discussion was conducted, both by the ministers and their adherents,
                            and the opposition. No one who witnessed those forensic encounters could
                            doubt the capacity of the Austrian nation for a full, constitutional,
                            and parliamentary life. But although the ministers obtained the
                            majority, it must be admitted, I think, that no party is thoroughly
                            satisfied with the character of the war. The liberals suspect the
                            Prussian alliance, repudiate the London treaty, and plant openly the
                            standard of the Augustenburger. The extreme conservatives, on the other
                            hand, look with dissatisfaction upon the waste of blood and of treasure
                            for the protection of oppressed nationalities by a power which is itself
                            composed of so many distinct nationalities, and all of them very apt to
                            raise the cry of oppression, and feel the inconsistency at this moment
                            of employing, as Austria is now doing, Polish, Italian, and Hungarian
                            regiments in Denmark, to rescue the oppressed Germans of
                            Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
                        <p>There is an uneasy feeling prevailing all classes of society that the
                            empire is drifting into a general and very dangerous war without a
                            clearly defined object. The attempt to avert a great war by making a
                            little one is thought by many to be a hazardous experiment.</p>
                        <p>Austria, therefore, is, in good faith, I think, desirous of peace, but
                            may not be taking the best means of arriving at such a consummation. The
                            policy of Prussia is mysterious, and excites, whether with reason or
                            not, much uneasiness and suspicion.</p>
                        <p>The probable attitude of England and France, now that Jutland has been
                            invaded, and the blockade formally declared by Denmark, excites a
                            general alarm. It is not my province to speculate as to the ultimate
                            position of those powers. England certainly wishes peace; but it wishes
                            Denmark to exist, and it is useless to deny that that existence is more
                            imperilled every day. England would be excessively endangered in its
                            commercial and general interests by a European war, and it can hardly
                            desire to reap the harvest which so many Englishmen have been so
                            lavishly sowing during its period of neutrality. Its conscience may
                            suggest that there may be noble-minded merchants as ready to build
                            swift-going Alabamas on one side of the Atlantic as the other, in
                            defiance of international law, and of every precept of morality, and
                            that the flag of Wurtemberg or Baden may be as convenient a standard for
                            neutrals to burn and plunder unarmed trading vessels under as that of
                            the slaveholders’ confederacy. It may be feared, too, that the United
                            States may be as slow as the English government has been to prevent such
                            crimes on the part of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>In brief, there is a prevailing impression that Denmark is sincerely
                            desirous of localizing the war; and while England is desirous of
                            avoiding all participation in it, the ambition of Prussia, the
                            determination of Denmark to defend what it considers its rights, and the
                            irresistible force of events, may bring about a general conflict before
                            the summer is over. I confess I do not exactly see the road by which
                            diplomacy will be able to bring the nations back again to peace, while
                            all seem just now to be travelling on the path that leads to war.</p>

                            <p>Under the significant circumstances in which the Reichsrath closes, I
                                feel the need, before your separation, of seeing you assembled
                                around my person. It is with special satisfaction that I see among
                                you the representatives of Transylvania, who fortunately entered
                                upon the path of a common constitutional action at the very moment
                                when the Tyrol celebrated with enthusiasm the anniversary of its
                                union with Austria. I recognized with real delight in these facts
                                the indication of a fruitful agreement with my intentions, and the
                                guarantee of a happy future. While the general position of the
                                empire was a subject of consolatory reflection, the famine which
                                afflicted certain parts of Hungary filled me with profound grief.
                                You have seconded with fraternal sympathy the efforts made by my
                                government to assist these unfortunate populations. Several
                                important legal dispositions for the internal organization of the
                                monarchy and for the realization of governmental principles have
                                been approved by you, and have received my sanction. Eastern
                                Gallicia and the Bukowina have seen the period for the realization
                                of their wishes respecting the railways which traverse them draw
                                near. The proposal which has been submitted to you on the subject of
                                the Transylvania railway has not, it is true, met with the solution
                                expected, but it is my wish, and it will be the care of the
                                government, that this important line should be executed. The
                                financial measure passed in the two Chambers has assured the
                                constitutional basis of the financial department during the period
                                of the administration. The vote which authorizes the collection of
                                the taxes of the past year, and the increase of the state credit,
                                have enabled the extraordinary expenses to be met. The preliminary
                                labors have already been commenced for settling the great question
                                of a reform of the taxes in the next session.</p>
                            <p>I have neglected nothing for preserving to the nation the precious
                                benefits of peace. It is the destiny of Austria, while holding
                                herself prepared to resist every possible attack, to maintain a
                                pacific language in the council of nations. The friendly character
                                of the relations of my government with the great powers of Europe
                                corresponds in a thoroughly satisfactory manner with this mission of
                                Austria. A crisis which has lasted for years in the relations of
                                Germany with Denmark has, however, come to a head, and, despite the
                                most conciliatory efforts of my government, warlike events have
                                resulted. As a German prince, I have participated in the military
                                measures necessary for the federal execution in Holstein. In
                                conformity with the resolutions of the Diet, and in accord with
                                Prussia, I have deemed it necessary to take possession of the Duchy
                                of Schleswig as a guarantee of the engagements constantly neglected
                                by Denmark. The heroic bravery and the admirable conduct of the
                                allied army in Schleswig-Holstein have obtained a prompt and
                                brilliant satisfaction of the rights and of the honor of Austria,
                                Prussia, and all Germany. The glorious success I have obtained, in
                                concert with my royal ally of Prussia—a success the object of which
                                is not ambition or conquest, but justice, as all Europe knows—will,
                                I hope, assure a happy future, without compromising the peace of the
                                world and <pb facs="0171" n="147" xml:id="pg_147"/> of our dear
                                country to the countries whose rights have long been attacked, and
                                for which we are fighting with Prussia. Surrounded by the
                                representatives of my empire, I doubly rejoice at the success with
                                which heaven has blessed the arms of Austria, and at the glorious
                                victories to which it has conducted our flag, for I know that my
                                faithful people are united with me in a sentiment of joy for the
                                proper appreciation of the brave men who have shed their blood for
                                our honor, united everywhere where the name of Austria has to be
                                upheld. In the face of the world you have rendered out of your own
                                mouths this testimony to our union, and that union we will preserve
                                as a precious treasure, for impregnable power is based upon it.
                                Austria has shown that in her reinvigorated form she has preserved
                                the good old spirit, and carried with her into the new liberal paths
                                of her governmental life the inheritance of her strength and her
                                glory.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I send you herewith a translation of the
                            document by which Austrian Poland is declared to be in a state of
                            siege.</p>
                        <p>This measure has taken few people in these regions by surprise, although
                            it would seem to have been unexpected in foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>By a reference to many of my despatches, and especially to No. 39, of
                            date November 24, 1863, with the accompanying documents, you will
                            observe that something very like a state of siege has for a long time
                            existed in Gallicia and Cracow. The formal proclamation of this
                            condition is not generally thought here to be premature, nor is it
                            connected, as I believe, with any secret political combinations with
                            other powers.</p>
                        <p>It has been notorious that the “national government,” concerning whose
                            doings I have often spoken in this correspondence, had extended its
                            net-work almost as thoroughly over the Austrian as over the Russian
                            portion of Poland. Taxes have been levied, troops enlisted, tribunals
                            erected, capital punishment decreed and inflicted by secret and
                            wonderfully constructed machinery, in defiance of the legal authorities,
                            with a precision almost without a parallel in history. An organized
                            assassination, directed by unseen authority, makes the whole population
                            shudder. In brief, although the religious strife which is so envenomed
                            in Russian Poland is absent in Gallicia—although the disaffected portion
                            of the population is supposed to be a minority of the whole, and
                            although the wrongs which have driven the Poles into revolt against the
                            Russian government have not been committed by the Austrian authorities,
                            yet the difference, after all, is only in the comparative intensity and
                            extent of the revolutionary fever in the one and the other
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>With so much of danger and of disaffection in its own domains, it may
                            well be supposed that the imperial royal government has not been
                            proceeding very cheerfully in the crusade against Denmark. To rescue one
                            nationality in the northwest of Europe from oppression by its sovereign
                            does not seem the most logical or congenial of tasks for an empire which
                            is itself compounded of a dozen different nationalities, many of them in
                            a state of chronic discontent, and one of. them in a state of rebellion,
                            so far advanced as to require the application of martial law. These
                            reflections are so obvious as to suggest themselves to every mind, and
                            hardly require to be dwelt upon. Nevertheless, Austria seems to be
                            wading every day, but against its will, into deeper and deeper water. If
                            the military process now on foot, which is expressly declared not to be
                            war, although some thousands have already been killed and wounded,
                            foreign territory <pb facs="0172" n="148" xml:id="pg_148"/> invaded,
                            great fortresses taken, and others besieged during its continuance,
                            really be not war, but a sensible series of measures taken to avert war,
                            then a most hazardous experiment will have been crowned with success. I
                            hardly anticipate such a result. What really lies at the bottom of the
                            great German movement against Denmark is, strange to say, the democratic
                            element as it is understood in Germany; and it is for the sake of
                            apparently assimilating, but in reality neutralizing, this dreaded
                            ingredient in every European organization that Prussia and Austria are
                            now sending their troops to the North sea.</p>
                        <p>The delay in the military operations since the retirement of the Danish
                            armies behind the forts of Duppel and the fortress Frederica will have
                            engaged your attention. I do not dwell on the military events as they
                            succeed each other, but it is well understood now that Jutland is to be
                            occupied by the allied armies. It is asserted, however, that this
                            province is occupied not as a permanent conquest, but for strategical
                            reasons, with a view to operations against the remaining portion of
                            Schleswig.</p>
                        <p>Thus Holstein was taken in “execution,” Schleswig was seized “as a
                            pledge,” and now Jutland is occupied “as a military basis,” but all
                            without war. It remains to be seen whether, if no foreign power
                            interferes, Denmark, after being entirely reduced to subjection, at an
                            enormous expenditure of blood and treasure, will be handed back again,
                            in whole or in part, to the Danish government.</p>
                        <p>If so, an example of moderation after success will be afforded which will
                            be a refreshing phenomenon in European history. The object still avowed
                            by the great German powers is the enforcement of the stipulations of
                            1851, as they understand them—a united Schleswig-Holstein, that is to
                            say, dissevered from Denmark, but placed in “personal union” under the
                            present King of Denmark.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Danish government considers the term “personal
                            union” as a mere euphuism for national dismemberment, and refuses to
                            hear of such an arrangement. It has recently informed the British
                            government, as is generally believed, that it will go into no conference
                            unless England will guarantee that Denmark shall be called upon to
                            concede nothing beyond the stipulations of 1851-‘52, which, as she
                            declares, forbid a united Schleswig-Holstein, and any separation of
                            Schleswig from the Danish kingdom. In case this guarantee should be
                            given, Denmark would be willing to go into a conference on the ground of
                            the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> before the invasion of Jutland and
                            of an armistice, pending negotiations for the revision and
                            interpretation of those stipulations. She declares that what England has
                            hitherto urged upon her is equivalent to that which her victorious
                            antagonist could impose after her complete subjugation. Under these
                            circumstances she would prefer to die with honor, sword in hand, to
                            becoming a party to her own destruction.</p>
                        <p>As it is perfectly obvious that these terms would not be listened to by
                            Austria and Prussia, to say nothing of the more violent portion of
                            Germany, it is believed that the English government has declined to come
                            to the rescue, and will permit the invasion of Jutland or any other
                            portion of Denmark. I am not aware that there is any organized party in
                            England ready to go to war with Germany in defence of Denmark, although
                            the politicians out of office are eloquent in their denunciations of the
                            perfidy and the imbecility manifested on this question by those who are
                            in.</p>
                        <p>Whether the sympathy of the governing classes in that country, which has
                            been exuberantly manifested for Denmark, as it was for the insurgent
                            slaveholders of America, will be more fruitful of armed intervention in
                            behalf of the Danes than it has hitherto been for the confederates,
                            remains to be seen. The prevailing opinion, but one which I do not
                            share, is that England will look on while Denmark is dismembered. In
                            this case I do not see how the victorious powers could resist the
                            pressure upon them from the more advanced part of Germany in favor of
                            the Augustenburger. At present, however, the chances <pb facs="0173"
                                n="149" xml:id="pg_149"/> of the pretender to the duchies seem to
                            have diminished. At any rate his claims are ostentatiously thrust into
                            the background by Austria and Prussia.</p>
                        <p>But popular opinion in England is, after all, an important factor in the
                            problem; and there is a conviction spreading that England has been
                            talking too long and too loud against Germany, and in behalf of Denmark,
                            to allow her to wash her hands and fold her arms. The ridicule which is
                            manifested towards the English policy on continental questions may end
                            in piercing the national stoicism; a feeling of shame and generous
                            indignation may break forth in action, and I almost expect to find
                            England taking the field for her slight but valorous ally at the last
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>Meantime the delay in the military operations is thought, on the whole,
                            to have been rather beneficial than otherwise to Denmark. She has had
                            time to strengthen the fortifications of Duppel and Frederica. The
                            advancing season enables her to make use of her fleets. The blockade of
                            the German ports, and the capture of German trading vesssels, will
                            inflict much damage on her enemy before the Austrian squadron, which, as
                            I understand, has just been ordered into the North sea, comes to their
                            protection; and, moreover, the confusion in the councils of the German
                            confederation has been growing almost hopeless. In the Diet at Frankfort
                            everybody seems to be in a minority on every question. Every motion is
                            negatived, every party is conquered without any conquerors, while puzzle
                            and perplexity reign supreme.</p>
                        <p>One would think that the measures taken for shortening and localizing the
                            war really contemplated its perpetration and expansion; and I for one am
                            not yet a convert to the theory of preventing a great war by making a
                            little one.</p>
                        <p>“Has it come to this,” exclaims a leading journal of Vienna this morning,
                            “that no German merchant vessel can venture into the North sea; that the
                            insignificant Denmark is again blockading the mouth of the Elbe; that
                            Germany is in a state of bewilderment; that the Diet, reflecting the
                            universal helplessness, is bringing on itself the scorn and contempt of
                            foreign nations; that, in fine, while we are avoiding the Scylla of a
                            general crisis, we are in danger of being sucked into the
                            Napoleon-Congress Charybdis? ”</p>
                        <p>We had a telegraphic report this morning that a Danish cruiser is lying
                            in wait off the mouth of the Elbe for the Hamburg New York steam-packet
                            Germania. I have been informed, however, I know not with what accuracy,
                            that these vessels have been sold to a Russian company. At any rate the
                            river’s mouth is considered to be effectually blockaded.</p>
                        <p>To resume in a single phrase what I have been dilating upon in this
                            despatch, there is a growing popular indignation in England that Austria
                            and Prussia should be allowed to crush little Denmark. There is a
                            growing popular indignation in Germany that they are not crushing her
                            fast enough or thoroughly enough. Whether such a widespread and
                            antagonistic excitement between two such mighty peoples as the English
                            and the Germans is likely to be suppressed without blood-letting, you
                            can judge as well as I can.</p>
                        <p>The prospects of peace in Europe do not seem to be very promising this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>For many months the kingdom of Poland has been the scene of
                                disastrous occurrences. Gallicia is powerfully moved by sympathy for
                                its neighbor, and <pb facs="0174" n="150" xml:id="pg_150"/> that
                                province, generally so peaceful, and moving in the paths of law and
                                order, is agitated to its centre.</p>
                            <p>My government has conscientiously performed its international duties
                                in the face of this condition of things, put in force the existing
                                laws, and given that leniency and forbearance full sway which was
                                thought fitted to calm the excited minds and turn the misguided from
                                their unhappy enterprises. The results have not met expectation.</p>
                            <p>Treasonable associations have been organized within the limits of my
                                empire; enlistments and extortions for the support of the
                                insurrection are uninterruptedly continued; the personal safety and
                                property of the inhabitants of the land and the common weal are
                                endangered, and the legal order seriously threatened. A
                                revolutionary power, secret in its action, the end and aim of which
                                are directed against the safety and integrity of Austria, usurps a
                                formal sovereignty in my realms; demands taxes and other
                                contributions; puts its organs under oath and allegiance; and seeks
                                to secure obedience to, and execution of, its decrees through terror
                                and every other means, not recoiling even from assassination.
                                Numerous facts indicate that the revolutionary parties are now
                                preparing to make very soon my kingdom of Gallicia and Cracow the
                                scene of open hostilities.</p>
                            <p>Such a condition of things cannot be allowed. Conscious of my duty as
                                ruler towards a land which forms an integral part of my empire, the
                                inhabitants of which in the most decisive majority are among my most
                                faithful subjects, I have found myself, after the fruitless
                                employment of all the means offered by the existing laws, forced to
                                decree such extraordinary measures for Gallicia as may secure
                                internal peace and increased protection to person and property.</p>
                            <p>People of Gallicia: That these measures may very soon be dispensed
                                with is my lively wish. Its gratification depends essentially upon
                                your concurrence.</p>
                            <p>I cherish the firm faith that the efforts of my government to secure
                                obedience to the laws and calm the disturbed condition of the land
                                will not fail of your aid. My care is ever for your weal; and I am
                                determined to spare no effort again at the earliest possible moment
                                to secure to your land the blessings of legal order, and thereby the
                                pledge of the general welfare.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is not from negligence that I have
                            written but little of late concerning the German-Danish war. All that
                            occurred to me to say in regard to the causes and probable issue of the
                            conflict I have already said. The events both at the seat of war and at
                            the seat of the conferences reach you regularly, almost as soon as they
                            are made known here; and I suppose that you have not much leisure for
                            any academic disquisitions which it might occur to me to make on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The government of Austria is very moderate, for it went into the war with
                            reluctance, in obedience to German popular pressure, and to its
                            instinctive rivalry with Prussia, and will be glad to conclude peace now
                            that its share in the military events has been so satisfactory to its
                            military pride.</p>
                        <p>Prussia, on the other hand, whose troops have also fought with
                            unquestionable <pb facs="0175" n="151" xml:id="pg_151"/> success, seems
                            no longer to have any urgent motive to continue the war, because any
                            secret schemes of annexation that might he entertained would appear for
                            the present impracticable. It is, therefore, for the two great powers,
                            who have now Denmark at their feet, to dictate the terms of peace; but
                            the Bund, although it was allowed to take no part in the war, will
                            probably exercise sufficient moral pressure on its two principal members
                            to prevent these terms being extravagantly generous.</p>
                        <p>The Augustenburg, with his pretensions, seems to have vanished from the
                            scene, and is now rarely mentioned. The duchies, I suppose, will be
                            united in what is called an administrative and political union, and will
                            be dissevered definitely from Denmark. After this has been thoroughly
                            accomplished, the personal sovereignty over them will be conferred upon
                            the Danish king, as Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg. This is
                            simply the dismemberment, and one would think annihilation, of the
                            monarchy; and it is probable that the mass of the population, and all
                            the most eminent persons in Denmark, would prefer a union with Sweden
                            and Norway, under the Swedish monarch, to such an arrangement. It is
                            probable, however, that England, among whose traditions is a strong
                            hostility to the Scandinavian union, would prevent such a consummation
                            by force, if force should be necessary. That both shores of the Skager
                            Rack and the Katte-Gat should be under one crown has been usually
                            thought contrary to her naval and commercial interests. Whether this be
                            an antiquated notion or not, it would, perhaps, still be acted upon. It
                            is true that there are “personal unions” not inconsistent with the idea
                            of national integrity. That between Sweden and Norway, even with the
                            addition of Denmark, would be a conceivable empire, for in this case
                            there is not, nor would there be, an overpowering extraneous force to
                            counteract that necessary centripetal tendency which alone keeps all
                            organized bodies from dissolution. But in the personal union, as likely
                            to be constituted between the Danish states and the continental
                            provinces of Holstein and Schleswig, what central force could be found
                            in the kingdom of one million inhabitants to overcome the enormous
                            attraction of the great German confederacy with forty millions of people
                            upon these duchies? I forbear to extend further these very obvious
                            reflections.</p>
                        <p>The reluctance of the two great western powers, especially England, to
                            engage in European war, is among the most significant signs of the
                            times. Nations, or rather governments, act from instinct oftener,
                            perhaps, than we at first sight imagine; and there is probably an
                            instinctive uneasiness on the part of England, that, in case of a
                            general war in which she should be belligerent and the United States
                            neutral, the wonderful discoveries in the doctrine of neutrality made by
                            some of her jurists and statesmen, together with the practical
                            application thereof by ship-building members of Parliament, and others
                            to the commercial advantage of England, and the great injury of American
                            citizens, might be turned against herself. It is true that, in the words
                            of a famous English statesman, England does not pique herself on being
                            logical; and it does not follow, because she has practically allowed
                            mutinous slaveholders who were without seaports or ships to make use of
                            the Clyde and Mersey as a basis of naval operations against a power with
                            which she was at peace, that she would tolerate a swarm of Alexandras
                            and Alabamas issuing from New York and Boston, under Bavarian or Saxon
                            colors, to burn her merchantmen on the high seas. Nevertheless, such
                            complications might occasion her considerable inconvenience, and the
                            reflection on such possibilities strengthens her pacific inclinations,
                            so far as this side of the Atlantic is concerned. The two western powers
                            have been moving in a vicious circle, as we all know, in regard to the
                            United States ever since their hasty and ill-judged bestowal by solemn
                            proclamation of maritime belligerent rights on a mutiny which had no
                            more pretensions to be maritime than Poland or Wirtemberg. It is true,
                            in the admiring words of a distinguished member of the British cabinet,
                            that the slaveholders have succeeded <pb facs="0176" n="152"
                                xml:id="pg_152"/> “in creating a navy,” but it has been created for
                            them entirely in England, and it sails from English ports alone; and it
                            has been engendered by that clandestine connexion of England with the
                            mutiny, of which an organized piracy is thus the sole fruit.</p>
                        <p>I have only to repeat that the Imperial Austrian government is disposed
                            to peace, and seems to me by no means desirous of destroying the kingdom
                            of Denmark. I am informed by the minister of foreign affairs that an
                            important paper has been sent to the Imperial Russian government from
                            the principal estates (<hi rend="italic">staude</hi>) of Schleswig and
                            Holstein, signed, as I understand, by the President and many notable
                            members of these bodies, in which a separation of these duchies from
                            Denmark is strongly deprecated, and in which an elaborate and cogent
                            historical argument on the succession question is made, to the effect
                            that even should the treaty of 1852 be set aside, the claims of the
                            Augustenburg are entirely inadmissible, and that even had the chief of
                            that branch not renounced his claims, they would be of little value, and
                            far behind the pretensions of the Duke of Oldenburg and the Emperor of
                            Russia. Such, as well as I could follow it, was the purport of the
                            paper, and I understood the Imperial Russian minister to maintain very
                            similar opinions. In the judgment of the Austrian government a
                            compromise is inevitable, and to break down the arrangements of 1852
                            would be merely to open the door to endless litigation, out of which
                            there could be no issue, even after a general war, but a fresh
                            compromise. This, however, is manifestly not the feeling of the middle
                            and lesser German states.</p>
                        <p>The avowed object of the two German powers, now acting, as I am informed,
                            in perfect harmony, is stated to be to take such guarantees from Denmark
                            as to prevent the repetition of her injustice to the German inhabitants
                            of the duchies, and to compel her to observe the stipulations of
                            1851-’52, which preceded the London treaty.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the movements of the Austrian fleet, of which there has
                            been recently so much mention in the public prints and in the British
                            Parliament, the minister informed me that the instructions given to the
                            commander of that fleet on the 9th March were to enter the North sea,
                            but not to enter the Baltic; and that no fresh instructions had since
                            been given. He added, that it would not be possible for the fleet to
                            pass the sound, because there was but one ironclad ship in the squadron,
                            and because the Danish batteries could easily sink any wooden ship
                            attempting that narrow passage.</p>
                        <p>I do not understand, however, why it would not be easy enough for any
                            fleet to enter the Baltic by way of the Great Belt, which is, I believe,
                            eight or ten English miles in width.</p>
                        <p>The present appearances are supposed to be pacific; and it is expected
                            that the armistice upon the basis of the evacuation of Jutland on the
                            one side, and of Aslen, together with the raising of the blockade on the
                            other, will soon be established, and it is hoped that if hostilities are
                            once suspended it will be difficult to resume them.</p>
                        <p>But it is idle for me to speculate upon matters concerning which you will
                            receive direct information long before any despatch of mine can reach
                            you. The best I can do is to keep you apprised of the feelings of the
                            imperial royal government from time to time.</p>
                        <p>The opinion at present is, that a general European war will be averted. I
                            confess I do not understand how this is to be accomplished, except by
                            the practical dissolution of the Danish monarchy, nor how the English
                            government can, at the last moment, refrain from stepping in with the
                            armed band to prevent such a catastrophe. If the two German great powers
                            succeed in satisfying the German aspirations in regard to
                            Schleswig-Holstein without exciting hostilities on the part of other
                            powers, a very difficult task will have been accomplished.</p>
                        <pb facs="0177" n="153" xml:id="pg_153"/>
                        <p>Neither the merging of Danish nationality in the Scandinavian union, nor
                            that other scheme which is occasionally broached, of a voluntary
                            entrance of all Denmark into the Gorman confederation, by which Germany
                            would become a considerable maritime power, would be in accordance with
                            the traditional policy of England. Yet both projects are, to say the
                            least, possible.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Without waiting for a reply to my
                            despatch, No. 62, of date 28th June last, I venture a second appeal on
                            the same subject.</p>
                        <p>The want of accurate telegraphic intelligence concerning American affairs
                            at this legation, and of others far removed from the sea-coast, is
                            really a very serious practical evil. The telegraph has every where
                            superseded the post; but for us it may be said that the post has been
                            abolished and no substitute provided.</p>
                        <p>Two or three lines twice a week in the corner of a local newspaper,
                            containing generally the most malicious or most improbable fiction that
                            can be culled from the telegraphic budget, furnished by the English
                            purveyors in America to the London press, make up our history. The mass
                            of European readers see little more of United States affairs than these
                            morsels, and thus public opinion is hopelessly depraved. This is
                            comparatively of very little consequence; but it is not an indifferent
                            matter that a representative of the United States should thus always be
                            ignorant of the condition of his own country. Yet as it takes the post
                            always from four to seven days to overtake the telegraph, our despatches
                            and American journals never arrive until after a new telegraphic fiction
                            or enigma has already destroyed their value.</p>
                        <p>I doubt whether there is an individual at home or abroad more profoundly
                            convinced than I am as to the certainty of the ultimate success of our
                            cause, and as to the impossibility of a triumph for the slaveholders’
                            attempt to destroy our great republic, but it is not sufficient for a
                            representative of the United States simply to denounce <hi rend="italic"
                                >a priori</hi> as improbable, and often as ludicrously false, such
                            statements of facts as are presented to the public.</p>
                        <p>In order to maintain the dignity of his office, and to exercise a proper
                            influence among his colleagues, and among those disposed to make earnest
                            and friendly inquiries as to the state of our affairs, he ought always
                            to be furnished with a full statement of the truth, and this can only be
                            done by forwarding to him by the semi-weekly steamer a telegraphic
                            summary of intelligence. Otherwise he must continue to be in perfect
                            ignorance of the current history of his own country, at a moment when
                            that history, both in itself and for its influence on all human affairs,
                            is far the most important subject now occupying the attention of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>It is no exaggeration to say that since I have been here, we have always
                            been under the influence of some perversion, exaggeration, or absolute
                            fraud, perpetrated by the telegraph working in the interest of our
                            enemies.</p>
                        <p>It is superfluous to point out how such a condition might at times be of
                            serious practical inconvenience. Suppose—what might be the case—it were
                            necessary for a United States minister to repel a strenuous argument in
                            favor of interference by a foreign government in our affairs; and
                            suppose, while he was indignantly repelling such a pretension, he were
                            informed that General Grant <pb facs="0178" n="154" xml:id="pg_154"/>
                            was a prisoner in Richmond, that his whole army had capitulated, and
                            that Jefferson Davis was established in Washington. He would, of course,
                            denounce the telegram stating such intelligence as impudently false, and
                            know it to be so, but the telegram would still be believed abroad. This
                            is no monstrous imagination. Two years ago, while stating the condition
                            of our affairs to one of my most influential colleagues, and one very
                            friendly to the United States government, he banded me the morning
                            paper, which I bad happened not to have read. It contained a telegram
                            that General M’Clellan had just signed an unconditional surrender of his
                            whole army, General Lee insisting on an absolute capitulation.</p>
                        <p>Of course I felt this to be false, and denounced it as false; but how
                            could I prove the falsehood? It was not till four days later that our
                            journals arrived, by which the true condition of things became known.
                            Meantime we had lived under the influence of the poison.</p>
                        <p>But not to enlarge any farther on this subject, I beg to add that I have
                            just been reading with great interest your communication to Mr. Chandler
                            on the project of an inter-continental telegraph, and I find one or two
                            passages so striking in themselves, and so confirmatory of the point I
                            urge, that I must quote them:</p>
                        <p>“It would be as easy now to dispense with the steam engine, on land or on
                            sea, in the business of commerce, in social intercourse, or in political
                            affairs, as it would be to forego the use of the telegraph; to be
                            without it is to be isolated.” (p. 17.)</p>
                        <p>And again: “The United States cannot hope to inspire respect, confidence
                            and good will, abroad, and so secure peace with foreign states, without
                            using the magnetic telegraph when it is possible.” (p. 23.)</p>
                        <p>Once more, I appeal to you not to leave us thus hopelessly isolated, and
                            to provide us with the means of inspiring respect, confidence and good
                            will abroad.</p>
                        <p>It would be very easy, and not ruinously expensive, to send a telegraphic
                            summary twice a week from New York to London, thence to be telegraphed
                            by our legations to the legations on the continent. It is true that this
                            summary is not of so much consequence at Paris and London, for two
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. The post to them is but a few hours behind the telegraph.</p>
                        <p>2. The telegram in the public papers is so copious, that it is possible
                            for them to make a shrewd guess at the state of affairs, and to
                            discriminate between what is true and what is false; but for all other
                            United States legations it is of vital importance.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches Nos. 77 and 78, of 14th and 16th July,
                            respectively, which reached me on the 4th of this month.</p>
                        <p>I am encouraged to make one more effort towards obtaining a semi-weekly
                            telegraphic summary of American intelligence by your statement, that
                            “expense is not reckoned among the hindrances of the enterprise.” And
                            further, that in case I should be able to indicate a feasible system,
                            you would cheerfully adopt it.</p>
                        <p>The subject at any rate gives me an opportunity of expressing some
                            thoughts <pb facs="0179" n="155" xml:id="pg_155"/> which may not
                            entirely be without interest to yon; and as, in my private letter of
                            date August 2, I set down in a familiar and sincere way my latest
                            impressions of cisatlantic politics, I have nothing special to say about
                            them to-day.</p>
                        <p>I would, then, in the first place, in answer to some of your observations
                            in despatch No. 77, repeat that it is not primarily nor mainly for the
                            sake of influencing the public opinion of Europe that I desire to be,
                            supplied with authentic intelligence by the <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
                            vehicle which now brings news. It is for <hi rend="italic">my own
                                information</hi> that I require it—speaking of myself as the head of
                            a United States legation, and as an American citizen immovable in the
                            faith that our republic is indivisible, but intensely interested in the
                            passing events of the great revolutionary drama as they reveal
                            themselves</p>
                        <p>The American civil war—I care not what may be said on the subject to-day
                            in either hemisphere—is simply a revolt of slaveholders against the
                            democratic principle. As such the event will be recorded so long as
                            history shall last. The slaveholders revolted because the people chose a
                            new set of servants pledged to restrain slavery, instead of the series
                            of agents who for forty years had been doing their best to strengthen
                            and extend it. The success of this attempt to perpetuate by force of
                            arms the slave oligarchy and to annihilate the American people is
                            impossible, although the struggle may cost more time, money and blood
                            before the democratic principle has thorougly re-established itself over
                            our whole territory. These essential facts are <hi rend="italic"
                                >now</hi> accepted by every thinker in Europe. They are also
                            instinctively but dimly perceived and firmly believed in by the great
                            unrepresented, voiceless mass of humanity in Europe; the toiling
                            millions, whose part in life, according to the European scheme, is to be
                            governed, and to hew wood and draw water for those who govern. Those
                            whose future is so deeply interested in the preservation of our republic
                            refuse to believe that it has ceased to exist.</p>
                        <p>The thinkers of Europe, accordingly, so far as I know, without a solitary
                            exception, and the laboring classes, wish success to the American
                            republic. The dominant classes—with individual and illustrious
                            exceptions—together with the idlers, who are unwilling or unable to form
                            opinions for themselves, desire the success of those who are attempting
                            its destruction. The opinions held by this influential minority in
                            regard to the American war are manufactured for them by their public
                            preceptors who make up what is called the public opinion of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Now there was a time when this tribunal was regarded by us almost with
                            reverence. That day is, I trust, gone forever. In regard to American
                            affairs, the result of a final analysis of that opinion is simply
                            this:</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that the great American democratic republic should be de
                            stroyed; an energetic and admirably organized domestic insurrection is
                            attempting its destruction; therefore, that insurrection should be
                            encouraged in every possible way.</p>
                        <p>No syllogism can be plainer. It would, therefore, be beneath the dignity
                            of the American government publicly to combat these sentiments, or to
                            offer any reply to the stale commonplaces about the “causeless war,”
                            “the miserable war,” “the hopeless war,” with which our ears have been
                            stunned these three years. This <hi rend="italic">crambe repetita</hi>
                            is food made by those who feed upon it. One day it will be discovered
                            whether it was wholesome philosophy and philanthrophy, or childish
                            jargon. We have now only to do, not to argue. Every blow upon the head
                            of the rebellion tells with still greater weight upon its foreign
                            sympathizers. So long as we are under a cloud we shall be subjected to
                            calumny, insult and wrong. When the commonwealth has re-established
                            herself she will again be respected as the “grand republic;” and her
                            friendship will be duly prized by those who at present most
                            ostentatiously parade their “neutrality” between her and her assassins,
                            and who exemplify that neutrality in so many astounding ways, In Europe,
                            to be powerful is to be venerated— <pb facs="0180" n="156"
                                xml:id="pg_156"/> to be weak is to be trampled upon. Therefore, the
                            public opinion of Europe is, and ought to be, of comparative
                            indifference to us.</p>
                        <p>The telegraphic summary furnished to Europe by our enemies is, of course,
                            compounded and flavored to suit that public opinion. It is the function
                            of cooks to please the palate of their masters and customers. I have
                            already given you a variety of specimens of the manner in which the
                            events of our war, as they succeed each other, are travestied by the
                            telegraph. I might easily send you a hundred more. A century hence,
                            indeed, if an antiquary should amuse himself with collecting from German
                            newspapers a complete series of semi-weekly telegrams, he would be
                            amazed at the trivial and grotesque manner in which the history of the
                            great anti-slavery war of America was presented during its continuance
                            to the most philosophical and thoughtful nation of Europe. Therefore it
                            is that I do not urge upon you to provide for the European public—or for
                            regular publication at all—the summary for which I most earnestly plead.
                            It is for the legations, not for the public, that information is needed.
                            It is my deliberate opinion that a representative of the United States
                            cannot properly discharge his functions, or maintain his official
                            dignity, if he be kept in profound ignorance of passing events at home,
                            when these events are more important than any others in the world. Yet
                            in that ignorance I have existed ever since I have been here.
                            Practically the post has been abolished by the telegraph, and for
                            American affairs there is no telegraph. The choice is between being
                            supplied by government or remaining in the dark, for the meagre
                                scrap—<hi rend="italic">two lines or so in length</hi>—which finds
                            its way twice a week into the local journals of the continent on the
                            arrival of the steamers at Queenstown, is usually a fiction or an
                            enigma.</p>
                        <p>You are very right in saying that the government is not responsible for
                            telegrams published in Europe, and dated New York. Any one who knows or
                            cares anything about the matter at all is aware that, on the contrary,
                            they are concocted by the enemies of the government. But this is a
                            matter of comparative little consequence. After all, foreign governments
                            and their agents look to the accredited representatives of the United
                            States to learn the truth, whether that truth be agreeable or
                            distasteful. But the world moves so fast in these days that there is not
                            time to wait from five to seven days for correct information—and that is
                            the difference at Vienna, so far as American news is concerned, between
                            post and telegraph. Therefore, the representatives should always be
                            informed by the telegraph. You will say that the world ought to be
                            willing to wait, and to make up its mind deliberately upon such great
                            events as those now transacting on our continent. But I have been struck
                            with the indifference which prevails, and the very superficial amount of
                            information which suffices in these regions as to our affairs.
                            Therefore, the little seed sparsely sown upon the rich soil of European
                            prejudice have ripened into the abundant harvest, which now waves
                            triumphantly all over its surface. It is a prevailing belief in Europe,
                            at which a loyal American, who believes in his country and in human
                            freedom, smiles, that our republic ought to be destroyed, and is
                            destroyed, and that sooner or later we shall acknowledge a truth which
                            Europe, being wiser than we are, has for a long time known.</p>
                        <p>But this, although a prevailing, is by no means the universal creed. I
                            repeat that I find no difficulty in impressing those whose powers of
                            thought I most respect, and whose opinions I most value, with the
                            sentiments religiously entertained by the vast majority of the American
                            people as to the character and the inevitable result of this war. There
                            are many who would always be interested in any fresh intelligence that I
                            could furnish to sustain my views.</p>
                        <p>I notice with great respect your objection that the United States
                            government should beware, lest by sending intelligence which might be
                            sometimes inaccurate, mischievous, or insufficient, it should lay itself
                            open to the charge of misleading public opinion in Europe. But I answer
                            that your intelligence would <pb facs="0181" n="157" xml:id="pg_157"/>
                            not be prepared for the foreign public at all. It would be intended for
                            the agents and servants abroad of the American people, and it might, I
                            think, be safely left to the discretion of those agents to make a proper
                            use of their information. Why should they not be as discreet in regard
                            to their intelligence by telegraph as in regard to that which comes by
                            post? The difference is simply that letters or newspapers by the
                            ordinary conveyance are as antiquated when they arrive as a letter would
                            be if sent from Washington to New York by a messenger travelling on
                            foot, instead of by the railway. Of course what I should most crave
                            would be a summary of facts of the past half week, made up under your
                            eye by some one in whom you confide, and sent from Washington on the
                            morning of the departure of each regular steamer on Wednesdays and
                            Saturdays. If anything of grave importance occurs on the day when the
                            steamer is touching at Halifax, that also should be sent in a separate
                            telegram. The word “official” might be appended to any statement that
                            was officially known at the time of writing. Where that word was not
                            added it would be inferred that the writer believed the statement made,
                            but did not vouch for it. The character of the person writing the
                            telegraphic letter would be the best guarantee. Let simply a man of
                            intelligence and honesty put down those things which <hi rend="italic"
                                >are known</hi> to have occurred during the half week. I am aware
                            that there is always a margin for mistakes and self-deception, and the
                            recipient of the intelligence will always make proper allowances. But
                            you must remember the immense advantage which the reader will have in
                            knowing that what he reads is sent sincerely for his instruction; that
                            it is only sent in the interest of truth; that it is intended neither to
                            extenuate facts nor to set them down in malice, nor to invent success,
                            nor suppress disaster; not to affect the market price either of
                            confederate loans or United States bonds; not to favor the views of
                            European stock jobbers or parliamentary stump orators; but simply to
                            enable the representatives of a great and much calumniated nation to do
                            their duty undisturbed by the machinations of its enemies.</p>
                        <p>The source of the information and the object for which it would be sent
                            would insure its healthfulness. An occasional error would not be so
                            mischievous as the perpetual atmosphere of errors, delusions, and
                            ignorance in which we now exist. The telegraph letter should be sent
                            from Queenstown at once to the chiefs of the various United States
                            legations in England, France, and the continent, in order that they
                            might receive it on the day of the steamer’s arrival there. I repeat
                            that it should be left to their discretion to make a proper use of their
                            information. The governments to which they are accredited and their
                            influential colleagues would always be interested to be informed of
                            facts which were both new and authentic. The public press, which is
                            often rather indifferent than hostile to the United States, and in many
                            regions friendly, might occasionally receive an indirect communication
                            of facts, when in the interest of truth such communications seemed
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>Should it not be found feasible to send this telegraphic letter from
                            Washington, for the reasons suggested in your despatches Nos. 77 and 78,
                            it would surely not be impossible to discover some trustworthy and
                            intelligent person in New York who might be charged with preparing it.
                            For example, the telegraphic despatches regularly sent by the Secretary
                            of War to General Dix supply the whole American public with information.
                            Those very telegrams published in the American journals reach us in that
                            way by post many days later than they might do if sent directly to the
                            legations by telegraph. You can have no idea of the effect, both
                            irritating and paralyzing, produced on even the most robust organization
                            by the manner in which all the information of the great events in which
                            we are all so deeply interested is thus poisoned at its source.</p>
                        <p>But I have already said so much on this subject that I do not like to say
                            more. I entreat you, simply by way of experiment, to cause such a simple
                            summary to be sent either from Washington or New York. If it works ill
                            it can <pb facs="0182" n="158" xml:id="pg_158"/> be discontinued after a
                            fair trial. I think the official stamp very desirable, but not
                            indispensable. Were I rich enough, so important do I consider fresh
                            intelligence, I would employ a private friend to send me such a
                            telegraphic letter twice a week so long as I occupied an official
                            position abroad; one whom I could trust not wilfully to deceive me, and
                            not simple enough to swallow every half hour’s wonder, whether of
                            victory or disaster, as gospel truth; and I think I should have no
                            difficulty in finding such a person. The three days’ grace which such a
                            chronicler has for sifting the truth, would preserve him generally from
                            very grave errors.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            receipt of your despatches, Nos. 79 and 80, of July 26 and August 1,
                            respectively.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the accurate and interesting intelligence which they
                            convey as to military affairs. I ought to add, however, as further
                            illustration of the. subject of which I have so often spoken, that the
                            despatch of August 1 did not reach me until after telegraphic fragments,
                            such as they were, up to the 10th of August, had been printed in the
                            public journals here.</p>

                            by assault has occasioned more than usual delight throughout Europe, to
                            judge from the prevailing tone of the press, and has caused the display
                            of more than the usual amount of wisdom in deductions and prophecies. Of
                            course, the campaign is at an end. Washington is to be immediately
                            captured, and the “north” (whatever that may be) is about to beg for
                            peace, which will be granted only on ignominious conditions, and so on.
                            The “negotiations” at Niagara Falls are also gravely commented upon, as
                            if they had been conferences preliminary to a treaty of peace between
                            two independent nations, instead of a shallow electioneering trick.</p>
                        <p>But I will not weary you with such discussions. We are hoping to hear
                            such news from Atlanta and Mobile, and at a later moment, from Virginia,
                            as will justify to the world the confidence which all loyal Americans
                            feel as to the issue of our great struggle, and which seems overweening
                            to those only who never give themselves the trouble to examine the
                            reasons on which it is founded.</p>
                        <pb facs="0183" n="159" xml:id="pg_159"/>
                        <p>The incident of the past week in Vienna has been the visit of the King of
                            Prussia to his Imperial Royal Austrian Majesty. The King arrived on
                            Saturday, the 20th, at the palace of Schonbrunn. On the 21st there was a
                            play performed at the private theatre in the palace, to which the higher
                            officials and the court society of Vienna, together with the diplomatic
                            corps, were invited. At an interval between the acts a circle was held
                            in an adjoining drawing-room, at which the foreign ministers were
                            presented to the King of Prussia. The visit of his Majesty was prolonged
                            until the 25th, but the diplomatic body had no further part in the
                            festivities in honor of the royal guest.</p>
                        <p>The relations between the courts of Austria and Prussia are supposed to
                            be very cordial; but it is not believed that any very grave negotiations
                            took place during the stay of the King.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations for peace between Denmark on the one side, and Austria
                            and Prussia on the other, are slowly proceeding. So far as I am
                            informed, no great progress has been made in settling the question as to
                            the sovereignty of the duchies.</p>
                        <p>It is no secret, I believe, that the Prussian government is not at
                            present favorable to the claims of the Prince of Augustenburg, and there
                            seems an inclination to bring more prominently forward the pretensions
                            of the Duke of Oldenburg.</p>
                        <p>Nothing has been settled either by the Bund or between Austria and
                            Prussia, There is an absence of news of all kinds, and I shall not take
                            up your time by speculations as to the future course of events, which do
                            not concern us very nearly, and the development of which we may,
                            therefore, await with patience.</p>
                        <p>The main question—that of peace or war—has been decided, and Europe at
                            present has a very pacific aspect.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>P. S.—It is, I believe, understood that the administration of
                                Holstein, so long as the question of sovereignty is in abeyance,
                                will be in the hands of four commissioners— one from Hanover, and
                                respectively, (the two powers to whom the “execution” was originally
                                intrusted,) together with one Austrian and one Prussian
                                commissioner. Schleswig and Lauenburg will remain in possession of
                                Austria and Prussia, and be governed by commissioners from those
                                powers.</p>
                            <p>Among the various conjectures as to the future, the most plausible
                                would seem to be that Austria might acquiesce in the annexation of
                                the duchies to Prussia in return for a guarantee—by force of arms,
                                if necessary—by Prussia of the non-German provinces of this empire.
                                Of course, this is merely mentioned as a conjecture.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches, Nos. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, and 95,
                            of dates August 26, (two,) 29; September 19, (two,) 24, 26; October 4,
                            (two,) respectively; and a circular of date September 12.</p>
                        <p>I thank you very earnestly for the full and authentic intelligence they
                            convey as to political and military events, the general character of
                            which is certainly <pb facs="0184" n="160" xml:id="pg_160"/> most
                            encouraging to all who sincerely love their country, and have an abiding
                            faith in the noble destiny of the common wealth of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing especially new to report of European affairs. There has
                            been a lull of considerable duration in the long agitation of the
                            political surface.</p>
                        <p>The peace between the German powers and Denmark has not yet been signed,
                            but it is thought that no obstacle exists to its a signature in the
                            immediate future. The treaty, when concluded, will doubtless be
                            published, and as there is probably nothing in the details of any
                            especial interest to us on the other side of the Atlantic, I have not
                            thought it desirable to call your attention to such portions of them as
                            might become known during the progress of the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>After the scission of the provinces from the Danish monarchy has been
                            consummated, the question of the sovereignty will press very strenuously
                            for its solution, and there will probably be much animated debate before
                            the succession question has been settled by the Diet at Frankfort.</p>
                        <p>I am not in possession of any state secrets, and certainly should never
                            affect in this correspondence to enjoy such an advantage; even supposing
                            it to be an advantage to a representative of the United States
                            government, and supposing that there were really very many profound
                            mysteries in the diplomatic world to be discovered, I have, therefore,
                            always abstained from attempting to cast any horoscope as to European
                            politics, save to give the result of my observations from time to time
                            as to the general question of peace or war in the immediate future,
                            always an important one to us.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the year a war between Denmark and Germany seemed
                            inevitable, as I ventured to state. During its progress it appeared
                            probable, from the menacing language and attitude of other powers, that
                            the local war would expand into a more general one. That fear has since
                            been expelled, and it is even possible that Denmark may now be more
                            tranquil, deprived of provinces which it was unable or forbidden to
                            incorporate, than during that period of struggle against an inexorable
                            conclusion, which has been terminated by the war, and the consequent
                            triumph of the German powers.</p>
                        <p>The “personal union” which at a certain stage of the proceedings might
                            probably have been secured by Denmark, would hardly have been more than
                            a very temporary arrangement. I am not able, therefore, to inform you
                            who is to be the sovereign of the duchies, although I suppose it to be
                            probable that Lauenberg will be annexed to Prussia.</p>
                        <p>As to the future settlement of the “burning questions” of Europe, I
                            pretend to no powers of prophecy. I doubt, too, whether there are many
                            European statesmen who would be willing to hazard predictions with
                            confidence. These is logic in events, but syllogisms can with difficulty
                            be comprehended until they have been fairly propounded by time. Academic
                            dissertations about Prussian ambition, and its possible schemes of
                            annexation and mediatization; the chronic dualism between the great
                            kingdom and the great empire of Germany and their historic rivalry for
                            the hegemony of the great people by which central Europe is mainly
                            occupied; the embodiment of the German state-right principle in the
                            policy pursued by the middle and lesser powers; the remodelling of the
                            map of Europe, and, in general, the possible future of the world in this
                            century or the next, are interesting and important themes for
                            philosophical and historical speculation, but have surely no place in a
                            diplomatic correspondence, especially in that of a transatlantic power.
                            I shall only say, therefore, that, so far as my observation can reach,
                            no political changes seem very imminent, and the immediate future can be
                            expressd by negations.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to be very probable at present that Schleswig-Holstein
                            will be annexed to Prussia, or that the German confederation will be
                            strengthened or weakened, or essentially modified in any way, or that
                            France will extend her frontires, or that the King of Italy will reign
                            at Rome, or that independent <pb facs="0185" n="161" xml:id="pg_161"/>
                            Poland will be reconstructed, or that Venetia will cease to be a part of
                            the Austrian empire—at present that the instinct of the governments, if
                            not of the nation, is for peace, for the husbandry of state resources,
                            and for the development of internal industry.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing to say of the famous French Italian convention of
                            September. Two years hence is a long way into the future. It is not
                            probable that this government would look with satisfaction on the
                            downfall of the Pope’s temporal power, even supposing that such an event
                            were a possible result of the treaty. It is very certain that Austria
                            would abstain from any unprovoked attack upon Italy, or upon any power;
                            and I suppose it to be equally certain that she would resist to the
                            utmost any attempt to deprive her of Venice and the Lombard
                            quadrilateral. I neither comment nor moralize, but give you objectively
                            what seem to me the actual facts.</p>
                        <p>Austria is sincerely desirous of peace with all the world. Her financial
                            condition is not very satisfactory at present, and there is a varying
                            but considerable deficit. The rate of taxation is very high. In Vienna
                            one-third of the rents of real estate goes to the tax gatherer, and
                            there is an income tax of seven per centum. The debt is about three
                            thousand millions of florins, including the fund for disencumbering the
                            soil from feudal charges, (<hi rend="italic">Grimdentlastungs
                                steuer;</hi>) nevertheless, the resources of the empire are very
                            great, and with a long period of peace, and a more thorough development
                            of liberal institutions, there is no reason why the wealth of the empire
                            should not be vastly increased.</p>
                        <p>The statesmen of Austria are well aware that the least profitable it feom
                            national expenditure is war-making. There is a strong party, too, who
                            believe that the old system of exclusive tariffs, and of what is the
                            fashion in many parts of the world to call protection of native
                            industry—that is to say, taxation of the mass of the consumers of a
                            country for the benefit, not of the national treasury, but of a certain
                            class of producers—is an error, and a very expensive one. But the
                            production of beet-root sugar, of native tobacco, of spirits and wines,
                            and many other articles, which could be purchased far more cheaply and
                            of better quality in foreign countries, has been immensely stimulated by
                            protection, and the classes interested are too powerful not to be able
                            to oppose with success any sacrifice of their vested interests.</p>
                        <p>The new Zollverein, which will be formed on the basis of the recent
                            French-Prussian treaty at the expiration of the original one after next
                            year, will include nearly all the states of Germany, excepting the
                            Austrian empire; and the tariff of duties will be considerably lower
                            than those of the present Zollverein, and, of course, than those of this
                            empire. There is much negotiation, I believe, between Austria and
                            Prussia on this subject, and it is supposed some bitterness, as the
                            political as well as commercial advantages ensuing to Prussia through
                            the new customs union are thought to be great.</p>
                        <p>As you are well aware, the direct trade between the United States and
                            Austria has sunk to an almost imperceptible amount. The direct
                            exportation from the United States to Austria, in the year 1862, was
                            $35,615, although, of course, a considerable portion of the exports to
                            Bremen, Hamburg, and the Zollverein, which in the same year amounted in
                            all to nearly thirteen million dollars, was sent to Austria.
                            Nevertheless, it will at some future day seem most astonishing that the
                            traffic, direct and indirect, of seventy millions of people, about
                            equally divided between the republic and the empire, could be kept
                            within such infinitesimal proportions, mainly owing to the prohibitory
                            legislation of both countries. There is a kind of panic in the Vienna
                            bourse, and there has been a rise in the gold agio of a few per cent.—a
                            very trifling matter in comparison with the spasmodic oscillations of
                            our own exchange, but one which, nevertheless, causes uneasiness. The
                            premium on specie is now about 17. The panic is partly ascribed to the
                            large purchases going on in financial centres, like Frankfort, of United
                            States bonds, and a corresponding sale of Austrian <pb facs="0186"
                                n="162" xml:id="pg_162"/> securities. Certainly, to those who
                            believe in the continued existence of the United States in the family of
                            nations, the prices of our stocks are tempting. It is not often that the
                            obligations of a great commonwealth pay an interest of 15 per cent to
                            the purchaser. When one recollects that the nation whose credit stands
                            thus low adds one-third to its population and doubles its capital every
                            ten years, and has never been delinquent to its plighted faith since its
                            government was established, it may be supposed that there are
                            individuals hardy enough to venture upon such a speculation,
                            notwithstanding the enormous falsehoods and calumnies which have been
                            sown broadcast through the world by our enemies.</p>
                        <p>I should say that a considerable change in the public opinion of Europe
                            in regard to our affairs had taken place of late. It begins to be
                            thought possible that the republic of the United States may, after all,
                            prove to be the fact, and the slaveholders’ confederacy the fiction; and
                            the world of late has been somewhat less forward than before with
                            school-boy declamations about the horrors of war and the blessings of
                            peace. Writers or speakers who imagine that the American people, in
                            defending their national existence and their free institutions against
                            the revolt of the slaveholders, were simply inspired by a love of
                            carnage in the abstract, and by a desire to sacrifice themselves, their
                            children, and their worldly goods for the mere amusement of carrying on
                            a terrible war, are perhaps a little less admired than they have been.
                            Those Europeans, on the other hand, who could understand from the first
                            the great purpose, the high resolve, the steady progress, and the
                            unfaltering energy of a great people, when engaged in a work which
                            Providence had imposed upon this generation of Americans, rejoice at the
                            result which now seems to them secured—that negro slavery, and the
                            oligarchy based upon it, are to be numbered with the things of the past.
                            They have seen that no war of which history has preserved a record was
                            ever more definite or more logical in its object, more humane in its
                            details, or more thoroughly justified by reason and the highest
                            considerations of humanity.</p>
                        <p>For the American republic to have accepted the political annihilation
                            threatened by the slaveholders, from a base fear of the perils and
                            sacrifices of war, would have been to proclaim itself unworthy to be the
                            guardian of popular freedom and free institutions in the western
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The Reichsrath has been summoned by his Imperial Royal Majesty to
                            assemble on the 12th of November.</p>

                            Jackson, United States consul at Halifax, in which certain reports are
                            given from Charleston and Halifax newspapers in regard to a supposed
                            scheme for shipping 30,000 or 40,000 Polish soldiers for the rebel
                            armies. I shall not neglect your instructions to use due vigilance
                            towards thwarting the scheme referred to; but I would say that, so far
                            as Austrian Poland is concerned, the state of siege in that country
                            still exists, <pb facs="0187" n="163" xml:id="pg_163"/> and it would be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches, Nos. 100, 101, 102, of dates October 18, 24,
                            and November 1, conveying summaries of military intelligence up to their
                            respective dates.</p>
                        <p>The Reichsrath was formally opened on Monday the 14th of this month, at
                            11 a. m. The members of both houses were assembled, as usual, in the
                            place, to hear the speech from the throne. The hall of ceremonies was
                            surrounded with temporary seats for such spectators as were provided
                            with tickets of entrance. On the right of the throne were the places
                            reserved for the empress and the ladies of the imperial family and
                            household. On the left was the tribune of the diplomatic corps, most of
                            the members of which were present.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor took his seat upon the throne at 11 o’clock, the archdukes of
                            his family being grouped on his right, the cabinet ministers and the
                            great officers of state on his left. The reading of the speech occupied
                            about twenty minutes.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive, by a translated copy of the speech which I append,
                            that the Reichsrath, now assembled, is designated as the collective
                            representation of the empire. The election of members for Transylvania,
                            which took place before the conclusion of the last session, is
                            considered sufficient to give the assembly this general character,
                            which, as long as no deputies had been sent from beyond the Leitha, was
                            not supposed to exist.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that a hope is expressed that “constitutional activity
                            will soon reappear in the eastern half of the empire.” Whether Hungary
                            and Croatia, to which allusion is here made, will soon follow the good
                            example of Transylvania, must still be deemed very doubtful. Nothing is
                            said, and I should think very little hoped at present as to Venetia’s
                            being brought into actual constitutional connexion with the empire. The
                            empire of Austria, like the old empire of Germany, of which it is the
                            residuary legatee, is forced to struggle, in this commencement of its
                            constitutional existence, with the centrifugal tendency which has always
                            been the leading characteristic of German political organization. Of
                            more than three hundred deputies composing the imperial parliament,
                            about one hundred and fifty thus far have been elected, Hungary, which
                            has been a kingdom with a comparatively liberal although feudal
                            parliament during the long period of German absolutism, seems still in
                            disposed to merge its independent existence in that imperial unity which
                            forms the leading object of Austrian statesmen in the new period of
                            constitutionalism, There has been thus far, however, sufficient central
                            force to compel the political cohesion of the various portions of the
                            empire, even although the voluntary constitutional assimilation is still
                            wanting. The statesmen of Austria are well aware that without this
                            compulsory cohesion the empire would cease to exist. If torn by internal
                            dissensions, it would necessarily become the prey of jealous neighbors
                            and rivals. In this connexion I would call your attention to a
                            remarkable <pb facs="0188" n="164" xml:id="pg_164"/> address just
                            delivered to the house of deputies by their president or speaker. This
                            officer is not elected by the chamber, but is appointed by the crown.
                            The address partakes more of the nature of a historical and
                            philosophical lecture than of a parliamentary speech; and the orator is,
                            of course, only expressing his own opinions, not making a political
                            manifesto. There is much depth of thought and vigor of illustration in
                            the harangue, and it possesses great interest both for the light thus
                            shed by a philosophic mind upon Austrian and upon German affairs, and by
                            the reflection indirectly and unintentionally thrown upon many points in
                            our own history and polity.</p>
                        <p>“The elements out of which the Austrian monarchy has compounded itself”
                            says President von Hasner, “were, in the stage of their development,
                            broken up into states. * * * The parts, had history allowed it, could
                            have remained independent, and have really become states. As, however,
                            they combined themselves into a higher legal unity, they could not
                            deprive that unity of the right to develop itself into that form of
                            universality which is the state, for the state must be somewhere. * * *
                            * Now there are certainly various forms of state powers, but that
                            particular form according to which the shattered power of the unity
                            belongs to the various parts, is the negation of the state—it is
                            impossible. One will not venture, I hope, to call this a mere
                            theoretical dispute. It is the skeleton upon which the flesh of all
                            political discussion must form itself. In it is made manifest the
                            totality of our situation, for the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> state
                            never understood how to make the political signification of the modern
                            United States dear and valuable to the parts united in it. While,
                            however, it did not understand how to awaken their interest, it at the
                            same time left with them a dim consciousness of their own rights. Thus
                            only is it conceivable that even on this day of reawakened liberty, the
                            parts thus united could not hail it as the réalization of their wishes;
                            but, on the contrary, withdrew themselves, shyly, into the warm corner
                            of their so-called well-won rights. This was the ground upon which the
                            Austrian constitution arose.”</p>
                        <p>The position of Hungary and other kingdoms and provinces, in their
                            attitude of passive resistance to the constitution of 1861, could not be
                            more adroitly or philosophically indicated. How soon those “shy” members
                            of the United Empire will be drawn out of the “warm corners” of their
                            ancient feudal privileges remains to be seen. To attract them into the
                            imperial constitutional union is now the great object of the government.
                            So far as I am informed, however, they are likely for the present to
                            maintain their coyness.</p>
                        <p>But if Austria, which is after all a great imperial, powerful organism,
                            an essential element of the European pentarchy, is forced to struggle so
                            strenuously against the elements of dissolution thus indicated by one of
                            her leading constitutional statesmen, how much more potent is the
                            centrifugal tendency of the various component parts of Germany, whose
                            fictitious unity is represented by the Bund. Those Americans must be
                            blind to all the teachings of history who can fail to find pregnant
                            lessons for ourselves in the perpetual efforts of Germany towards that
                            unity of which the course of its history has deprived the German people.
                            The historical result, solemnly established and recorded more than two
                            hundred years ago by the congress of Westphalia, was the disunion of
                            Germany, and the recognition of the sovereignty of its many states. The
                            historical result established by the constitutional convention of 1787
                            in our country was the unity of America, and the virtual abdication of
                            sovereignty by the States. Our state for eighty years has been the
                            United Republic. The state in Germany has been, for centuries,
                            Wurtemberg or Hanover, Prussia or Austria, Leppe-Detmold or Walderk, or
                            however the greater or minuter atoms of nationality may be designated;
                            yet, strange to say, while it is the constant effort of the most liberal
                            and the most patriotic minds in Germany to bring about that national
                            unity which has never been, but of which the Bund at least expresses the
                            perpetual hope, it is the desire of various parties in America to <pb
                                facs="0189" n="165" xml:id="pg_165"/> reduce our magnificent Union
                            to the helpless condition of a confederacy, from which the wisdom of our
                            ancestors so fortunately rescued us. I shall not pursue this train of
                            analogy, but I cannot resist adding a further paragraph or two from the
                            address of the Austrian “President” in regard to the German
                            question.</p>
                        <p>“Here, too,” says Mr. von Hasner, “it seems to me our position is clearly
                            limited on the one part by our legal obligations, while on the other
                            side a correct appreciation of history will guard us against
                            contradictions and precipitate action. The centrifugal movement of the
                            history of the German empire has formed the twigs of the German oak into
                            trunks. To unite them again to the original stem is the impulse (<hi
                                rend="italic">drang</hi>) of the German people. In a history
                            centuries old, the real form of the German empire has grown ever paler
                            and paler, through the development of provincial sovereignty, until, in
                            the peace of Westphalia, the parts became states, and the empire was
                            converted into what Puffendorf has described as a political monstrosity.
                            The German question is the demand for nullification against this last
                            lawsuit of world-history. Whether the suit is still to be gained,
                            whether the parts now developed into states—yes, and great states—will
                            ever assent to any essential curtailment of their sovereignty, on this I
                            will disturb no man’s faith. But the history of German political life,
                            and the experience of later times, make it clear to me that a real unity
                            will not spin itself like silk out of the chrysalis of the Frankfort
                            Diet, and that it will never be possible by free consent to establish a
                            general form of government whose appearance would not rather injure than
                            content the German people. The strong hand, however, which could do this
                            by force I do not see.</p>
                        <p>“That which Charlemagne, a thousand years ago, could not permanently
                            effect, that I think will hardly be attempted by the Epigoni. Germany’s
                            Chæronea and Philippi are not to be feared from Prussia. Austria’s
                            centre of gravity is by far not in Ofen, but Germany’s centre of gravity
                            is by far not in Berlin.”</p>
                        <p>On the 18th of November the finance minister, M. von Plener, made his
                            annual report, bringing in the budget for 1865. It is understood that
                            the budget for 1866 will also be presented so soon as the discussion
                            upon that for the next coming year shall have been terminated.</p>
                        <p>Although the nominal deficit is less for 1865 than it was for any one of
                            the three preceding years—to go no further back—yet the effect produced
                            by the financial statement does not seem very cheerful. The sum total of
                            estimated expenses for 1865 (ordinary and extraordinary) is stated by
                            the minister at 548,705,412 florins; the sum total of receipts as
                            518,227,816 florins. There is therefore a deficit of 30,477,596 florins
                            to be covered.</p>
                        <p>The. Austrian share of the cost for the campaign in Schleswig-Holstein is
                            fixed by article XII of the treaty just concluded with Denmark at the
                            round sum of eighteen millions, to be repaid by the duchies. If this is
                            collected during the coming year the deficit would be reduced in round
                            numbers to twelve millions.</p>
                        <p>The critics of the statement, however, maintain that two items of the
                            estimated receipts, viz., about sixteen millions to be derived from the
                            sale of certain state domains and mines, and ten millions of pounds from
                            a former loan contracted in England, but not yet paid in, are not
                            reasonably to be charged as income. If added to the balance left, after
                            deducting the claim on the duchies, the result would be a deficit of 12
                            + 16 + 10=38 millions of florins. On the other hand sixty millions of
                            debt maturing the coming year are to be paid off. Whether this is to be
                            a real reduction of the debt, or a mere substitution of one form of
                            indebtedness for another, it is not at present in my power to state. A
                            favorable feature of the exhibit is that instead of the deficit for
                            1862, formerly estimated by the minister at nearly ninety-eight
                            millions, a real deficiency of, in round numbers, only seventy-five
                            millions has subsequently manifested itself, <pb facs="0190" n="166"
                                xml:id="pg_166"/> the difference being caused by a larger yield from
                            the taxes (especially in Hungary) than bad been anticipated. Thus the
                            deficit during the last four years, from 1862 to 1865, inclusive, would
                            be 75 + 62+109 + 30=276 millions of florins, or an annual average of
                            about seventy millions of florins.</p>

                            into operation. I also expect that in the eastern portion of my empire
                            the same constitutional activity which has so happily prevailed in my
                            principality of Siebenburgen will everywhere begin afresh. To this
                            object, which I desire shortly to see achieved, not only in the interest
                            of those kingdoms, but also of my whole empire, the chief endeavors of
                            my government are directed. Confidence and real unanimity will conduce
                            to blessed results. A series of events important not only to my family,
                            but also to the whole empire, have occurred between the close of the
                            last session and the present day. The acceptance of the Mexican imperial
                            throne, with my consent, on the part of my brother, the Archduke
                            Ferdinand Maximilian, now Emperor Maximilian I, of Mexico, has rendered
                            necessary a settlement of the rights of the agnates thereby brought
                            under consideration. For this purpose I executed a family compact at
                            Miramar, on the 9th of April in the present year, which my government is
                            authorized to communicate to you.</p>
                        <p>Animated by the earnest endeavor to assist in the preservation and
                            maintenance of general peace, I congratulate myself upon the good
                            understanding and friendly relations existing between my government and
                            the other great powers of Europe. I shall not cease to uphold these
                            relations, and to do everything in order to preserve my empire, at
                            present occupied with so many important tasks, from foreign
                            complications.</p>
                        <p>A subject of dispute for many years in the north of Germany has just been
                            settled in the most honorable manner. The representatives of my empire
                            will participate with truly patriotic feeling in my satisfaction that a
                            close which contains the fulfilment of the highest expectations has been
                            put to the war between the German powers and Denmark by the treaty of
                            peace signed at Vienna on the 30th October, and the ratification of
                            which is expected in a few days. The courage of the allied troops and
                            the navies of Austria and Prussia has conquered that splendid prize, and
                            the wise and just reticence of the neutral powers has facilitated the
                            final understanding. The high value of the unanimity between myself and
                            my august federal ally, the king of Prussia, has again been proved by
                            memorable results. But I do not doubt that in face of the glorious and
                            happy solution of the question by which Germany has been excited to her
                            inmost core, the entire country will again find that concord which
                            affords so powerful a guarantee for her own safety and welfare, as well
                            as for the quiet and equilibrium of Europe. To my regret, the
                            unfortunate influence which events in <pb facs="0191" n="167"
                                xml:id="pg_167"/> the kingdom of Poland have recently exercised upon
                            the countries bordering my empire, have imposed upon my government the
                            necessity of undertaking exceptional measures in those countries for the
                            preservation of internal quiet, and for the protection of the person and
                            property of the peaceable population. They have been accompanied with
                            successful results for the security of these imperilled interests. I
                            have perceived with satisfaction that a portion of these measures have
                            already shown themselves capable of being dispensed with, and I gladly
                            give myself up to the expectation that they may be entirely withdrawn at
                            no distant period.</p>
                        <p>The finances of my kingdom will claim your special attention. It was not
                            possible that the unfavorable conditions which everywhere govern the
                            European money market could be without obstructive influences on the
                            progress of the politico-economical and financial development of
                            Austria. In this unmistakably difficult situation the payment of the
                            increased demands of the state has yet constantly been punctually
                            provided for. The earnest striving to economize affords satisfactory
                            expectation that when the extraordinary state expenses still at present
                            existing have been surmounted, the disturbances in the f6inances and in
                            the equilibrium of the budget will at last be removed. Two budgets will
                            exceptionally be laid before you in the present session, viz., that for
                            the year 1865, and immediately afterwards that for the year 1866. By
                            this transitory measure it is intended to introduce a settled succession
                            of time in the sessions of the Reichsrath and the provincial diets, and
                            also insure the possibility of concluding the labors of the budget prior
                            to the commencement of the financial year.</p>
                        <p>The first financial law, constitutionally passed, has been included in
                            the general budget for 1865; the last will be laid before you in this
                            session by my government. I recommend to your especial attention the
                            bills to be brought in for the regulation of the direct taxation, the
                            speedy operation of which is to be desired as much in the interest of a
                            more just and equitable partition of the burden of taxation as of a
                            provision better corresponding to the demands of the state.</p>
                        <p>Your attention will also be directed to the consideration of other
                            financial measures, with the object of improving existing laws, and the
                            partial, not unimportant, alleviation of the burdens of the
                            tax-payers.</p>
                        <p>I mention in this category a bill to lessen the poll tax in my
                            principality of Siebenburgen.</p>
                        <p>For several years past the politico-economical unity of Germany, which is
                            designated in the 19th article of the federal act as the object of the
                            efforts of the federation, has taken more decided shape in later
                            treaties, and one more in conformity with the requirements of the time.
                            This question has engaged the full attention of my government.</p>
                        <p>To bring about a successful solution of this problem, which is of
                            importance to the federal Diet, and greatly concerns the interests of
                            Austria, negotiations have become necessary, which are now being
                            conducted by my government with that earnestness befitting the subject.
                            The result of these negotiations will be communicated to you by my
                            government, and I hope that they will not be without favorable influence
                            upon the establishment of the new customs tariff which is to come into
                            operation in the course of this session.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the advantages which will accrue to my empire in every
                            respect by the increase of means of communication, I have commissioned
                            my government at once to direct their uninterrupted and energetic labors
                            to the preparation of a plan for the formation of a network of railways
                            sufficient for the wants of my kingdom and principalities. Conformably
                            to these views, my government will bring before you a series of bills in
                            reference to the state guarantee to several new railway undertakings. At
                            any rate, in the course of this session, and as soon as possible, a bill
                            will be submitted for constitutional consideration, having for its
                            object the formation of a line to the principality of Transylvania, and
                            through the interior of that country.</p>
                        <p>With deep regret I have perceived the heavy pressure to which trade in my
                            territories, as well as elsewhere, has been exposed; yet the advanced
                            position it has already taken up induces me to hope that, sheltered by
                            the blessings of peace, its own power, and sound legislation, it will
                            again attain a lasting and satisfactory development. Several bills
                            having reference to politico-economical interests, as well as other
                            matters coming within the province of the assembled Reichsrath, are
                            being prepared by my government to be laid before you, and will be
                            brought in fur discussion in the course of the session. It is my wish,
                            for the fulfilment of which your devoted zeal is a guarantee, to see the
                            questions to which you are about to turn your attention speedily
                            settled, since a series of important and voluminous bills has been
                            prepared by my government for the consideration of the lesser
                            Reichsrath, whose return depends upon that condition.</p>
                        <p>Honored members of my Reichsrath: While I dismiss you with the assurance
                            of my imperial favor and grace to the consideration of the important
                            questions before you, I am not unaware of their difficulties; but I have
                            firm confidence that, with your counsel and assistance, I shall succeed
                            in conducting the empire intrusted to me by Providence with a strong
                            hand towards a fortunate future. I derive this confidence from the love
                            and fidelity, from the sagacity and strength of my subjects, whom I
                            recommend to the almighty protection of Heaven, wishing from my inmost
                            heart that their destinies may conduce to the happiness and fame of
                            their common fatherland.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It becomes my painful duty to report the
                            total destruction by fire of the church of the Compaña, of this city, on
                            the 8th instant, involving a loss of nearly two thousand five hundred
                            lives.</p>
                        <p>It has been customary for some years past to celebrate the “month of May”
                            with great pomp. Upon the 8th of December, the anniversary of the
                            “immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary,” the festivities always close
                            with a grand illumination of the church, and appropriate ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday evening, the 8th instant, crowds flocked from every quarter of
                            the city to the church, and by 7 o’clock every portion of the immense
                            edifice was filled with a densely packed crowd, nearly all females, and
                            the steps of the building and the street in front were also
                            thronged.</p>
                        <p>The number of lights with which the church was illuminated is variously
                            estimated at from ten to twenty thousand, the greater portion of them
                            being paraffine lamps and chandeliers, many of which were suspended from
                            the ceiling by cords.</p>
                        <p>As the last of the lamps upon the great altar was being lighted, a jet of
                            flame was seen to proceed from an illuminated crescent, at the foot of a
                            colossal statue of the Virgin. The assistant threw his poncho over the
                            flame, with the hope of extinguishing it, but the highly inflammable
                            liquid defied his efforts, and soon reaching the garlands of flowers
                            profusely adorning the altar, shot upward towards the already overheated
                            wood-work of the ceiling. In a few moments the lofty dome was wrapped in
                            flames, the lamps and chandeliers being detached by hundreds, as the
                            cords were burned, and, as they fell, scattered their burning contents
                            upon the compact mass of people below.</p>
                        <p>It is well ascertained that at this moment but one of the main doors and
                            two small side doors were open.</p>
                        <p>The terrified crowd, composed almost exclusively of females, as before
                            stated, rushed frantically towards the doors. There being no pews or
                            seats in the churches in this country, the congregation kneel in close
                            proximity, so that rapid exit in case of alarm is difficult, if not
                            impossible. Each one is kneeling upon the dress of her immediate
                            neighbor, and innumerable skirts and crinolines are so involved as to
                            prevent the possibility of quick and systematic movement. Very few
                            succeeded in escaping, and these few bruised, scorched, and naked. The
                            throngs which had succeeded in reaching the very thresholds of the doors
                            became compact, immovable masses of human beings, and the flames,
                            leaping with amazing rapidity along the arches and ceiling, darted down
                            and enveloped them in a sea of fire.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the alarm was given I hastened to the spot, which is but two
                            squares distant from this legation. The scene presented was horrible
                            beyond description or conception. Within the scope of my vision were
                            more than a thousand persons, manifesting by shrieks, groans, and
                            actions, every conceivable form of human agony. Some were writhing in
                            the embrace of the flames, stretching out their eager hands for that
                            help which it was impossible to give, some standing with uplifted arms,
                            some prostrate and insensible, some kneeling, with clasped hands,
                            evidently commending themselves to Him into whose presence they would
                            soon be precipitated.</p>
                        <pb facs="0193" n="169" xml:id="pg_169"/>
                        <p>Aided by Dr. Silvey, United States vice-consul for Valparaiso, and by
                            others, chiefly Americans, we succeeded in dragging some of the victims
                            from the doorways, and continued our efforts until the increasing flames
                            and prostrate bodies showed that all hope of further assistance was
                            gone. Among those prominent in rescuing the sufferers were Henry Meiggs,
                            of California, Henry M. Keith, of New York, George Colton, of Rhode
                            Island, A. Andrews, of California, C. T. Pearce, of Rhode Island, and W.
                            Eaton, of New York.</p>
                        <p>At a little after 8 o’clock the last tower, containing a chime of bells,
                            fell with a tremendous crash, and it became no longer possible to give
                            the least aid to the burning victims.</p>
                        <p>There are but three fire-engines in the city, and they are small,
                            inefficient, and badly served. They arrived at the scene some half hour
                            after the beginning of the fire; but were so utterly worthless as to
                            afford no assistance whatever. The flames subsided about midnight, from
                            mere want of material on which to feed.</p>
                        <p>I visited the interior of the church the next morning, and nothing can
                            exceed in horror the spectacle there presented. The whole pavement of
                            the building was strewn with the swollen and disfigured corpses of the
                            victims, while near the door were heaps of charred objects, only
                            distinguishable by the shape as having been once human beings. They were
                            rapidly removed to the cemetery, where one general grave was dug for
                            their reception.</p>
                        <p>The official statistics have not yet been published; but from the
                            secretary of the church, and the records of the hospitals, I gather that
                            more than two thousand persons perished within the walls of the church,
                            and that several hundred more died after removal.</p>
                        <p>The entire city is shrouded in gloom. The best, and some of the
                            aristocratic families in the city, are the greatest sufferers. Many of
                            the most elegant and accomplished ladies of the city perished. Youth and
                            beauty, and old age, were overwhelmed in one common ruin. In several
                            instances whole families were swept away, and their unoccupied houses
                            are in the custody of the civil authorities.</p>
                        <p>Upon the 11th instant I addressed a note to his excellency the secretary
                            of foreign relations, expressing on behalf of my fellow-citizens, and on
                            my own, our profound sympathy in the distressing calamity which has
                            overwhelmed the community, (see enclosure A,) to which his excellency
                            replied, upon the 12th, informing me that he had been expressly charged
                            by the president to signify to me the profound gratitude of the people
                            and government of Chili for the exertions of the American residents upon
                            the night of the catastrophe, and for their sympathy in the general
                            mourning. (See enclosure B and translation C.)</p>
                        <p>These notes have been published in the papers of this city and Valparaiso
                            by the government. The editorial articles in the Mercurio of the 14th,
                            and in the Voz de Chili of the 15th, introducing the official
                            correspondence, breathe so warm a spirit of kindness toward Americans
                            that I deem it proper to enclose herein (marked D and E) copies and
                            translations thereof.</p>
                        <p>Upon the 14th instant the president issued a decree ordering the
                            demolition of the walls of the ruined church, and in spite of an
                            opposition from the clergy, which at one time threatened to become
                            serious and even bloody, the work is being quietly executed.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            which your excellency was pleased to address to me yesterday, to signify
                            to me the profound regret caused in the mind of your excellency, and in
                            that of your fellow-citizens residing in Chili, for the terrible
                            misfortune occurring in this city on Tuesday, the 8th instant, which has
                            carried grief into the minds of many families, and has covered the
                            entire community with mourning. Your excellency likewise informs me that
                            the government and people represented by your excellency will feel the
                            deepest sorrow upon receiving the news of this catastrophe; and your
                            excellency concludes, expressing to me your trust that the Lord may
                            grant consolation to the afflicted and unprotected, and cause us all, in
                            view of the uncertainty of life, to be ever prepared to obey the decrees
                            of Providence.</p>
                        <p>My government has learned the foregoing with lively gratitude, and has
                            discovered in your excellency’s communication an alleviation to the

                            as a new evidence of the fraternal sentiments which animate your
                            excellency and your worthy fellow-citizens in favor of our republic. The
                            generous and active efforts which your excellency and they displayed on
                            Tuesday to save the interesting victims from the frightful fire had
                            already won the gratitude of my government, which has been revived by
                            the present manifestation.</p>

                            the honorable representative and the citizens of the United States who
                            have taken part in our public mourning that the noble conduct observed
                            by them upon this sad occasion will be ever gratefully remembered by the
                            Chilian people and government.</p>

                        <p>Not in vain do nations become reconciled and love one another. Not in
                            vain do peoples give generous hospitality to people of good heart and
                            elevated soul. There are solemn occasions in which the hand of God makes
                            evident these noble bonds of fraternity, and one of these occasions have
                            we witnessed, upon the scorching steps of the Compaña, arrive for our
                            brothers the citizens of the free and magnanimous Union of the north on
                            the horrible night of the 8th of December, 1863.</p>
                        <p>But a few years since the name of <hi rend="italic">North American</hi>
                            was for us only a source of suspicion, of antipathy, or threat. But when
                            the question of <hi rend="italic">filibusterism,</hi> which had its den
                            among the slaveocracy of the south, and which met only opprobrium and
                            reprobation in the free States of the north, was made clear, the
                            reaction of justice began to be felt in our people. And when we saw this
                            entire nation of the north rise as one man for the purpose of putting
                            down the audacity of the defenders of William Walker and of the
                            sacrificers of John Brown, that reaction was converted into sincere
                            sympathy, which has been strengthened by the victories as well as by the
                            reverses of the Union.</p>
                        <p>This conduct of ours has met the most cordial reciprocity on the part of
                            the North Americans resident among us. Their representative, the worthy,
                            courteous, and popular Thomas H. Nelson, has been the first to place
                            himself in the midst of the Chilian people, participating in all their
                            national festivities and public demonstrations, making us hear his
                            eloquence not only in the official despatches addressed by him to this
                            government, but in all the discourses delivered by him at our popular
                            banquets. The conduct of Mr. Meiggs, especially towards the working and
                            needy classes, is too well known to require us to refer to it here as an
                            eulogium, as is that which, following his example, has been manifested
                            by his subordinates. Let us only recall that to the enthusiasm of one of
                            them is due the erection of the expiatory monument to Manuel Rodrigues
                            in the valley of Til-til, and the sumptuous popular feast with which it
                            was inaugurated.</p>
                        <p>But the cordiality of the Americans and Chilians was not only to manifest
                            itself in draining joyous libations at the festive board. The hour of
                            the catastrophe arrived and they were among the earliest to hasten to
                            offer the generous aid of their strength and unselfishness.</p>
                        <p>Among the first to arrive at the doors of the Compaña, already a prey to
                            the flames were Mr. Nelson himself and the consul of the United States
                            at Valparaiso, Mr. Silvey, who, residing in the immediate vicinity of
                            the church, worked in person from the beginning, exposing their own
                            lives in order to save some victims. The same was done by Messrs.
                            Meiggs, Keith, and some ex-employés of the Valparaiso railroad, who at
                            that hour were met together in the house of the former, two-thirds of a
                            mile from the scene of the catastrophe. We ourselves met Messrs. Meiggs
                            and Keith on that terrible night, with grief upon their countenances,
                            their clothing torn and soaked with water, and with voices so hoarse
                            they could hardly speak; and having asked the former if he thought any
                            had perished within the church, he replied, in a voice which froze our
                            blood, <hi rend="italic">thousands.</hi> Alas! he was one of the few,
                            the only one perhaps, who had not been mistaken in that hour of terrible
                            confusion. We are assured that Mr. Meiggs caused himself to be wet
                            through on purpose, so as to enter into the midst of the flames. This is
                            not humanity only, it is heroism.</p>
                        <p>We are happy that these sentiments are not the expressions of individual
                            appreciation alone. The two public documents which we publish below, and
                            which the minister of the (foreign) department has authorized us to give
                            to the <pb facs="0196" n="172" xml:id="pg_172"/> press, place in high
                            relief all that we have said upon the confraternity of the two
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>May these eloquent documents and these weak lines bear to the citizens of
                            the Union, not only in Chili, but in the entire universe, the expression
                            of the profound gratitude due them for their noble conduct from the
                            Chilenos.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Nelson, sympathizing in the grief which weighs down our community in
                            consequence of the catastrophe of the 8th, has addressed the following
                            note to our government:</p>
                        <p>(Here follows Mr. Nelson’s note of the 11th instant to Mr. Tocornal.)</p>
                        <p>We have read with profound sympathy and a lively sentiment of gratitude
                            the above note, and we warmly grasp that generous hand which our
                            brothers stretch out to us in our misfortune. They fraternize with us in
                            the moments of our grief, proving to us that grief knows no nationality.
                            Bound to the sons of the great republic of the north by the instincts of
                            liberty, by the grandeur of the traditions of America, by the noble
                            examples she has given us in her political life, by our common hopes for
                            the future, by glory and danger, by the ties of humanity, they now come
                            forward, in the person of their worthy representative, to place a solemn
                            seal upon the union of ideas and sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nelson, who has known how to conquer the sympathies of our society,
                            by the frankness and chivalry of his character, comes now to augment and
                            give deep root to those sympathies, sealing them with the inspiring of
                            sincere gratitude. His note is not one of those diplomatic compliments,
                            one of those official documents, cold as a reason of state, and
                            calculated as an interest; it is not the obligatory condolence of a mere
                            relation. It is the true cry of a feeling heart; of a soul profoundly
                            moved by a brother’s grief; it is the embrace of an entire people to
                            another people in distress, confounding itself with that people to
                            console it; bringing in all sincerity, under the mantle of fraternity,
                            the noble sentiments which give resignation. These are his feeling
                            words, words which can only issue from a wounded spirit, which sustains
                            its life in hope and faith, looking towards “<hi rend="italic">Him who
                                tempers the wind to the shorn lamb”</hi> and bowing in conscious
                            resignation before the mysterious designs of Providence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nelson first offered the aid of his arm to the victims; exposing,
                            repeatedly, his life to save that of others perishing in that fiery
                            furnace. He and many of his compatriots, with the most heroic
                            forgetfulness of self, were there at the post of danger, braving it
                            nobly; lending their powerful aid to the unfortunate who implored
                            salvation. He did his duty, and did it like a man.</p>
                        <p>He now takes the voice of a people, of an immense and generous people,
                            and brings to us the aid of that sweet consolation which so greatly
                            relieves the suffering heart. We accept the manifestation of these
                            sentiments, assuring Mr. Nelson that his words have fallen as a gentle
                            balm into the wounds yet open in the vitals of our society, and that
                            from every lip come forth sincere words, adorning his name with a crown
                            of gratitude.</p>
                        <p>Our government has also received these words with profound gratitude; and
                            in the name of the people it represents, has replied to Mr. Nelson in
                            the following note:</p>
                        <p>(Here follows Mr. Tocornal’s note of the 12th instant, in reply to that
                            of Mr. Nelson of the 11th.)</p>
                        <pb facs="0197" n="173" xml:id="pg_173"/>
                        <p>These are the words of speaking conviction; this is an embrace of
                            humanity; two sister nations embracing in the hour of misfortune, which
                            is also the hour of duty; who, together, elevate their prayers and
                            lamentations to mingle in one sole idea, and aspire to the union of
                            souls before the Divine presence.</p>
                        <p>If we have found words of grief, and sympathy to mourn over the
                            misfortunes of that disastrous war which is tearing the vitals of the
                            great republic, her sons turn away from that beloved horizon, and
                            towards us, opening in their hearts a new asylum for the grief of their
                            brethren.</p>
                        <p>Let Mr. Nelson receive for himself and his fellow-countrymen, in the name
                            of our people, the assurances of our most sincere gratitude.</p>

                            of the fearful destruction of the Church of the Compaña at Santiago, on
                            the 8th instant.</p>
                        <p>You were right in hastening, without awaiting for instructions, to tender
                            to the President of the republic the condolence and the sympathies of
                            the American people on the occasion of that afflicting visitation of
                            Divine Providence. The sentiments you expressed in that communication

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In my despatch No. 99, of July 17, 1863, I
                            had the honor to inform you of the conditional declaration of war made
                            by Bolivia against Chili, founded. upon the alleged wrongful
                            appropriation by the latter of some three degrees of latitude belonging
                            to the former republic.</p>
                        <p>In view of the evident determination of both republics to adhere to their
                            claims to the disputed territory, and of the apparent impossibility of
                            deciding by negotiation the questions involved, and in view of the
                            interest held by our government in the settlement of the “Alsop &amp;
                            Co.” and “Sportsman” claims, both dependent, principally, upon the
                            decision of the questions involved in the discussion between the
                            aforesaid republics, I ventured to suggest in my despatch No. 102, of
                            August 1, 1863, that I be instructed to propose the reference of all the
                            points in dispute to the arbitration of some friendly power.</p>
                        <p>In your despatch No. 48, of September 16, 1863, acknowledging the receipt
                            of my last named communication, you stated “that it would be preferable
                            for <pb facs="0198" n="174" xml:id="pg_174"/> those republics to refer
                            their respective territorial pretensions to the arbitrament of a third
                            power.”</p>
                        <p>At the date of the receipt of this despatch, Doctor Thomas Frias, the
                            minister plenipotentiary of Bolivia, had arrived in Santiago charged
                            with the special mission of endeavoring to settle the question of
                            territorial jurisdiction pending between that republic and Chili.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Frias had been especially charged by his government to consult
                            with me upon the objects of his mission; and, after a number of
                            conferences, I deemed it most decorous to defer the presentation of my
                            proposition of arbitration until he had had an opportunity of presenting
                            the views of his government, and of arranging, if possible, the question
                            of limits, without the interference of a third party, intending to
                            reserve my appeal until a time when every other resource had been
                            exhausted, and when its effect would, perhaps, be more salutary.</p>
                        <p>A very voluminous correspondence ensued between the minister of Bolivia
                            and the secretary of foreign relations. The latter insisted upon the
                            withdrawal of the conditional declaration of war issued at Oruro June 5,
                            1863, by the Congress of Bolivia, and upon indemnity being granted to
                            Don Matias Torres, a Chilian citizen, alleged to have been imprisoned
                            and otherwise ill-treated by the Bolivian authorities, for exporting
                            guano from the disputed territory, under license from the Chilian
                            authorities. Mr. Frias, on the other hand, asked the sequestration of
                            the disputed territory until the question should be definitely
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>These demands were regarded by the respective ministers as conditions
                            precedent to the discussion of the main question; but Mr. Frias finally
                            desisted from his demand of sequestration, and simply asked that orders
                            be given to prohibit further exportation of guano from the disputed
                            territory pending the question of jurisdiction, but declined, at the
                            same time, to accede to the demands of Chili, alleging that the
                            conditional declaration of war by Bolivia was purely a domestic act, and
                            that the criminal prosecution against Torres had been already
                            suspended.</p>
                        <p>M. Tocornal having peremptorily declined to order such prohibition, M.
                            Frias, upon the 24th ultimo, requested his passports, and upon the 2d
                            instant sailed for Bolivia, diplomatic relations being thus entirely
                            suspended between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Upon the 25th ultimo, upon being apprised of these facts, I addressed a
                            note (see enclosure A) to the secretary of foreign relations,
                            deprecating the cessation of friendly relations between the two
                            republics, and earnestly advising a reference of <hi rend="italic"
                                >all</hi> the questions in dispute to arbitration.</p>
                        <p>To add force to my suggestion, the concluding paragraphs of my note were
                            in language almost identical with that of M. Tocornal’s own note of
                            December 30, 1863, addressed to the cabinets of Quito and Bogota,
                            imploring those republics to refrain from fratricidal strife, and giving
                            up, each one, some portion of its pretensions, to submit the questions
                            involved to the arbitration of some friendly power.</p>
                        <p>Upon the 7th instant the secretary of foreign relations addressed me, in
                            reply, a communication, a copy and translation of which form enclosures
                            B and C, wherein, after expressing the gratitude of his government for
                            the friendly interest taken in the affair by my government and by this
                            legation, he stated that the question of boundary had never been reached
                            in the discussion between himself and the representative of Bolivia;
                            that the honor and dignity of Chili demanded that, before entering upon
                            the discussion of the main question, Bolivia should withdraw the threat
                            implied in the conditional declaration of war, and should indemnify
                            Torres; that the minister of Bolivia had distinctly refused compliance
                            with the demands of Chili; that, while Chili was loyally anxious to
                            enter upon the discussion of the main question, this refusal of Bolivia
                            rendered it impossible; that Peru had tendered its good offices and
                            friendly mediation for the settlement <pb facs="0199" n="175"
                                xml:id="pg_175"/> of the boundary question, and that the government
                            of Chili had hastened to inform it that, under these circumstances, it
                            was with great regret obliged to decline availing itself at present of
                            so generous an offer; that from that time to the present the state of
                            affairs having undergone no change whatever favorable to mediation, he
                            found himself compelled to give to this legation the same reply as that
                            given to Peru.</p>
                        <p>Expressing a determination to avoid as far as possible the painful
                            consequences which might result from this rupture, and a hope that
                            Bolivia may yet return upon her steps and offer to Chili the reparation
                            she demands as a condition precedent to all discussion, his excellency
                            concluded by stating that in such an event it would be very grateful to
                            Chili to recur, if necessary, to the friendly offices of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that while my suggestion of arbitration embraced all
                            the points in dispute between the two republics, the secretary of
                            foreign relations, in his reply, has deemed proper to consider the
                            boundary question as alone referred to.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that Chili will avoid a reference to arbitration of the
                            questions in dispute, and that she will maintain her claim to
                            jurisdiction over the desert of Atacama, especially since Bolivia is not
                            in a position to recur to other arguments than those of diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>M. Tocornal having expressed a desire to publish the notes exchanged
                            between this legation and the department of foreign relations upon the
                            Chili-Bolivian question, I gave my consent thereto, and, upon the 19th
                            instant, the correspondence appeared in the “Arancano,” the official
                            organ of the government. It was very generally copied into the
                            newspapers of the country, and commented upon by them in a spirit of
                            cordial good feeling towards the United States. (See enclosure D.)</p>
                        <p>While the instructions given me upon this subject were of a character
                            more general than specific, I have thought it my duty to do all in my
                            power to avert the disastrous consequences of a war between two sister
                            republics of America, deeming it important not only to cultivate the
                            most friendly relations between our own country and that to which I have
                            the honor to be accredited, but also to interpose the good offices of
                            our government to prevent the severance of those friendly bonds between
                            the country of my residence and neighboring republics. I trust that my
                            action in the premises may be approved.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have perused with the deepest interest
                            the various arguments presented by the republics of Chili and Bolivia in
                            behalf of their respective claims to juris diction over the desert of
                            Atacama, and have most carefully studied the antecedents of the
                            discussion so far as published.</p>
                        <p>It has appeared to me while Chili upon the one hand, maintains
                            unhesitatingly her right of dominion over the territory in dispute, and
                            Bolivia, upon the other, as persistently denies that right, that further
                            discussion would but lead to the reiteration of opinions heretofore
                            expressed, and not tend to the solution of the question of
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>These views were transmitted by me to the honorable Secretary of State of
                                <pb facs="0200" n="176" xml:id="pg_176"/> the United States who, in
                            a recent despatch, has communicated to me his opinion and instructions
                            upon the subject.</p>
                        <p>My government has observed with deep concern the gradual progress of
                            events tending to weaken the fraternal relations heretofore existing
                            between the neighboring states of Chili and Bolivia, and is ardently
                            desirous that these relations be strengthened and maintained, and that
                            the possibility of present or future misunderstanding be averted by a
                            timely appeal to the calmer judgment and patriotism of the two
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>It has been the custom of friendly nations, when amicable discussion has
                            proven ineffectual, and when all the resources of diplomacy have failed
                            to bring about a satisfactory settlement of questions pending between
                            them, to refer the points of law and fact involved to the arbitral
                            decision of some friendly power, whose award is invariably respected as
                            final and conclusive.</p>
                        <p>The fact that claims, whose decision principally depends upon the
                            settlement of the question of territorial jurisdiction now pending
                            between Chili and Bolivia, have been presented by this legation in
                            behalf of citizens of the United States for the consideration of your
                            excellency’s government, would of itself have furnished a motive for the
                            suggestion of a reference of that question to arbitration; but even had
                            such claims not existed, the profound interest felt by my government in
                            the welfare of the sister republics of this continent, and its earnest
                            desire for the preservation of the peace and harmony of the different
                            nations of America, would alone have been sufficient to authorize this
                            appeal.</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, instructed by my government to earnestly deprecate any
                            interruption to the hitherto cordial relations subsisting between the
                            republic of Chili and that of Bolivia, and to suggest to the government
                            of your excellency the wisdom and propriety of a reference of the
                            questions now in dispute between the two republics to the arbitral
                            decision of such friendly power as may be mutually agreed upon by the
                            plenipotentiaries of the respective governments.</p>
                        <p>In thus fulfilling the grateful commission intrusted to me, of proposing
                            an honorable and courteous mode of settlement of the complications which
                            have threatened to disturb those friendly relations between two sister
                            republics, whose welfare has ever been an object of solicitous interest
                            to the United States, I am led to entertain a just confidence in the
                            favorable reception by your excellency’s government of this proposition,
                            from the perusal of the eminently patriotic and fraternal notes
                            addressed by your excellency, upon the 30th of December last, to the
                            cabinets of Quito and Bogota, invoking, in eloquent terms, the
                            patriotism and loyalty of those states to prevent fratricidal combat,
                            and obtain by peaceful measures the just and honorable arrangement of
                            their difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I cannot find words more expressive, or language more appropriate, for
                            the utterance of my sentiments on this subject, than those of the notes
                            above-mentioned, and cordially adopt, slightly paraphrasing, the words
                            of your excellency. I am assured that the President of the United
                            States, in view of the present situation of America, has believed that
                            the noble self-denial natural to worthy and free nations, such as Chili
                            and Bolivia, would respond to the word of peace from a common friend,
                            and in that confidence does not waver in the hope that the respective
                            governments, making the patriotic sacrifice of some of their
                            pretensions, will submit themselves to the result of a friendly
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The great act to which the United States invite the republics of Chili
                            and Bolivia would be, under present circumstances, a lofty instance that
                            the states of America know how to lay aside their differences when the
                            voice of her true interest requires it, and that they can thus unite and
                            consolidate their power to avert all other peril which might threaten
                            them.</p>
                        <p>And I beg to assure your excellencies most earnestly that if the good
                            offices or friendly mediation of the United States might facilitate the
                            attainment of the object of the present note, your excellency may rely
                            with security that to such an end my government will omit no step
                            whatever, and that nothing would be <pb facs="0201" n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177"/> more grateful to it than to render to that of
                            Chili, as well as to that of Bolivia, these and any other friendly
                            services.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to renew to your excellency the assurances of
                            distinguished consideration and high esteem with which I am your
                            excellency’s most obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On the 29th of February last I had the
                            honor to receive the note which, under date of the 25th, your excellency
                            was pleased to address to me in regard to the boundary question pending
                            between Chili and Bolivia, and having given an account of its contents
                            to the President of the republic, I have been in structed by his
                            excellency to reply to it in the terms which I am about to use.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency assures me that you have examined with careful interest
                            the antecedents of that question, so far as published, and that, in your
                            opinion, any further discussion of the same would but lead the high
                            powers interested to a confirmation of their respective opinions,
                            sustained on either hand with equal pertinacity, and would be
                            ineffectual to produce the desired solution.</p>
                        <p>The government of the United States, to whom your excellency informs me
                            you have stated your views upon the question, has followed, with a
                            solicitude equal to that of your excellency, the gradual progress of
                            events tending to weaken the fraternal relations existing between Chili
                            and Bolivia, and as a means of impeding their interruption, thus
                            contrary to its ardent desire that they be maintained and strengthened,
                            has instructed your excellency to manifest to my government the
                            propriety and wisdom of submitting the differences alluded to to the
                            arbitration of a friendly power, chosen by mutual consent.</p>
                        <p>In connexion herewith your excellency is pleased to remind me that such
                            is the measure to which it is customary in similar cases, among friendly
                            nations, to appeal for the purpose of settling their controversies by
                            means of a final and conclusive decision; and your excellency adds, that
                            even had not certain claims of that legation in favor of citizens of the
                            United States, whose decision principally depends upon the settlement of
                            these differences, been submitted to the consideration of my government,
                            nor have furnished a sufficient motive for the vindication of the means
                            proposed, the profound interest felt by your government in the
                            prosperity of the sister republics of this continent, and its ardent
                            desire for the preservation of peace and harmony among all the nations
                            of America, would have been sufficient to authorize it.</p>
                        <p>In an opportune paraphrase which your excellency has made of my note of
                            December 30, last, addressed to the cabinets of Quito and Bogota, your
                            excellency concludes by signifying to me the confidence of your
                            government and your own that Chili and Bolivia would accept the adoption
                            of the arbitration indicated, and by giving me the assurance that the
                            government of the United States would omit no effort whatever to bring
                            about a good understanding, if its good offices or friendly mediation
                            might facilitate it.</p>
                        <p>In replying to the foregoing it is my duty, before all else, to comply
                            with the first and most grateful of the instructions which to that
                            effect I have received from the President of the republic, expressing to
                            your excellency the lively gratitude of his excellency for the friendly
                            steps taken by the government of <pb facs="0202" n="178" xml:id="pg_178"
                            /> the United States, through your worthy instrumentality. The President
                            recognizes therein an unequivocal proof of the excellent and cordial
                            spirit of fraternity entertained by the government of your excellency
                            towards Chili, and discovers a new motive for drawing closer the good
                            relations which happily she cultivates with the United States. The
                            generous sentiments manifested by the great republic towards the other
                            republics of America are, moreover, in the opinion of my government, a
                            certain promise of future prosperity for our continent, which can only
                            find her well-being and power in peace and liberty, based upon a sincere
                            union of all the American republics.</p>
                        <p>Such a union has ever been the object of the highest aspirations of
                            Chili, as has been clearly demonstrated by the traditional policy which
                            she has observed in her international relations. Good faith, equity,
                            concord, a spirit serene and open to conciliation—such have ever been
                            the motives of her policy. Ever disposed to make many sacrifices for the
                            preservation of peace, she has never refused, save such as would have
                            sullied her dignity or wronged her legitimate interests.</p>
                        <p>This policy and none other has my government pursued, in the case to
                            which your excellency is pleased to call my attention in its differences
                            with the government of Bolivia. While it is indeed true, as noted by
                            your excellency, that it has maintained its right to the dominion of the
                            territory in dispute with the energy and decision proper to a righteous
                            cause, it has not thought, as your excellency, that the discussion of
                            these titles, and of those presented and sustained with equal vigor by
                            Bolivia, must be fruitless. On the contrary, it believes that if such
                            discussion could have taken place, a good understanding would have been
                            arrived at, without much difficulty, and even without having recourse to
                            the good offices of a common friend. It would have been all-sufficient
                            for the representative of Bolivia to have brought to the debate
                            sentiments analogous to those of my government—sentiments of
                            conciliation and equity. Unfortunately the Bolivian legation was far
                            from entertaining such sentiments, and, confining itself to an
                            insuperable refusal to make the reparation due to Chili, has made
                            fruitless the preliminary discussion which my government has consented
                            to open for the purpose of smoothing the way toward that which would
                            have turned upon the main question, the question of boundary.</p>
                        <p>Thus has it been that this question has not even succeeded in entering
                            into debate, notwithstanding the loyal endeavors of my government toward
                            that object, and contrary to what was natural to presume, and to what
                            doubtless was believed, until the recent publication of the
                            correspondence of this department with the Bolivian legation.</p>
                        <p>How erroneous was such a conjecture has been already manifested by the
                            published correspondence; but perhaps, as is probable, it is not strange
                            that it should have occasioned the friendly action which the government
                            of Peru first, and later your excellency, have taken in the endeavor to
                            bring about a good understanding.</p>
                        <p>When the government of Peru tendered its good offices and friendly
                            mediation for the arrangement of the boundary question, my government
                            hastened to reply that this question not being in debate, and it being
                            impossible to discuss it until the difficulties opposed thereto were
                            removed, it found itself, with great regret, obliged to decline availing
                            itself at present of so generous an offer, which otherwise it would have
                            been happy to accept.</p>
                        <p>From that time to the present the state of affairs has undergone no
                            change whatever, favorable to mediation, or to any other means conducive
                            to a friendly and satisfactory solution. The conduct of Bolivia has
                            postponed the possibility of obtaining this result, which my government
                            has sought with so much solicitude. I find myself, therefore, obliged to
                            give to-day to your excellency the same reply which a short time since,
                            as I have manifested to your excellency, I gave to the government of
                            Peru.</p>
                        <pb facs="0203" n="179" xml:id="pg_179"/>
                        <p>In doing so I am Instructed to express to your excellency the profound
                            regret of my government at the rupture which has taken place in the
                            relations between Chili and Bolivia, and its firm resolve to avoid, in
                            so far as lies in its power, the painful consequences which may result
                            from this rupture. It entertains the confidence of being able to do so,
                            and even dares to hope that the government of Bolivia, permitting the
                            access of more benevolent and equitable views than it has up to the
                            present manifested, may return upon its steps, and offer to Chili the
                            just reparation necessary to render possible the tranquil and friendly
                            discussion of the pending differences.</p>
                        <p>Should this opportunity arrive, my government will seize it with
                            satisfaction, and endeavor to profit by it, seeking a proper solution,
                            either in the calm discussion of the titles alleged by the high powers
                            interested, or in the adoption of some other honorable and pacific
                            means. It will then be very grateful to recur, if necessary, to the
                            mediation of the government of the United States, and to thus manifest
                            how highly and gratefully it esteems the solicitous and fraternal
                            interest it has shown in this affair.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to reiterate to your excellency the expression of my
                            most distinguished consideration with which I am your excellency’s most
                            obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>On the 29th ultimo intelligence reached Valparaiso that the Chincha
                            islands, belonging to Peru, had been forcibly seized by her Catholic
                            Majesty’s squadron, under the command of Admiral Pinzon. The whole
                            country was immediately thrown into a state of the utmost excitement.
                            Immense public meetings were held in every province of the republic,
                            composed of all classes of the people of every shade of political
                            opinion. The speeches, resolutions, and proceedings of these meetings
                            evince a perfect frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm. Party lines, for the
                            time being, are obliterated in view of the common danger. In this city,
                            particularly, the popular sentiment is manifested in every mode in which
                            an <pb facs="0204" n="180" xml:id="pg_180"/> excited public opinion can
                            find voice. The press teems with inflammatory articles, the public
                            institutions echo their warlike tone, voluntary military organizations
                            are springing up all over the country, and a considerable sum has
                            already been subscribed to aid in the purchase of one or more iron-clad
                            vessels-of war. Various associations have tendered their services in a
                            body. The veterans of the war of independence, without an exception,
                            have offered themselves to the government to repel the insult to a
                            sister republic, to whose independence they had so materially
                            contributed. Never has the public sentiment of any country been more
                            earnestly and unmistakably manifested. All make common cause against
                            what they conceive to be the common enemy.</p>
                        <p>Every effort has been made to force the government into a warlike
                            attitude and its position became at once delicate and difficult. In the
                            absence of sufficient facts to form an accurate judgment as to the
                            designs of Spain, it was insisted that measures unfriendly, if not
                            hostile, should be immediately adopted.</p>
                        <p>For the purpose of allaying the popular excitement, as well as to define
                            the position of the government in this important crisis, Mr. Tocornal,
                            the minister for foreign affairs, published a circular addressed to the
                            “governments of America,” dated May 4, 1864, a copy and translation of
                            which I have the honor to enclose herein, marked A.</p>
                        <p>Although this document is eminently wise and patriotic, and at the same
                            time firm and decided in its tone in regard to the ground that Chili
                            should take in the event that her Catholic Majesty’s government mean to
                            exercise the right of “revindication” or reconquest; yet it was not
                            considered by the press or the people, in the heated condition of the
                            public mind, as sufficiently belligerent. Apparently nothing short of
                            immediate unconditional war would answer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tocornal, I am sorry to say, yielded to the popular clamor, and on
                            the 7th instant resigned his position. His resignation, under the
                            circumstances, I regard as a public calamity. The country thus loses, in
                            a most eventful period of its history, the services of one of its ablest
                            and most faithful public servants. I regret it the more as our official
                            and personal relations were most cordial, and because he has ever been a
                            steadfast and outspoken friend of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Don Alvaro Covarrubias was indicated as his successor, and on the 11th
                            instant I received the. official announcement of his appointment, to
                            which I responded the same day. (See enclosures B and C.)</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>No active hostilities having taken place since the occupation of the
                            islands by the Spanish squadron, the popular effervescence within the
                            past week has somewhat subsided, only, in my opinion, to break out with
                            increased violence if the conduct of Admiral Pinzon should be approved
                            by his government, or any further hostile acts should be committed. This
                            republic will undoubtedly make common cause with Peru. The government
                            will be irresistibly drawn into the conflict, or a domestic revolution
                            is inevitable.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that orders have been issued to government officials
                            along the coast to refuse coal and supplies to any Spanish vessel-of-war
                            that may touch at any port in Chili.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>In nearly all the public meetings that have been held, the change of
                            conduct and policy of European powers towards the republics of this
                            continent is attributed to the existence of the rebellion in the United
                            States. But for this, it is thought there would have been no
                            interference in the affairs of Santo Domingo, Mexico, or Peru. They,
                            therefore, most earnestly pray for the speedy suppression of the
                            rebellion and the reassertion of our traditional policy.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago, at a meeting of the officers, professors, and teachers of
                            the University of Chili, the following resolution was introduced by the
                            rector, the venerable jurisconsult Don Andres Bello, which was adopted
                            by acclamation:</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister:</hi>The occupation of the Chincha
                            islands by the naval forces of Spain, in the Pacific, has caused in the
                            mind of the government of Chili the most profound and painful
                            impression, and has awakened throughout the whole republic lively
                            alarms, which will make themselves equally felt from one extremity to
                            the other of the American continent.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner of her Catholic Majesty and the commander-in-chief of
                            her naval forces in the Pacific, under whose immediate responsibility
                            this act appears to have been perpetrated, have not been unaware of its
                            gravity, and have endeavored to justify it, setting forth in the
                            declaration issued from the anchorage of the Chincha islands the reasons
                            which have decided them to take this resolution.</p>
                        <p>If this measure be considered as an act of reprisal, undertaken for the
                            purpose of obtaining reparation for any injury or offence offered to
                            Spain by Peru, it is necessary to inquire whether the moment had arrived
                            to appeal to an almost extreme resource, when the pacific measures
                            employed among nations to avoid the calamities of war had not yet been
                            exhausted.</p>
                        <p>The right assumed by sovereign nations to do themselves justice has
                            well-defined proceedings, which the constant practice of nations has
                            erected into tutelar principles of peace and harmony, whereon repose the
                            mutual well-being of societies. To depart from them without a justifying
                            motive would be an offence affecting not only the interests of the
                            people towards whom it was offered, but also involving a deviation from
                            those common and obligatory laws, in whose faithful observance all the
                            members of the great family of sovereign and independent nations should
                            interest themselves.</p>
                        <p>The declaration issued by the commissioner of her Catholic Majesty and
                            the commander-in-chief of her Pacific squadron, besides being open to
                            just censure under the point of view indicated, involves the sanction of
                            principles which place in doubt the independence of Peru, provoking a
                            conflict for all America. The government of Chili, therefore, cannot
                            otherwise than reprobate, as it does, in the most explicit manner, such
                            doctrines, and protest against them, notwithstanding that it is
                            confident that they will not receive the sanction of the government of
                            her Catholic Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The independence of Peru and her existence as a free and sovereign nation
                            is a fixed fact, and it would be necessary to efface the history of half
                            a century to even place it in doubt, converting into a simple truce that
                            which has been and is a peace of indefinite duration, universally
                            accepted and recognized, in <pb facs="0206" n="182" xml:id="pg_182"/>
                            fact, by Spain herself in a long series of public and official acts. The
                            government of her Catholic Majesty for many years has not ceased to call
                            republic that which was formerly her colony; it repeats the same in the
                            credential of the commissioner which it has sent to Lima; it has
                            admitted her consuls, and consented that her ships frequent the ports of
                            the Peninsula; a reciprocal and uninterrupted commerce has been
                            maintained between the two countries, and finally Peruvians have been
                            considered as foreigners on the Peninsula, precisely as the Spaniards
                            have been considered in Peru. As a sovereign state Peru has entered into
                            treaties of peace, friendship, and commerce with nations of both
                            continents; and in presence of these facts, known to the government of
                            her Catholic Majesty, can the absence of a solemn recognition have any
                            importance in the eyes of truth and international law so as to found
                            thereon a state of truce? Every truce supposes a state of in
                            communication, and it may be even said that this characterizes it. Nor
                            is a close made to an armistice of long and indefinite duration without
                            previous notice of the intention to renew hostilities, an essential
                            formality, as we are taught by the constant practice of ancient and
                            modern nations.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of the commissioner of her Catholic Majesty and of the
                            commander-in-chief of her squadron in the Pacific, the crown of Castile
                            is disposed to revindicate the proprietorship of the Chincha islands,
                            and appears to derive this right as a legitimate corollary of the
                            supposed state of truce. A nation constituted for forty years,
                            exercising with independence rights belonging to sovereignty within the
                            entire precinct of its territory, is not, nor can it be, subject to the
                            right of revindication. The seizing of the Chincha islands by the
                            Spanish squadron in such case becomes a material act, consummated by
                            force, and, wanting in the proper characteristics of a legitimate act,
                            the right of vindication would become a true right of conquest.</p>
                        <p>The armies of Chili fought together with those of Peru in the war of
                            independence; the two republics were one in a common cause, as were also
                            all the American sections. Were hostilities again to break out, there
                            having been nothing but a truce <hi rend="italic">de hecho,</hi> (<hi
                                rend="italic">de facto,</hi>) what is the situation in which the
                            ancient belligerents and their allies would find themselves forcibly
                            placed throughout the entire continent?</p>
                        <p>The government of Chili, in presence of so grave an event, considers it
                            its undeniable duty to deny in the most public and solemn manner the
                            principles which serve as a base to the declaration, protests against
                            the occupation of the Chincha islands by the naval forces of her
                            Catholic Majesty, and does not recognize, and will not recognize, as the
                            legitimate owner of the said islands, any other power than the republic
                            of Peru.</p>
                        <p>I feel convinced, nevertheless, that the government of her Catholic
                            Majesty will not approve the principles proclaimed in that declaration,
                            since, if the principle of revindication be sanctioned, that of
                            reconquest would be approved by implication, and the American republics
                            would find themselves obliged to unite their forces in order to maintain
                            the integrity of the territory of a sister and independent republic. It
                            would be painful that the rapid and inevitable development of events
                            should cause complications to arise, either retarding the settlement of
                            an international question, to which the government of Peru manifests
                            itself disposed to lend due attention, so as to arrange in a stable and
                            permanent manner its differences with Spain, or preparing new
                            difficulties which considerations of a supreme order would counsel the
                            American governments to avoid opportunely.</p>
                        <p>The manifestation which I have just made, in compliance with the orders
                            which I have received from the President of the republic, will be
                            deemed, I trust, by the government of your excellency as the faithful
                            expression of sentiments common to all America. The government of ——,
                            abounding in the same sentiments, will be pleased doubtless to know the
                            views of that of Chili, <pb facs="0207" n="183" xml:id="pg_183"/> and
                            her disposition to act in accord and prevent a conflict which might
                            disturb the peace of this continent, interrupting the friendly relations
                            which happily she has cultivated, and earnestly desires to cultivate,
                            with the Spanish nation.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to offer to your excellency the testimony of my highest
                            consideration with which I subscribe myself your excellency’s most

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I thank you for the information you have
                            given me in your No. 127 concerning what has occurred in Chili in
                            relation to the seizure of the Chincha islands by the admiral of the
                            Spanish fleet in Peruvian waters.</p>
                        <p>Very full accounts of that controversy have been received here from Mr.
                            Robinson, our representative at Lima. At an early day Mr. Koerner, our
                            minister at Madrid, was instructed to use his good offices to arrest a
                            serious conflict, and effect a reconciliation between Spain and Peru.
                            Thus far we have no advices from Mr. Koerner upon the subject, but we
                            are now daily expecting his reply. Some incidents have occurred at
                            Madrid which enable us to hope that Spain will not proceed further in
                            the direction of hostilities. On the other hand we learn from Peru that
                            the admiral and the late commissioner of Spain have disavowed any design
                            or purpose to assail the sovereignty of Peru, and have defined the
                            seizure of the Chincha islands as an act of mere reprisal, and the
                            commissioner at the same time announced that he had resigned his special
                            trust. Your own proceedings in regard to the matter are fully
                            approved.</p>

                            was celebrated in this city by all ranks and classes of the people and
                            by all political parties with a cordiality and unanimity almost, if not
                            entirely, unprecedented. The whole population seemed to join in the
                            demonstration, and with a patriotic enthusiasm rarely surpassed in
                            similar celebrations in our own country, and certainly unparalleled
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>At daylight on the 4th instant the bands of the different military
                            organizations played “Hail Columbia” in front of their barracks instead
                            of the customary reveille, and at sunrise and at noon salutes were fired
                            by an American citizen who had obtained permission from the government
                            for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>At 7 o’clock the band of the artillery regiment appeared beneath the
                            windows of the legation and played our national airs. At noon, by order
                            of the President, every military band in the city, numbering over 200
                            performers, assembled in front of my residence, and in unison played
                            “Hail Columbia,” the “Star Spangled Banner,” and the national hymn of
                            Chili, while an aide-de-camp of his excellency called to tender the
                            congratulations of the President.</p>
                        <p>At the same hour, in obedience to a public call, a large mass meeting was
                            held upon the “Alameda,” or public walk, at the foot of the statue of
                            General San Martin, where enthusiastic and patriotic addresses
                            appropriate to the day were delivered by the members of the Society of
                            the American Union and others; after which, forming a procession, the
                            members of the Union bearing the flags of all the American republics,
                            with that of the United States at the head, marched to the legation.</p>
                        <p>Upon their arrival repeated and enthusiastic cheers burst from the
                            multitude for the United States, for American independence, for

                            and our own, I briefly addressed the multitude, thanking the government
                            and people of Chili for this hearty expression of sympathy and respect,
                            and invited the Society of the American Union, as representatives of
                            their fellow-citizens, to enter my house, where, during an hour or more,
                            a pleasant interchange of courtesies took place. I have the honor to
                            enclose herein a copy of my remarks. (Enclosure A.)</p>
                        <p>During the day the minister of foreign affairs, the secretary of the
                            treasury, the President, and secretary of the house, Admiral Blanco, and
                            a large number of officers of the government, members of Congress,
                            officers of the army and navy, municipality, &amp;c., and private
                            citizens, called to pay their respects. The republican members of the
                            diplomatic corps also called, while those of Europe sent their cards,
                            and all hoisted their flags in honor of the day.</p>
                        <p>In the evening the orchestra of the municipal theatre gave a beautiful
                            serenade at the legation, playing our own national airs and those of
                            Chili and Peru. These spontaneous manifestations by this government and
                            people are, I believe, unexampled.</p>
                        <p>The recent aggressive attitude of various European nations towards the
                            South American republics has awakened in the latter an interest, and
                            compelled a study of our own affairs, which have tended to convince them
                            that their only safety lies in the success of the Union arms and the
                            reassertion of our integrity and power as a nation. It is a source of
                            profound congratulation that the eminently wise and prudent course of
                            the government of the United States in its foreign relations is fully
                            understood and appreciated by the statesmen, the press, and the people
                            of Chili.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi> As the representative of the
                                government and people of the United States, and as an American
                                citizen, I am deeply grateful for this spontaneous and unparalleled
                                demonstration. I thank his excellency the President of the republic
                                for directing all the military bands of the city to come to this
                                legation to play the patriotic airs of both North and South America,
                                and also the leaders and members of those bands for the tasteful
                                manner in which they performed that duty.</p>
                            <p>Words cannot express the pleasing emotions excited in the hearts of
                                my countrymen and in my own by the thrilling music of our national
                                hymns, “Hail Columbia” and the “Star Spangled Banner,” admirably
                                played by more than two hundred instruments. We felt that we were no
                                longer strangers in a distant land, but among friends and brothers,
                                whose patriotic impulses, hopes, and aspirations were in unison with
                                our own.</p>
                            <p>I am deeply grateful for the spirit and enthusiasm I see here
                                manifested by so many thousands of your patriotic people, and for
                                the hearty <hi rend="italic">vivas</hi> with which you greet the
                                names of “Washington” and “Lincoln.” It tells me in a voice not to
                                be misunderstood—that the great heart of Chili is for the Union and
                                the success of the federal cause. I appreciate the significance of
                                this ovation and its moral effect, both here and elsewhere. It will
                                be most gratefully appreciated by the government and people of the
                                United States, and, above all, it will cheer and encourage the
                                patriotic soldiers who are perilling their lives upon the
                                battle-field for the sacred cause of freedom. It will cheer them to
                                know, that even in the darkest hour of the rebellion, when the life
                                of the nation seemed to be suspended by a thread, the government and
                                people of Chili never for one moment faltered in their devotion to
                                the cause of the Union. Your heartfelt prayers and aspirations have
                                ever been for the triumph of the federal arms, and the restoration
                                of our glorious Union.</p>
                            <p>And now again, in this most unequivocal manner, you have come to this
                                legation on this the jubilee of American independence, to tender me
                                your congratulations and sympathies, and to renew your devotion to
                                those great principles of liberty which form the basis of all free
                                    <pb facs="0210" n="186" xml:id="pg_186"/> governments—principles
                                which, on this day eighty-eight years ago, in the city of
                                Philadelphia, were first promulgated to the world. The causes which
                                inspired the declaration of American independence are stated in the
                                language of its great author, Thomas Jefferson. He and his
                                compatriots declared as self-evident truths, that “all men are
                                created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
                                rights; and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
                                happiness; that for the security of these rights government was
                                instituted, and that when it violates its trust, the governed might
                                abolish it.” Repeating the long list of grievances they had borne,
                                and appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of
                                their intentions, in the name and by the authority of the people,
                                the only fountain of legitimate power, they shook off forever their
                                allegiance to the British crown and proclaimed the United Colonies
                                    <hi rend="italic">a free and independent nation.</hi></p>
                            <p>That declaration of independence forms a new era in the history of
                                mankind. It questioned the divine right of kings, shook every throne
                                in Europe to its base, and taught them that there was a power behind
                                the throne greater than the throne itself—that <hi rend="italic">the
                                    voice of the people is the voice of God.</hi></p>
                            <p>That sacred declaration received the baptism of blood. Inspired by
                                its principles, and led by the immortal Washington, the patriot army
                                marched forth boldly, and, by the blessing of God, triumphantly.</p>
                            <p>Our success inaugurated that era of revolutions which resulted in the
                                emancipation of almost the entire western continent from European
                                domination. Emulating our example, the Central and South American
                                republics sprung into existence, and their elder sister, the United
                                States of America, ushered them into the family of nations.</p>
                            <p>The origin and principles of government of these republics being
                                substantially the same, and all founded upon our system, it is
                                obvious that they must share the same fate, and that they and the
                                system must stand or fall together. If we, who have tried the
                                experiment of a free government and popular institutions, under the
                                most favorable circumstances, fail in the attempt, I shall tremble
                                for the system throughout the world.</p>
                            <p>I wonder not, therefore, at the deep anxiety you manifest for the
                                success of our cause, because it involves the soundness or fallacy
                                of the principles enunciated in our declaration of independence. It
                                involves the great problem of human society, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >whether mankind can be trusted with a purely popular
                                    government</hi>—a problem in the solution of which you are as
                                much interested as the people of the United States.</p>
                            <p>But, gentlemen of the <hi rend="italic">Union Americana,</hi> you
                                comprehend the magnitude of the contest now progressing in my
                                country, and the mighty issues at stake. You understand that the
                                labors, sacrifices, and blood of the patriot heroes of the Union
                                army have not been expended merely to crush a gigantic rebellion and
                                restore a discordant Union—not merely to destroy the curse of human
                                slavery, the cause of all our troubles, but that we are also
                                struggling for that system of government whose origin we this day
                                commemorate and on which rest the hopes of the good and wise of
                                every land. The fate of the great principles which lie at the
                                foundation of all free republican governments is at stake—man’s
                                capacity for self-government. The victorious cannon of Grant will
                                soon solve these questions, finally and forever!</p>
                            <p>God be praised for the glorious victories in Virginia and Georgia,
                                and the prospect of an early close of the contest!</p>
                            <p>The fourth of July, 1863, was rendered memorable by the great
                                victories of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. May we not indulge the hope
                                that additional lustre will be thrown upon this glorious day by the
                                capture of Richmond and Atlanta?</p>
                            <p>When the last mail left New York, millions of exultant voices were
                                rejoicing over the success of the federal arms, and the certain
                                triumph of the great cause! Millions of the sons of liberty
                                throughout the world will soon echo the jubilant shout of Miriam the
                                prophetess: “Jehovah has conquered; His people are free.”</p>
                            <p>Soon will the glorious American Union be redeemed and regenerated!
                                Human slavery is doomed! A wall of living freemen will exclude this
                                fruitful element of strife, as the cherubim of God kept sin out of
                                Eden. Soon will European monarchs cease to interest themselves in
                                American affairs, and learn that two antagonistical systems cannot
                                permanently exist on this continent. <hi rend="italic">America will
                                    be ruled by Americans,</hi> and by its own chosen system of
                                government.</p>
                            <p>To maintain and enforce these principles, the soldier of Chili and
                                the soldier of the United States may yet march side by side to the
                                battle-field.</p>
                            <p>The republics of America will be united in strong and indissoluble
                                bonds of friendship, sympathy, and interest, and upon all great
                                international questions they will see and think alike, and act as
                                one people.</p>
                            <p>Again I return my thanks for this splendid demonstration, and
                                especially to the patriotic and enthusiastic members of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Union Americana,</hi> whose generous and liberal
                                sentiments, I trust, will soon be practically illustrated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            despatch No. 140, of the 11th ultimo, with your address to the society
                            known as the “Union Americana,” in Chili, delivered on the occasion of
                            their visit to the legation of the United States on the 4th of July,
                            1864.</p>
                        <p>The report which you transmit of the celebration by the government of
                            Chili and the residents of the city of Santiago of the 88th anniversary
                            of the independence of the United States of America is both gratifying
                            and satisfactory; such a manifestation tending, as it does, to
                            strengthen the bonds of friendship and good will which animate the
                            government and people of Chili towards our government and people, and
                            which, I am sure, are fully shared and cordially reciprocated on their
                            part.</p>
                        <p>You are therefore instructed to express this satisfaction to the
                            President of Chili in a communication to the minister for foreign
                            affairs of that republic, covering the subject referred to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>On the 7th instant, in obedience to your
                            instruction of the 18th of August, No. 73, I had the honor to address a
                            note to the secretary of foreign relations of the republic of Chili,
                            manifesting the gratification with which my government and the people of
                            the United States had learned the evidences of good will and friendship
                            exhibited by the government and people of Chili, upon the occasion of
                            the late anniversary of the independence of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I further stated that I had been instructed to express to the government
                            and people of Chili, and to the society of the “Union Americana” the
                            profound satisfaction experienced by the government and people I have
                            the honor to represent at these renewed proofs of friendship and
                            sympathy, and my trust that such sentiments may ever exist between the
                            two nations.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th instant his excellency replied, in a very cordial note,
                            reiterating similar expressions of earnest good will, and informing me
                            that he had been instructed by the President to express to me the
                            sincere satisfaction with which he had welcomed this new evidence of
                            reciprocal good understanding between the governments and the people of
                            the United States and Chili.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to transmit herewith, marked respectively A, B, and C,
                            copies of the correspondence above mentioned, together with a printed
                            copy of the same in Spanish from the official organ the “Americano.”</p>
                        <p>Under date of the 7th instant I also addressed a note to Mr. Covarrubias,
                            (D,) acknowledging the receipt of a communication from him, dated
                            September 29, and transmitting me a copy of the decree of the President
                            of the 27th ultimo, declaring coal to be contraband of war. Copies and
                            translations of these two latter documents accompanied my despatch No.
                            149, of September 30.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of certain publications copied into a portion of the press
                            of <pb facs="0212" n="188" xml:id="pg_188"/> Chili, from foreign and
                            prejudiced sources, and reflecting unfairly upon the foreign policy of
                            the government of the United States, I took occasion, in an interview
                            which I had with Mr. Covarrubias on the 8th instant, to explain to him
                            the true position of my government towards foreign powers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Covarrubias replied as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In the present position of the government of the United States, it must
                            be evident to the mind of any statesman of calm reasoning that the
                            position it has assumed in regard to its foreign relations could be none
                            other, in justice to the high and important interests involved in the
                            mighty struggle now in progress. Much as it might desire to intervene in
                            other American affairs, its hands are tied by domestic obligations which
                            it cannot ignore. In my opinion the present policy of the government of
                            the United States is temporary, not fixed and permanent, but born of the
                            very exigencies of the situation, and a natural consequence of the very
                            difficult position of its domestic affairs.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">The earnest sympathies of Chili are for the cause of
                                the Union, the cause of justice, right, and humanity, and under no
                                circumstances could those sympathies be enlisted in behalf of the
                                cause of the south.”</hi></p>
                        <p>This expression of sentiments, on the part of the secretary of foreign
                            relations, was most gratifying to me, and I assured his excellency would
                            be no less so to my government, to which I should take pleasure in
                            communicating it.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain your obedient servant,</p>

                            United States, on the 4th of July last, were of a character so marked
                            and gratifying that I addressed a special communication to my government
                            descriptive of that patriotic and enthusiastic demonstration.</p>
                        <p>The government and people of the United States received this intelligence

                            tending, as they do, to strengthen the sentiments of friendship which
                            animate the intercourse between the two republics, and which are shared
                            in and cordially reciprocated by my government as well as by the people

                        <p>I trust that such sentiments may ever continue to exist between Chili and

                            indissolubly bound together by similar ties of friendship and

                            <p>To all to whom these presents may come, greeting: Considering, 1st,
                                that, according to the principles and rules generally adopted by
                                civilized nations, all coal intended for the public vessels of one
                                nation engaged in hostile operations against another must be
                                considered, and, in fact, has been considered, as an article
                                contraband of war;</p>
                            <pb facs="0214" n="190" xml:id="pg_190"/>
                            <p>2d. That, in view of the late acts and declarations, respectively
                                made by the governments of Peru and of Spain, of the law recently
                                proclaimed in that republic, and of the re-enforcements which the
                                cabinet of Madrid is sending to the squadron occupying the Chincha
                                islands, it is impossible not to consider the two countries
                                mentioned, if not in a state of declared war, at least in
                                hostilities <hi rend="italic">de facto;</hi></p>
                            <p>And 3d. That it is the duty of loyal neutrality to prevent the
                                furnishing of contraband of war, by the taking away from the coasts
                                of Chili coal destined for the vessels of either of the
                                belligerents—</p>
                            <p>I have set forth the following declaration:</p>
                            <p>1st. Coal destined for the supplying of the public vessels of a state
                                employed in hostile operations against another state is an article
                                contraband of war.</p>
                            <p>2d. It is not lawful to take away from the coasts of Chili any
                                quantity of coal whatever destined for the purpose above
                                mentioned.</p>
                            <p>3. Those authorities of the republic whom it may concern will adopt
                                the necessary measures to prevent the infraction or eluding of the
                                present declaration.</p>

                        <p>Nothing particularly important has recently occurred in our domestic

                            there are indications of activity along the lines. It is not doubtful
                            that there is a decline of the insurrectionary spirit in the southern

                            April 16, No. 62, which contains a very interesting exposition of the
                            political situation of western Europe. Since it arrived I have received
                            news of the fall of Duppel, which, doubtless, lends a new complexion to
                            the war between Denmark and Germany.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that Mr. Corwin, availing himself of a leave of absence
                            granted in August last, expected to take his departure from Vera Cruz on
                            the 3d instant. The late accounts from Mexico show that the French
                            forces have encountered <pb facs="0217" n="193" xml:id="pg_193"/>
                            several reverses; but the statements are not very minute, and everything
                            that comes from that quarter, in the interest of either belligerent, is
                            believed to be much exaggerated. Nothing that has occurred there or in
                            Europe has been thought to furnish sufficient ground for a change of the
                            attitude which the United States has hitherto held in regard to
                            Mexico.</p>

                        <p>The Baron von Gerolt shortly goes on a leave of absence to Berlin. He has
                            been long in the service, and holds a distinguished rank in the
                            diplomatic society of this capital. During all the vicissitudes of our
                            affairs, while he has faithfully advocated and defended the interests of
                            his country, he has at the same time been a firm, frank, and hopeful
                            friend of this government and country. It will be especially agreeable
                            to me if you shall be able to impress upon the government of Prussia a
                            conviction that the Baron is held in the highest esteem and respect, not

                            nation’s credit is reviving under the fiscal conduct of Mr. Fessenden,
                            it excites a smile to read in your despatch that the latest telegraphic
                            advices you have, concerning affairs at home, were that our army was
                            harmless at Petersburg; that Sherman, with a starving army, had been
                            repulsed on his march into Georgia; and that the resignation of Mr.
                            Chase had unfavorably affected American securities.</p>

                        <p>I thank you for the exposition of Russian and Austrian policy, relative
                            to the provinces lately disputed with Denmark, with which you have

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>When I last wrote about affairs in Germany
                            and Prussia, I alluded to the increasing danger of a European war
                            arising from the Schleswig-Holstein controversy. The sudden and
                            unexpected death of the late King of Denmark, and the accession to the
                            throne of Christian IX, as King of Denmark and Duke of
                            Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg, under the terms of the so-called
                            “London protocol,” has brought on a crisis. Most of the Germans still
                            refuse to recognize the succession of King Christian in the duchies, and
                            declare for Prince Frederick of Augustenburg, who has issued a
                            proclamation, pronouncing himself the legitimate and rightful Duke of
                            Schleswig-Holstein. All Germany is aglow with patriotic excitement and
                            enthusiasm; and men and means are freely offered <hi rend="italic"
                                >by</hi> the people “for the rights and deliverance from foreign
                            oppression of their German brethren” in these duchies. The German Diet
                            has refused admittance to a representative of King Christian, and
                            although it has not yet received the representative of the Duke
                            Frederick, the middle and smaller states of Germany are ready for that
                            step too. Prussia and Austria, although the representatives of the
                            people in both countries strongly declare for action, are still holding
                            back, declaring themselves bound by the London treaty of 1852, hut they
                            will be unable to prevent the passage of a resolution by the other
                            members of the Diet, declaring for an immediate occupation of Holstein
                            by federal troops, no longer in the sense of a federal execution, for
                            that would involve a recognition of King Christian as Duke of Holstein,
                            but for the purpose of possessing themselves of a German land, until it
                            can be delivered to its rightful sovereign. The large Danish force at
                            present stationed at Holstein will then have to evacuate it, or a
                            collision must inevitably ensue; and hostilities once having commenced,
                            a war by no means limited to Germany and Denmark will be the result.</p>
                        <p>England, in presence of these developments, has assumed a most
                            threatening attitude towards Germany, while Napoleon, annoyed by the
                            refusal of England to participate in his Paris congress, has not
                            definitely indicated what position he will occupy in the matter. These
                            complications make assurances doubly sure regarding the impossibility of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch No. 8, dated November 30, 1863. It makes
                            mention only of my communication to you numbered 16, and dated November
                            10. Can it be that two others preceding it, numbered 14 and 15, and
                            dated October 24 and 31, 1863, respectively, have failed to reach
                            you?</p>
                        <p>The Schleswig-Holstein question has assumed a less warlike aspect. The
                            efforts of Austria and Prussia have compelled the federal diet to simply
                            decree an execution against the King of Denmark, instead of an
                            occupation and sequestration of Holstein. This, of course, involves a
                            recognition in fact of the King of Denmark as Duke of Holstein, and the
                            maintenance of the London protocol. England and Russia, the two powers
                            most interested in the preservation of that treaty, have come to an
                            understanding with Austria and Prussia to the effect that they shall
                            compel the Danish ministry to abrogate the constitution incorporating
                            Schleswig, lately adopted, and which is to go into operation on the
                            first of January next; and also to institute the reforms in Holstein and
                            Lauenburg which were promised but never carried out by Denmark. If this
                            is done—and it seems most unlikely that Denmark will refuse to comply
                            with the demands of England and Russia—Austria and Prussia, on their
                            part, are to see to it that the other German states shall relinquish
                            their efforts in behalf of Prince Frederick of Augustenburg, who claims
                            the succession in the duchies. Denmark, it appears now, will continue to
                            exist as heretofore, and Germany once more be disappointed in its hope
                            and aspirations for national unity and power. It is true, German troops
                            are on their way to enter Holstein; and, although it is reported, on
                            good authority, that on their arrival the Danish troops will withdraw,
                            this may yet give a turn to affairs not apprehended by the cabinets at
                            the present hour.</p>
                        <p>The government of Prussia has applied to the Chambers for twelve million
                            thalers, to be raised by a loan, to defray the expenses for arming and
                            equipping the Prussian contingent, and for fortifying the coast. But, as
                            the position taken by the government is so entirely unsatisfactory to
                            the people, the Chamber of Deputies will not vote the loan. An address
                            to his Majesty is again to be resorted to, praying him to recede from
                            the London protocol, to change the present system, and, in that event,
                            pledging him all the resources of the country. It is, however, plain
                            that this step will prove futile, resulting in the closing of the
                            Chamber rather than in the dismissal of the ministry.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Accounts of the meeting and organization of
                            Congress, and also the President’s message, have been received through
                            the English papers, no American papers having as yet arrived here later
                            than of the 8th instant. The <pb facs="0221" n="197" xml:id="pg_197"/>
                            comments of the German press on the message are in a high degree
                            favorable. The striking contrast between President Lincoln’s exhibition
                            of the state of our national affairs with that of the rebel pretender
                            Davis, which has likewise been published, has not failed to impress the
                            public mind in Germany, and the conviction that the rebellion will come
                            to a speedy end is again fully established.</p>
                        <p>The paragraph of the President’s message on the subject of European
                            emigration, in connexion with the free homestead law, is receiving
                            particular attention on the part of the German press; and it is conceded
                            that emigration from Germany would be very considerably increased if our
                            Congress could devise some mode by which persons desiring to emigrate
                            might be provided a free passage to our shores. While many thousands of
                            young and robust men, whose services would prove exceedingly valuable to
                            our land, possess means sufficient to subsist them for a brief period
                            after their arrival in America, they are unable to defray the expense of
                            the passage, and are thus compelled to remain here. Had this legation
                            possessed the necessary means and authority, it could have sent at least
                            a thousand able-bodied and intelligent men during the present year. A
                            free passage for emigrants to America should, therefore, be the chief
                            object of any measures which Congress, in response to the President’s
                            recommendation, may deem proper to adopt.</p>
                        <p>The President’s firm declaration to stand by and uphold his proclamation
                            of freedom is likewise receiving the just admiration and approval of
                            enlightened Germany. It is now well understood that the people of
                            America, of whatever party, are come to the conclusion that the Union
                            shall be maintained, and that slavery shall have an end. * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Since my last report of the Schleswig-Holstein question the Danish troops
                            have evacuated the latter duchy, and federal troops have entered. The
                            government of Holstein and Lauenburg has also been assumed by the two
                            federal commissioners accompanying the troops. On the part of the
                            people, this has been followed everywhere by great demonstrations of
                            rejoicing. All towns of importance are proclaiming the Prince of
                            Augustenburg their rightful sovereign. The same step has been taken by
                            nearly all the members of the Holstein assembly, lately called together
                            for consultation. In the federal diet, too, a new movement has sprung up
                            in his favor. Bavaria, Saxony, and Wurtemburg are believed to be united
                            and ready for his recognition; and if this be really so, Austria and
                            Prussia may not be able after all to prevent it. Popular enthusiasm and
                            excitement in Germany is running higher and higher, and it will be no
                            easy task to repress it. Meanwhile an event of great moment has
                            transpired in Denmark, the news of which has just been received here.
                            The ministry Hall has given in its resignation. The King has accepted
                            it. The Reichsrath, just dissolved, is to be reconvened immediately, and
                            the constitution adopted in November to be rescinded. The King himself
                            will leave Copenhagen for the army in Schleswig. These measures would
                            undoubtedly aid the chances of a peaceable solution of the whole
                            question. It is evident that King Christian is anxious for such a
                            result. A revolution, however, in Copenhagen, on the part of the
                            ultra-Danish party, hitherto in power, and the proclamation of Prince
                            Oscar, of Sweden, as King of Scandinavia, is by no means an event
                            unlikely to happen. A few days will now suffice to determine the final
                            result of the controversy.</p>
                        <p>The Chambers here have adjourned over the Christmas holidays, and will
                            not meet again until the 4th of January next. The Chamber of Deputies
                            has voted the address which I reported to be in contemplation, but his
                            Majesty has refused to receive the deputation charged with its delivery
                            to him. So the document had to be transmitted through the president of
                            the ministry, Herr von Bismark. The answer of his Majesty has not yet
                            been given. It will consist in a flat refusal to entertain the
                            propositions of the Chamber. The King, <pb facs="0222" n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198"/> it is now ascertained, is entirely adverse to a
                            war. He has been ill for some days past, but is recovering.</p>
                        <p>The Prince Royal, with his family, after a long absence in England, has
                            returned, and so has her Majesty the Queen. The King’s conduct having
                            alienated the good-will of the people of Berlin, none of the usual
                            demonstrations have occurred on their return.</p>

                            developed, as most of the European states are. Theirs are the theories
                            which always look up to the rulers as the fountain of all power, honor,
                            and emolument, instead of, as with us, looking to the people as the
                            great fountain of power. Our experiences will not only restore, but
                            greatly increase, that confidence in republican institutions. that was
                            so rudely shaken in the early part of our struggle with the
                            rebellion.</p>
                        <p>There cannot be a general European war without leaving, as a result, more
                            rights and power with the masses, and reducing, again, the number of
                            those that rule by authority of dynasties. The three hundred and odd
                            governing dynasties that existed in Germany barely a century since are
                            now reduced to thirty-one. The small ones now tremble at the activity
                            and development, politically, of their peoples, and feel that the next
                            upheaving will lessen their number, as several are only maintained in
                            their position by the influence of the larger powers in favor of what is
                            called established order.</p>
                        <p>The complications and proceedings in the Schleswig-Holstein controversy
                            occupy the attention of people, diplomats, and kings, almost to the
                            exclusion of all other affairs. The excitement of the people of Germany
                            is forcing the rulers, and there are no states in Germany, except
                            Prussia and Austria, that attempt to stem in any manner this current.
                            Austria, whose empire is less German than any other, successfully
                            resists, and, while it joins in certain demands of Denmark favorable to
                            the German population of the duchies, is opposed to the claims set up by
                            Prince Frederick of Augustenburg. The ministry of Prussia desire to
                            maintain the same position, but the king is influenced to some extent by
                            the popular feeling of the kingdom, which demands the separation of the
                            duchies from Denmark and the acknowledgment of the claims of the Prince
                            of Augustenburg as lawful ruler thereof.</p>
                        <pb facs="0223" n="199" xml:id="pg_199"/>
                        <p>Holstein and Lauenburg are already in possession of the troops acting
                            under the orders of the federal Diet, and the Danish officials have
                            either been supplanted, left the provinces, or acknowledged the
                            authority of the civil commissioners that accompany the expedition, and,
                            under the eyes and within the hearing of these commissioners, a new
                            dynasty is being proclaimed. The Saxon and Hanoverian troops are now in
                            occupation, and they, as well as their nations, sympathize with Prince
                            Frederick. Prussian and Austrian troops are moving towards, and are in,
                            the duchies, and the ruling powers of these countries desire that the
                            Diet shall pronounce upon the Prince of Augustenburg’s title before they
                            define their position upon the question. Austria is against setting up
                            the prince as duke, in any event; Prussia may or may not be, according
                            as it sees safety in resisting the popular demand.</p>
                        <p>The immediate question now is, will Schleswig be occupied? It is believed
                            that the attempt to do it will lead to a collision and war, and the
                            rulers of Europe fear war at the present time. The German people are for
                            it, as they say, in defence of, and for the protection of, their
                            oppressed brethren in the duchies; and with many there is another
                            underlying motive, and that is the belief that a general war will bring
                            in its train a relief from some of the dynastic influences that press
                            down the liberal element.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty the King of Prussia is still in disagreement with his people
                            and their representatives in the legislature. He asked for twelve
                            millions, to meet the exigencies of the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty,
                            and, notwithstanding the strong desire on the part of the people that
                            Prussia should actively interfere in these matters, their
                            representatives refuse the money, demanding a change of the ministry,
                            and giving as their reason that they have no faith in the proper
                            application of the funds if intrusted to the present ministry.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch to Mr. Kreismann, as chargé
                            d’affaires, No. 9, and dated January 7, 1864, is received.</p>
                        <p>The interior politics of Prussia, and the contest between the ministers
                            and the Chamber of Deputies, have again culminated in a prorogation of
                            the two houses. The budget for the current year, presented by the
                            ministry to the Chambers, contained the oft rejected items for the
                            reorganization of the army, and the same overwhelming majority again
                            rejected these items.</p>
                        <p>The ministry also asked authority to make a loan of twelve millions, to
                            meet the expenses to be incurred by the Prussian government in
                            performing its obligations as a member of the German Bund in the federal
                            execution in Holstein, and his Majesty, in a message in response to the
                            address voted by the second Chamber, pledged his royal word that the
                            funds should be applied to the object specified. The house refused to
                            authorize the loan, and, in addition, resolved that a loan effected
                            without its sanction would be a violation of the constitution, and its
                            repayment would not be obligatory upon Prussia. In the conduct of
                            Prussian finances it has been for years the practice not to anticipate
                            revenue, but to use <pb facs="0224" n="200" xml:id="pg_200"/> the
                            collections of a previous to pay the expenses of the current year, any
                            surplus remaining from appropriations being hoarded in the vaults of the
                            old castle, as a reserve fund to meet contingencies. This fund had been
                            accumulating for years, and no one knew (except a board of
                            commissioners, specially charged by the King with its control and safe
                            keeping) what sum was in the vault. The Chamber of Deputies desired to
                            investigate and examine the accounts of the funds there kept in coin,
                            but was refused, on the ground that it was not subject to the control of
                            the house nor to the legislative action. It is supposed that the
                            government will resort to this fund to meet the expenses for which
                            authority to contract a loan was asked, but refused.</p>
                        <p>It is true the prorogation of the Chambers leaves the ministry, as at the
                            close of the two preceding sessions, without any budget constitutionally
                            established; but they are enabled to carry on the government without the
                            aid of the Chambers, from the fact that, under the existing revenue
                            laws, an income sufficient is obtained to meet all ordinary requirements
                            and disbursements of the government. It is only in the establishment of
                            new taxes that the Chambers would become indispensable. The revenues of
                            the kingdom are annually increasing, amounting at present to nearly one
                            hundred and thirty millions of thalers.</p>
                        <p>With such a revenue system, and a royal decree to expend the funds
                            derived therefrom, the ministry is independent of the Chambers and the
                            constitution, so long as no extraordinary taxation is required, and the
                            people submit to this nullifying of their constitution. Without a
                            general convulsion in Europe, this position of antagonism between the
                            government and the representatives of the people, and the people
                            themselves, may continue for a long time. In fact the wisest liberals
                            fail to perceive any mode of regaining any power or control in the
                            affairs of the kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Revolution is not in the character of the people, and, while officially
                            maintaining their rights without flinching, the liberal members urge
                            upon the people to avoid all violence and not to give a welcome pretext
                            to strike a blow entirely destroying all hopes for liberal reforms to
                            those controlling an army amounting on a peace footing to two hundred
                            and forty thousand men.</p>
                        <p>The people of Prussia are a thoroughly loyal people. They are
                            administratively well governed, their taxes not burdensome, and in the
                            main they are prosperous and advancing in political knowledge and
                            experience, but their progress in this direction has not yet reached the
                            sublimity of fighting for an idea, viz: constitutional rights—the
                            practical benefits of which are but little understood by the masses of
                            the present generation of Prussians. No violent contest with the ruling
                            powers will occur, except in the event of a general European convulsion,
                            and probably not then, as long as Prussian arms are successful.</p>
                        <p>As I advised you in my last despatch, the federal troops of Saxony and
                            Hanover have, by order of the Bund, completely occupied Holstein, which
                            is being governed by federal commissioners. The Diet stopped at this
                            point and entered upon the consideration of the question as to the right
                            of succession in that duchy, as between Prince Frederick of Augustenburg
                            and Christian IX, King of Denmark, when Prussia and Austria introduced a
                            proposition in the Diet to proceed to occupy Schleswig. The Diet refused
                            to concur, because the occupation of Schleswig appeared not to be in the
                            interest of a union of the duchies with Germany, under the Prince of
                            Augustenburg as duke, whereupon Austria and Prussia set the authority of
                            the Diet aside, by declaring that they should henceforth take the whole
                            matter into their own hands as European powers and as the parties to the
                            London protocol and the stipulations of 1851 and 1852.</p>
                        <p>They at once commenced the movement of large bodies of troops to the
                            frontier of Schleswig, and demanded of Denmark the revocation of the
                            constitution of last November incorporating Schleswig into the Danish
                            monarchy.</p>
                        <pb facs="0225" n="201" xml:id="pg_201"/>
                        <p>On the first day of the present month the troops began to enter
                            Schleswig, and the first collision between the Prussians and Danes
                            occurred on the same day at Eckernforde. So far as reported, the contest
                            was between some vessels-of-war stationed in the harbor of Eckernforde
                            and a battery of Prussian rifled artillery, and resulted in the vessels
                            being compelled to retire out of reach of the guns. After which the town
                            was occupied by the Prussian troops without serious resistance.</p>
                        <p>Austria and Prussia evidently intend to throw troops enough into
                            Schleswig to overcome the Danish forces before any aid can possibly come
                            to them from abroad. The allies must have upwards of seventy-five
                            thousand men on the spot, while the Danish forces are estimated at forty
                            thousand; but they occupy a very strong position in a series of
                            earthworks, some fifteen miles in extent, known as the “Danneoirke.”
                            There is now no appearance from this standpoint that any foreign power
                            will come to the aid of Denmark, and the complete occupation of
                            Schleswig will be a mere question of time. Denmark cannot successfully
                            resist the force that is being brought against it.</p>
                        <p>The occupation completed, it will have relieved the German population in
                            the duchies of Danish control, and I do not believe that the German
                            powers dare restore them to Denmark. This long-pending dispute has once
                            before sought a solution on the field of battle, the only result of
                            which was an increase of the repressive measures by Denmark, the
                            increase of the discontent of the governed, and the still deeper
                            dissatisfaction of the whole German people. The Germans have felt so
                            much and thought so long upon this question, that such an act as a
                            repeated surrender of the duchies to Denmark, after a victorious
                            campaign, would produce an excitement which the rulers would scarce wish
                            to face.</p>
                        <p>From the German standpoint it is our brethren, a superior race, oppressed
                            and trodden down by an inferior race, against law and right, at the feet
                            of dynasties, or dynastic interests, and hence the Germans are enlisted
                            heart and soul in the question.</p>
                        <p>In this kingdom the Schleswig-Holstein is stronger even than the interior
                            constitutional struggle. There are three solutions of the question of
                            occupation:</p>
                        <p>First. The restoration to Denmark, with guarantees, of the rights and
                            freedom of the people of the duchies.</p>
                        <p>Second. The establishment of the Prince of Augustenburg as Duke of
                            Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
                        <p>Third. The annexation of the duchies to Prussia.</p>
                        <p>Herr Von Bismark, his Majesty’s minister of foreign affairs, is believed
                            to be in favor of the first; his Majesty himself preferring the last
                            proposition. The people of Germany, I am inclined to believe, would
                            gladly accept either of the last two modes of solving the question,
                            rather than have the duchies revert to Denmark.</p>
                        <p>If his Majesty separates from his minister upon this question, and
                            carries out a vigorous German policy, the way is open to a restoration
                            of a good understanding between himself and his people. It is thought
                            that the initiative is taken—that the King will act, holding that the
                            commencement of actual hostilities has relieved him from all former
                            treaty and protocol obligations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your confidential circular, dated January 13, 1864.</p>
                        <p>Since my last despatch the progress of affairs in Schleswig has been
                            rapid and significant. The allied army crossed the boundary on the 1st
                            instant, the Prussians having the right and the Austrians the left of
                            the advance. The Danes retired, skirmishing, before this advance to
                            their fortifications called the “Dannewerke.” An attack upon a portion
                            of the fortifications at Missunde, by the Prussians, was repulsed. The
                            Austrian advance was met with stubborn but unsuccessful resistance until
                            it had reached that portion of the “Dannewerke” which covered the city
                            of Schleswig, the capital of the duchy. Preparations for crossing the
                            Schlei, at a considerable distance from the point first attacked by the
                            Prussians, and thus turning the left of the Danish army and interposing
                            thereby a part of the Prussian corps between that army and its base of
                            supplies, line of retreat, and connexion with Denmark, caused the
                            abandonment of these fortifications and a retreat to Fleusburg. The
                            Danes had not troops enough to defend them, as well as the line of the
                            Schlei, against the immense force of Prussians and Austrians. Several
                            engagements occurred during this retreat between the Austrian advance
                            guard and the Danish rear guard. From Fleusburg the Danish army retired
                            to the fortifications on the island of Alsen, still within the limits of
                            Schleswig, while a portion of the troops went forward to strengthen the
                            garrison of the fortress at Fredericia. The Danes fought bravely, and
                            nothing but the overwhelming force of the Prussians and Austrians caused
                            the retreat. The course of the war thus far has been a repetition of
                            that of 1848. The attack, the line of retreat, and, in some instances,
                            the battle-fields, are almost identical, and the two armies are now
                            resting, the campaign apparently ended for the present.</p>
                        <p>The political complications growing out of the action of Prussia and
                            Austria bid fair to become very serious in Germany. The German element
                            in the duchy has proclaimed the Prince of Augustenburg, at Schleswig,
                            the capital, and other places, as the legal ruler. That has been met by
                            a proclamation by the commander-in-chief of the allied forces, Field
                            Marshal Wrangel, prohibiting any further demonstrations, the appointment
                            of civil commissioners, and the organization of a civil administration
                            for the duchy, retaining most of the present Danish officials in
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The intimations, official and otherwise, put forth by Prussia and
                            Austria, look to the re-establishment of the authority of Denmark over
                            the duchies after a redress of the grievances of the German population
                            thereof. So thoroughly is that belief fixed in the German public mind
                            that the excitement caused by the hope of a German rule in the duchies,
                            and which in the beginning was so universal, has cooled down, or rather
                            taken the direction of hatred towards Prussia and Austria.</p>
                        <p>Bavaria has called a congress of ministers from the minor German states
                            to consult as to the best means of resisting the claims and pretensions
                            of Austria and Prussia to act in German affairs in character as European
                            powers, and without the consent and against the wishes of the Diet. The
                            present feeble union of Germany is seriously threatened by these
                            complications, and if the allied powers carry out the intentions imputed
                            to them of excluding from Holstein the army of execution, sent there
                            under federal resolve, and the rival administration authorized by the
                            Diet, there will be an end of the existence of the Bund, and it is
                            difficult to see how a collision among the German powers could then be
                            avoided. The evident design of Prussia and Austria is so to conduct the
                            Schleswig <pb facs="0227" n="203" xml:id="pg_203"/> affair as to make
                            its final settlement a European question, and by that means to divide
                            with others the odium which would arise again in Germany against the
                            authors of a second surrender of a German land to the rule of a foreign
                            nationality.</p>
                        <p>The explanation of the policy of the Prussian minister for foreign
                            affairs, Von Bismarck Schoenhausen, as he is in reality the chief and
                            leading spirit in the entire movement, is found in the general
                            discontent of Prussia at the destruction of its constitutional rights,
                            the wide-spread liberalism and tendencies to unity throughout all the
                            states of Germany—all of which found a common rallying point or centre
                            for political influence and action in the sympathy for the German people
                            in the duchies—and in the attempt to establish another constitutional
                            state, the location of which would weaken the dynastic policy now in
                            vogue in Prussia; the army mobilized so as to be ready for
                            contingencies, the influence of the smaller states weakened, and the
                            authority of the Diet substantially overthrown. It was believed that the
                            constitutionalism, or democracy, as they call it, would be overawed, and
                            “divine right” again constitute the assumed basis of government.</p>
                        <p>England will not fight. France sits quiet, seeing its
                            “congress-of-nations” policy forced upon Europe in spite of England’s
                            refusal.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch, No. 65, dated February 1,
                            1864, is received.</p>
                        <p>The belief in the final suppression of the rebellion and the
                            re-establishment of the authority of our government over the entire
                            territory of the Union is now almost universal throughout Germany. The
                            leading reactionary papers in Berlin, which, during all the struggle,
                            have omitted no opportunity to disparage our cause, now give utterance
                            to the prevailing opinion as to the condition of affairs in the United
                            States. This change of opinion is marked and radical, notwithstanding
                            the false and garbled news that is telegraphed throughout Europe on the
                            arrival of every steamer. The sensation reports in our newspapers, which
                            magnify the most trivial movement of the rebels into something of great
                            strategical importance, and, for want of real events, keep constantly
                            parading their fears of threatened interruption of important lines of
                            communication, proposed invasions, fancied sieges, blockading of the
                            Mississippi, abandonment of places occupied by the Union forces,
                            &amp;c., are now regularly sent over the wires on the arrival of every
                            steamer, but they have ceased to mislead or alarm any intelligent
                            person. Events on this side of the ocean have drawn public attention
                            from our affairs, and the impressions of ultimate success which had been
                            made before the commencement of the war here are not affected by what
                            appears to be the winter amusement of our own newspapers.</p>
                        <p>The military movements in Schleswig remain as I advised you in my last
                            despatch. The Danish troops are mostly in the fortifications and on the
                            island of Alsen, and their vessels-of-war are co-operating to prevent a
                            further advance. The Prussian army is now lying in front of these
                            fortifications, preparing for further movements. It is almost impossible
                            to determine with accuracy what happens with the army, as the habit of
                            exaggeration, which prevailed at one <pb facs="0228" n="204"
                                xml:id="pg_204"/> time in our country, in relation to military
                            transactions, has been dwarfed by the capacity shown in Germany for
                            military “roorbacks.” Shakspeare, were he living, would have left old
                            Sir John and his men in buckram in obscurity and immortalized these
                            German sensation-mongers. As a specimen, the telegraph killed and
                            wounded a thousand men in Fleusburg, and the brave troopers swept over
                            barricaded streets with a fury known only to patriots. Humble truth
                            later decided that nobody had fought there, and consequently nobody was
                            hurt. Canting hypocrites on this side have pitied the sufferings of our
                            soldiers, and censured the government for indifference and improvidence,
                            and yet this winter campaign in Schleswig has developed that a military
                            government with a standing army of 200,000 men, and magazines supposed
                            to be full of war supplies and munitions, had no tents, no blankets, no
                            stockings; the overcoats rotten and dropping to pieces after a few days’
                            wear; the commissariat and hospital arrangements utterly deficient, so
                            that the wounded soldier is snowed in and frozen to death before being
                            cared for, and the living sustains life from his own animal vigor, half
                            fed, unsheltered, among the snows of Schleswig, and all this within a
                            distance of fifteen or twenty hours from this capital.</p>
                        <p>The question as to who were the belligerent parties has agitated German
                            diplomacy for several days. There has been no declaration of war upon
                            either side. The troops of the Bund, pursuant to the order of the Diet,
                            occupied Holstein, a province belonging to the German confederation. The
                            Danes, although affirming that such occupation would be hostile, retired
                            without conflict before the advancing troops of the Bund, until the
                            whole of Holstein was in possession of these troops under the decree of
                            execution. At this point Austria and Prussia asked permission of the
                            Diet to occupy Schleswig, in order to secure a guarantee that Denmark
                            would fulfil its obligations to the German subjects in the duchies, as
                            claimed to exist under the treaty of 1852. The authority being refused
                            by the Bund, the two powers announced their determination to carry out
                            their views and intentions independently of the Diet, and accordingly
                            concentrated their armies and invaded Schleswig. There was still no
                            declaration of war. On the contrary, they announced that they came for
                            peaceable purposes. Denmark met them on the borders, and, considering
                            the course of the allies a hostile proceeding, the conflict and actual
                            war commenced.</p>
                        <p>Denmark has settled for herself the status, and recognized war as
                            existing with all the states of Germany. The hostile act for which she
                            holds the states of Germany, other than Prussia and Austria,
                            responsible, is the permission allowed to the troops intended for the
                            invasion of Schleswig to pass through the territory of Holstein, then in
                            possession of the federal army of occupation, and civilly administered
                            by commissioners appointed by the Diet. Following out this status,
                            Denmark has established an admiralty court, and, it is believed, will
                            proceed to blockade the ports of Germany. German vessels in Danish ports
                            have been seized, without giving them the customary time to leave,
                            although it is asserted that Denmark is ready to come to an agreement,
                            so as to release again all those vessels that may have been seized
                            before a certain time. This course of Denmark has been met by Prussia
                            and other German states by at once placing an embargo upon Danish
                            vessels within their ports, and the Diet, a few days since, has decreed
                            an embargo upon all Danish shipping in all the German harbors. The text
                            of the regulations established by Denmark regarding the blockade and the
                            seizure of ships has not yet been received here, so that I am unable to
                            advise of their precise effect; but they establish a condition of war
                            with all of Germany. The representatives of German states, which have
                            seaports, have informed me that such is the attitude of Denmark towards
                            their respective states. Denmark has naval strength enough to put an end
                            to German commerce in the North sea and the Baltic; to close the mouths
                            of the two most important rivers, the Weser and the Elbe, and so destroy
                            for the present the foreign commerce of Bremen and Hamburg. <pb
                                facs="0229" n="205" xml:id="pg_205"/> This successfully done, and
                            again England profits by the distress of her neighbors, and seizes more
                            of the carrying trade.</p>
                        <p>There will be no war by England in favor of the Danes. The same interests
                            and influences which in our own case caused it to close its eyes to a
                            violation of its own municipal laws, and to the disregard of the law of
                            nations on the subject of hostile armaments, will regulate its conduct
                            in the Dano-German conflict. It is in the power of the Emperor of France
                            to change and determine the whole question, and he waits and
                            watches.</p>
                        <p>To-day it is rumored that the allied forces are advancing from Schleswig
                            into the Danish province of Jutland, thus leaving behind the professed
                            objects in the invasion of Schleswig, and assuming the full hostile
                            responsibility of invasion.</p>
                        <p>Internal matters in Germany are, meanwhile, assuming every day a more
                            threatening aspect. I advised you in my last despatch of a convention of
                            ministers of the smaller states, called by Bavaria, to meet at Wurzburg.
                            It has met and adjourned, but its proceedings are not yet before the
                            public. The minister for foreign affairs, in this kingdom, seems to
                            revel in these complications. The Prussian government has ordered the
                            mobilization of another army corps, to be stationed in the province of
                            Silesia, on the border of Saxony.</p>
                        <p>It is said that the Saxon government has received assurances from the
                            Emperor of France that in case of actual aggression on the part of
                            Prussia he would sustain the smaller states of Germany, and so Germany
                            itself may yet become the theatre of war, in which case it is generally
                            believed Austria would be found taking the side against Prussia.
                            Already, voices are being heard in the Austrian press protesting against
                            Herr Von Bismarck’s course against the members of the Bund, and
                            apprehensions are expressed that Prussia has ambitious projects under
                            her zeal for the enforcement of treaties, and that territorial
                            aggrandizement is among the dreams of Herr Von Bismarck.</p>
                        <p>The two nations have given assurances to the other great powers of
                            Europe, more or less positive, of their intention to restore the
                            territorial integrity of the Danish monarchy, after having established
                            the rights of the duchies to their union, and separate administration
                            upon a firm and lasting basis. Austria is believed to be in earnest in
                            this declaration; but to the Prussian statesman, motives and purposes
                            other than the declared ones are attributed. Besides his ambitious
                            designs to gain for Prussia a territory with important harbors, liberals
                            charge him with a desire to crush out the smaller states of Germany. The
                            attempt to take from the Diet and its army of execution the possession
                            of Holstein, and the quartering an army on the borders of Saxony, are
                            considered proofs positive of these intentions.</p>
                        <p>So far as the official declarations of the Prussian government go, up to
                            the present time, it means to restore, in due time, the duchies to
                            Denmark, on the terms that the union with Denmark shall only be a
                            personal rule of the King of Denmark, as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, the
                            duchies being united under a common administration of their own—a
                            relation similar to the one existing between Sweden and Norway. Less,
                            Prussia (so proclaims King William) will not accept, and not “until
                            having at least accomplished so much will he sheathe the sword he has
                            drawn.”</p>
                        <p>The difficulties and complications are increasing every day, and most of
                            the diplomatic representatives here are well-nigh convinced that the
                            approaching spring will see a European war.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The threatened invasion of the Danish
                            province of Jutland, mentioned in my last despatch, has taken place, and
                            the result was the occupation of the village of Kolding, immediately on
                            the boundary line. Report says that a part of the village is in
                            Schleswig. The advance was made by the Prussian troops. As soon as
                            knowledge of it reached Austria the proceeding was objected to. The
                            utterances of the other great powers, moreover, were so significant that
                            no further advance was made. No other military event of any importance
                            has occurred.</p>
                        <p>The ministerial conference of some of the smaller German powers which
                            assembled at Wurzburg separated without any decided action, saving their
                            evident disagreement or fear under some general resolve to stand by each
                            other and the authority of the Diet against any aggressions by the great
                            powers. The truth is, Prussia and Austria control the Diet. They usually
                            carry with them enough of the smaller states to accomplish what they may
                            desire. If the majority of the Diet ever place themselves upon the
                            record against the wishes of the two great powers, it is sure to be upon
                            a question that in solution will not cause serious disagreement.</p>
                        <p>England, with the consent of France and Russia, proposed to the allied
                            powers a conference with a view to a settlement of the question, and
                            pending the proceedings an armistice should be established. The allied
                            powers assented to that part of the proposition involving a conference,
                            but refused to entertain so much of it as demanded an armistice. To this
                            modification the other powers assented, and it only remains for Denmark
                            to agree to it, and thus remit the Danish Schleswig-Holstein question
                            again to its historical and traditional position, viz., the hands of
                            diplomats. Denmark will be compelled to join in that conference. It
                            cannot resist the combined will of the five great powers. What terms
                            will proceed from that conference can only be judged of in a degree from
                            the position already taken by some of these powers. England had made
                            desperate efforts to have Denmark withdraw the constitution, the effect
                            of which was to consolidate the duchies into the kingdom of Denmark as
                            an integral part. The King of Prussia has declared that he will not
                            sheathe the sword until the duchies are united under a separate
                            administration. Austria does not desire to separate them from Denmark
                            and allow the Prince of Augustenburg to be established as duke. From
                            present appearances, the conference will find the duchies completely
                            Germanized in its interior administration, as the evidences of Danish
                            rule are being set aside as rapidly as possible. The Danish language in
                            official and legal proceedings, and in church and school, has been
                            supplanted by the German, and Danish officials go into retirement with
                            their language. An old law of the duchies, requiring two years’ study at
                            the University of Kiel as a qualification of such official positions as
                            involve a collegiate education, has been revived, which act alone
                            vacates all the leading and important offices.</p>
                        <p>These proceedings will have been finished before the conference is ended,
                            and to all intents and purposes the duchies will be an independent
                            state, except on the sole question of who shall be the executive head.
                            The allied powers are opposed to the pretence of the Prince of
                            Augustenburg, and my conviction is that the Danish king will have rule
                            over the duchies, but he will not be allowed to undo what has been
                            accomplished by the occupation of Holstein and the invasion of
                            Schleswig. While his personal position will thus be preserved, it will
                            not add to the power of the kingdom of Denmark. A quasi independent
                            sovereignty annexed to the kingdom through a disputed succession,
                            foreign in its language and laws, hostile from a feeling of wrong and
                            oppression hereto-fore <pb facs="0231" n="207" xml:id="pg_207"/>
                            suffered, and conscious that the German nation is its protector, it will
                            be a constant source of strife and conflict and weakness to Denmark. The
                            duchies will be in the kingdom, but not of it.</p>
                        <p>Through the official papers of Copenhagen the Danish regulations for the
                            blockade of the German ports have been given to the public “in extenso.”
                            I beg leave to annex them as published in the German press. According to
                            these regulations a provisional embargo is to be laid, until the first
                            of April, upon all ships carrying an enemy’s flag anchored in the ports
                            or bays of Denmark. After that date such ships may be withdrawn with
                            safe conducts to non-blockaded ports, upon condition that the states to
                            which they belong will exercise reciprocity. As regards the blockade
                            itself it is said: “The blockade is to be held to have commenced when
                            one or several vessels blockade a port in such a manner that merchantmen
                            can neither enter nor issue without running evident risk of capture.
                            Commandants of ships charged with the blockade are immediately to summon
                            neutral vessels anchored in hostile ports to state when they will leave
                            the blockaded port.”</p>
                        <p>For the present, the blockade of the Holstein and Schleswig ports alone
                            is decreed; but it is intimated that the blockade of all German ports in
                            the Baltic and North sea is soon to follow.</p>
                        <p>The Paris declaration on the subject of privateering, &amp;c., will, in
                            general, be observed by Denmark.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The initiative in the spring campaign taken
                            in the southwest has tended to confirm European belief in the rapid
                            overthrow of the rebellion. General Sherman’s movement of his army corps
                            is exciting the admiration of military men here. We have telegraphic
                            news this morning that he has reached Selma. Johnson would seem to be in
                            a position to be “ground out” very soon between the upper and nether
                            millstone.</p>
                        <p>German diplomacy has been busier than their arms since my last despatch.
                            The conference proposed by England for the consideration of the Danish
                            question was acceded to by Prussia and Austria, but the consent carried
                            with it an equivalent to a negative in the condition attached, requiring
                            Denmark to surrender so much of Schleswig as it still possessed, viz:
                            the fortifications of Düppel and the island of Alsen.</p>
                        <p>Denmark has not yet replied to the proposition, and if the reply of that
                            government should follow the will of the people, as exhibited in the
                            late elections, that reply would be a refusal until the allies had
                            evacuated Schleswig.</p>
                        <p>The invasion of the Danish province of Jutland was suspended for some
                            days at the point first seized; during that time the diplomats have been
                            busy. The result is that the allies are again advancing, and, with some
                            fighting, have reached Frederica.</p>
                        <p>This movement is said not to have in view a permanent occupation of that
                            province, being only strategical, to compel the Danes to abandon the
                            fortifications of Düppel and the island of Alsen, by outflanking their
                            position. A direct attack from the front is regarded as doubtful in its
                            result, and even if successful, <pb facs="0232" n="208" xml:id="pg_208"
                            /> would be accompanied by such a loss of life that the allies prefer
                            the political complications growing out of the further occupation to the
                            sacrifice of their men.</p>
                        <p>Denmark has declared that from and after the 15th instant the following
                            Prussian ports will be blockaded, viz: Comin, Schwinemunde, Wolgart,
                            Greifswalde, Stralsund and Barth.</p>
                        <p>Danish cruisers have already seized a considerable amount of shipping
                            belonging to the different German states.</p>
                        <p>Prussia and Austria have not yet abandoned their attempt to control, on
                            behalf of Germany, this entire Schleswig-Holstein question. For the bold
                            movement of crowding out of Holstein the troops of the Bund, they have
                            substituted diplomacy in the Diet where their proposition to assume the
                            whole control is still undecided. I am prepared to see it adopted, as I
                            have a present conviction that nothing hostile to the views and wishes
                            of the allies will be undertaken by that body.</p>
                        <p>The German people in the beginning had some confidence that the Diet
                            would protect the German nationality in the duchies, even to the extent
                            of quarrelling with Prussia and Austria. They have been undeceived on
                            that point. The last effort of the Diet to rescue itself from the
                            powerless and insignificant state into which the action of the great
                            powers has thrown it, is a proposition to declare war against Denmark,
                            based upon the seizure of ships, blockade, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Such a declaration would only be a statement of the actual condition of
                            things, and if it sent into the field the troops of the Bund they will
                            be under the dictation and control of the allies. Every day makes more
                            and more clear the political “rope of sand” that binds Germany together.
                            In this respect the cause of German union has lost one of its crowned
                            champions in the sudden and unexpected death of the King of Bavaria,
                            Maximilian II, who died on the 10th instant, after one day’s illness; he
                            was greatly beloved by his people. He was believed to be sincerely
                            attached to the cause of constitutional government and German unity.
                            Bavaria being, next to Austria and Prussia, the largest of the German
                            states, it was to King Maximilian to whom the friends of the
                            independence of the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein chiefly looked for
                            help. His death is a serious blow to the waning hopes and prospects of
                            the Prince of Augustenburg.</p>
                        <p>King Maximilian is followed by King Ludwig II, his son, a youth not yet
                            nineteen years of age. The demise of the aged King of Wirtemberg is also
                            daily looked for.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatches, Nos. 66 and 67, dated, respectively, 9th and
                            12th of March ultimo.</p>
                        <p>A conference, diplomatic, for the solution of the difficulties in Denmark
                            and Schleswig-Holstein, has been assented to by Denmark, Prussia,
                            Austria, England, France, Russia, and Sweden. The German Diet has been
                            notified of this, and requested to send a representative. No conclusion
                            has yet been arrived at by that body upon the propositions.</p>
                        <pb facs="0233" n="209" xml:id="pg_209"/>
                        <p>The delegates, assenting to the agreement, are to meet in Sweden on the
                            12th instant. As no basis for the negotiations has been passed, and the
                            war is to continue pending the deliberations of the convention, a very
                            general impression here is, that no result will be reached, and some of
                            the members of the corps diplomatic do not believe that it will even
                            assemble.</p>
                        <p>Austria desires to get out of this complication upon almost any terms.
                            This disposition, and the failure as yet to get the Diet to adopt the
                            war on behalf of entire Germany, compels the Prussian government either
                            to assent to the conference, or find itself isolated in the war against
                            Denmark.</p>
                        <p>The military operations are now confined to the attack upon the
                            fortifications at Düppel, and appearances are that they can only be
                            taken by the slow operations of a regular siege. From all the
                            information that I can obtain, it will be found, as a defensive
                            position, almost a second Sebastopol. If Denmark had troops enough to
                            re-enforce the place as the exigencies of the defence place hors du
                            combat the present garrison; even the present numerical odds of four or
                            five allies to one Dane would not enable them to take the position. The
                            allies have been before it for some three or four weeks, and a Prussian
                            officer, just from the theatre of war, told me he thought it would
                            require two months more to reduce it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hon. Sir:</hi> In order to be prepared, should an
                            American vessel be under way for this port, which I have reason to
                            believe, I would pray for your kind instructions how to proceed in case
                            the vessel, in passing the sound, should be notified by the Danes that
                            Swinemünde is blockaded, and the captain therefore, perhaps, run into
                            some other port, not included in the so-called blockade, and desire to
                            discharge his cargo there.</p>
                        <pb facs="0234" n="210" xml:id="pg_210"/>
                        <p>The consignees here would, then, probably, as has been done in like eases
                            already, where vessels of neutrals were concerned, apply to me for
                            instructions to the captain of such vessel to proceed here, to which
                            place he has been chartered, as long as no “legal blockade” exists, and
                            up to this evening there has been “no actual presence of a blockading
                            force” at Swinemünde. A squadron of Danish vessels-of-war has been in
                            sight for an hour or so at different times—that is all; but the same has
                            not been “stationary, nor sufficiently near” at any time, so as to
                            effect a “valid blockade” of that port.</p>
                        <p>Should this state continue, I think, myself, no neutral vessel is bound
                            to respect either the notification from the Danish admiral, of which I
                            have had the honor to inform you, and which was sent in by a British
                            merchantman from a place in the open sea about fifty miles distant from
                            Swinemünde, nor the notices of the pretended blockade given by Danish
                            pilots to vessels passing the sound or the belts; but in order to be
                            sure, what to do when applied to, respectfully ask for your instructions
                            on the subject the earliest day possible, and the more so as my opinion
                            thereon is frequently asked by other foreign consuls here, and I am
                            somewhat uncertain as to (my way of reading) Wheaton being right or
                            not.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, yours sincerely obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hon. Sir:</hi>Yours, greatly esteemed, of the 2d
                            instant, I have had the honor to receive, and in regard to the notified
                            blockade, by Danish vessels of-war, of the six seaports in this consular
                            district, of which I had the honor to report under the 29th of last
                            month, I now beg to state, in addition, that it is being generally
                            considered here that no such blockade as notified by the Danish
                            government under the 12th, and again by the commander of the Danish
                            squadron somewhere in the Baltic, under the 18th of same month, has at
                            any time, up to this present, ever existed <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto.</hi></p>
                        <p>In support of this opinion, which, as stated in my last, is also
                            cherished by most of the consuls of the neutral powers residing at this
                            place, the enclosed exposé has been gotten up here for circulation in
                            Great Britain, and which, as I feel bound to admit, gives the nature of
                            the case exactly as it exists, leaving the arguments therein contained
                            at what they are worth, and to be considered separately.</p>
                        <p>The greatest strength of the notified blockade has hitherto been in the
                            notification itself, and in the fact also of the Danes commanding the
                            sound and the belts, where every neutral vessel passing is being
                            officially notified that the ports named are blockaded, and the captains
                            believing therein, in order to avoid supposed dangers, run into some
                            other port, not among the pretendingly blockaded, to discharge or
                            dispose of their cargoes.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the irregularity in notifying the consuls of the neutral
                            powers of the blockade, the matter stands thus: When, after the naval
                            engagement on the 17th of March, the Prussians returned to Swinemünde,
                            and the Danes to Möen, a British merchantman fell in with the Danish
                            squadron when at sea, and was induced to appear on board the flag-ship
                            Szalland, where he received a permit to proceed on his voyage to
                            Stettin, and at the same time Contre Admiral von Dockum handed him six
                            sealed letters for delivery when in port, <pb facs="0235" n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211"/> addressed to the consuls of the neutral powers,
                            namely, one letter in common to all the consuls in each of the places to
                            be blockaded. This was on the 18th, and on the 20th the British captain
                            arrived at Swinemünde, where he very innocently delivered said letters
                            to an officer of the Prussian government, who saw fit to forward the
                            same to the minister of foreign affairs at Berlin.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th the British consul here received a despatch from his
                            ambassador at Berlin, with these same letters enclosed, which, having
                            been sent to him unopened from the ministry of foreign affairs, he now
                            directed Consul Black-well here to open, and communicate their contents
                            to the other consuls, who all reside here, and which was accordingly
                            done by sending the documents around for copying. After which they were
                            returned again to the British consul. The notifications were all of the
                            same tenor, excepting the name only of the different places to which
                            addressed; were worded in French; dated Bay of Stettin, March 18, 1864,
                            and signed C. von Dockum, contre admiral. A translation thereof will be
                            found in the exposé, and, if required, I will send you a copy of the
                            original.</p>
                        <p>The exposé contains all that I could at present report regarding the
                            intended blockade, and its effect upon the minds here, wherefore I take
                            the liberty to send you the same; and awaiting your instructions as
                            requested,</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be your sincerely obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir:</hi>Your favors of the 2d and 4th instant
                            are at hand. It seems to me that the question of the sufficiency or
                            insufficiency of the blockade of Swinemünde should not be anticipated by
                            you in advance of any demand for your official action.</p>
                        <p>I have seen in the newspapers that the government of the United States
                            has been officially notified of the intention of the Danish government
                            to establish a blockade, and it has, by proclamation, brought that
                            notice to the attention of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>You have also received a notice to the same purport; the regularity and
                            effect of that notice may or may not hereafter become the subject for
                            serious discussion under the rules prescribed by Denmark for the conduct
                            of its officers.</p>
                        <p>You also advise me that the Danish pilots in the sound or belts are
                            notifying all vessels of the blockade.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that enough has been done to show clearly and distinctly
                            what the Danish government mean, and the next step on their part is to
                            carry such instructions into effect in accordance with the law of
                            nations, which requires an “effective blockade.”</p>
                        <p>The United States government is not a party to the Paris treaty, for the
                            reason that greater freedom of the seas was demanded upon its side than
                            was provided for in the stipulations of that treaty.</p>
                        <p>The question, under the circumstances, becomes one of fact, to be
                            determined upon the evidence submitted to the prize court before which
                            condemnation is sought against any vessel charged with breaking or
                            attempting to break the blockade. We have claimed for our courts full
                            jurisdiction and authority to pass upon these questions, and demanded
                            that the adjudications should be <pb facs="0236" n="212" xml:id="pg_212"
                            /> respected. Our government will concede the same authority to the
                            courts of other nations, and respect all decisions made in good faith
                            and according to law. While so doing it will not neglect to look after
                            the interest of vessel owners, not only upon the question of law, but as
                            to the facts.</p>
                        <p>For you to anticipate the questions thus to be determined, and in advance
                            declare the “blockade ineffective,” before the occurrence of any case
                            calling for your official action, and especially to undertake to
                            instruct the master of a vessel or the consignee of a cargo that they
                            can with safety run into the port of Swinemünde, now claimed to be
                            blockaded, would be assuming a responsibility that you are not called
                            upon to assume. These parties must take upon themselves the
                            responsibility of the conduct of the vessel, and your duty is to aid
                            them all in your power, if they become involved in difficulties. To that
                            end all information as to the condition of the blockading force,
                            &amp;c., &amp;c., should be carefully preserved, so as to be made
                            available, but no act or advice of yours should lead them into
                            experiments.</p>
                        <p>While I should have a very decided opinion, if all the facts are shown in
                            the circular that accompanied your letters, I certainly should not utter
                            that opinion in advance, in such a manner as to induce the parties
                            interested to violate what is claimed by Denmark to be an effective
                            blockade.</p>
                        <p>I have had an interview at the ministry of foreign affairs upon this
                            subject, and although the insufficiency of the blockade is there
                            claimed, and notwithstanding the official notice to that effect given by
                            the Prussian government, they were very desirous that I should
                            understand that the government assumed none of the responsibility which
                            neutral vessels might incur in running into Swinemünde.</p>
                        <p>You say you have laid all the facts before the State Department. The
                            Secretary’s proverbial promptness, and his habit of elaboration, will
                            give you, at the earliest day, complete and full instruction.</p>
                        <p>As our government has been enforcing a blockade for a long time, its
                            attitude is such as forbids its representatives from assuming any
                            doubtful position upon such questions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatches Nos. 69 and 70, dated 19th
                            and 21st of March, respectively, as also circular 48, bearing date 6th
                            February, are received.</p>
                        <p>The Prussian portion of the allied army are still in front of the
                            fortifications at Düppel, making their approaches according to the best
                            approved principles of modern warfare. The bombardment is described as
                            terrific. The hopeful are promising themselves daily news of the
                            storming of the fortifications. As yet the digging and firing, in which
                            they have been engaged for nearly two months, continues.</p>
                        <p>The London conference, which is now a fixed fact, and was to have
                            assembled on the 12th instant, is postponed to the 20th. The cause for
                            the postponement, as alleged, was the inability of the German Diet to
                            act upon the proposition made to it in time to send a
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>The Diet has now acted and Her Von Benst, the prime minister of Saxony,
                            will represent it at the London conference.</p>
                        <p>That assemblage will be a mere representation of dynastic interests, and
                            if any <pb facs="0237" n="213" xml:id="pg_213"/> concession is made to
                            the will of the people of Schleswig-Holstein it will be because the
                            German rulers fear the result among their own people in the event of the
                            restoration of the duchies to Denmark. Those interested may concede that
                            much because they can do it at the expense of a small kingdom. If it is
                            done, it will be contrary to all the principles of the men and the party
                            who now control Prussian affairs, and it will be a concession from
                            necessity to the popular will in Germany and in the duchies. The
                            invasion of Schleswig was, in reality, an attempt to stifle the popular
                            opinion of Germany as it was being developed in connexion with the
                            affairs of the duchies. Events have been stronger than the will of the
                            ruling statesmen, and Herr Von Bismarck must yield on that point.</p>
                        <p>The conference may postpone what dynastic rulers think the evil day and
                            preserve for the present the peace of Europe; but there is no mistaking
                            the fact that Europe is arrayed in two vast hostile forces, only abiding
                            their time for the final struggle. It is dynastic Europe, in possession
                            of the governments, controlling armies and treasures, against liberal
                            Europe, sometimes called democratic and revolutionary, of which
                            Garibaldi is a fair type and representative. This antagonism exists in
                            nearly all of the kingdoms, and the knowledge of its existence, and of
                            the fact that a general war would develop its power, is the real reason
                            for the strenuous efforts which are being made to preserve the
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>The ovation given by the people of England to Garibaldi is a subject of
                            comment in all the governmental circles in Europe, and in spite of the
                            efforts to deny its political importance, it is causing new and
                            additional agitation and raising the hopes of the liberals. The
                            governing classes of Europe look upon this movement unfavorably, and, so
                            far as any prominent statesman has taken part in the festivities, it was
                            from compulsion and in obedience to a popular demand too powerful to be
                            resisted, and too much in earnest to be thwarted with safety. The tories
                            of England, at the beck of the Emperor of France, drove from office the
                            friend of Mazzini because of his friendship for that individual; but the
                            people of England have given to Garibaldi, also a friend to Mazzini, an
                            ovation such as was never meted to a crowned head on that island.</p>
                        <p>The new empire of Mexico is established, so far as it can be done on this
                            side of the ocean. Maximilian has accepted the crown and assumed all the
                            trappings of royalty. He has organized his imperial official household,
                            appointed diplomatic representatives to the leading European courts, and
                            sailed from Trieste in an Austrian armed ship, accompanied by French
                            ships, and will call at Rome for a blessing on his way to his fancied
                            empire.</p>
                        <p>The new Mexican loan has enabled Maximilian to pay his debts—he was
                            hopelessly insolvent—has given him, in addition, a few millions of
                            francs for travelling expenses, and put in the French exchequer the
                            balance to pay past liabilities and guarantee future responsibilities.*

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch No. 71 dated April 5, 1864.</p>
                        <p>The fierce bombardment of the fortifications at Düppel, as described in
                            my last, was continued until the morning of the 18th instant. At five
                            o’clock in the morning on that day the Prussian troops mounted the
                            trenches, and at ten <pb facs="0238" n="214" xml:id="pg_214"/> the
                            signal for storming the works was given; in about two hours and a half
                            all the ten forts were taken, and very soon thereafter the “tete de
                            pont,” which protected the bridge connecting Düppel with the island of
                            Alsen, was also carried. The Danes destroyed the bridge to prevent the
                            Prussians from crossing to the island, thus cutting off the retreat of a
                            considerable portion of the corps that had been defending the
                            fortifications. The Danes lost nearly one hundred officers, and perhaps
                            two thousand prisoners and all of the artillery in the
                            fortifications.</p>
                        <p>The Prussians report their loss at two generals, sixty officers, and six
                            hundred men killed and wounded.</p>
                        <p>The shores of the island of Alsen are lined with Danish batteries whose
                            effectiveness depends entirely upon the condition of the troops. My
                            impression is that they will find themselves too much exhausted to
                            prevent the crossing and further advance of the Prussians, elated as
                            they are with their present victory. Berlin was very much excited over
                            the result and was illuminated. The people gathered around the King’s
                            palace shouting, cheering, and singing, and his Majesty appeared on the
                            balcony and saluted the people.</p>
                        <p>The ministerial papers announce the intention to fully occupy the
                            province of Jutland and to hold it as security for the injury done to
                            German commerce by the Danes.</p>
                        <p>The conference assembles on the 25th instant at London, and in the
                            present excited state of both Danes and Prussians, it seems as though it
                            would be an impossibility to obtain even a cessation of hostilities
                            during the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor of France holds the key to all these difficulties; armed to
                            the teeth, his will is to-day law to all Europe, excepting Russia. What
                            he means no one seems to understand, but he has sent a personal telegram
                            to the King of Prussia congratulating him on the success of the Prussian
                            troops before Düppel. To-morrow evening the King goes himself to the
                            army in Schleswig to congratulate it and bestow his favors and
                            decorations.</p>

                        <p>The allied armies now possess all of Jutland, so far as any military
                            forces occupy the same, the Danes having abandoned the fortifications at
                            Frederica, which have been occupied by the allies. The Danes have also
                            abandoned all of the mainland of the province of Jutland.</p>
                        <p>The work at the London conference goes on very slowly. The representative
                            at London can give earlier and more exact information as to the real
                            position of affairs in that conference than I can from this point.</p>
                        <p>The proposition for an armistice in the form proposed by England and
                            France has been rejected by Prussia and Austria. The position of those
                            governments on the subject of an armistice is as follows: They demand an
                            abandonment of the blockade of the German harbors, the surrender of the
                            prizes captured, and <pb facs="0239" n="215" xml:id="pg_215"/> the
                            evacuation and surrender of the island of Alsen, which is a port of
                            Schleswig, upon which terms they, on their part, seem disposed to agree
                            to the evacuation of Jutland by their forces and an armistice.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>To-day the telegraph brings reports that
                            the London conference has arranged for a cessation of the hostilities
                            between Denmark and Germany, for the term of four weeks, commencing on
                            the 1st instant, on the basis of the “Uti possedetis,” so far as the
                            present position of the hostile armies is concerned, and Denmark, in
                            addition, to raise the blockade of such ports as are now blockaded.</p>
                        <p>The telegraph also brings the news of a naval battle between some Danish
                            ships and a portion of the combined Austrian and Prussian squadron, near
                            the island of Heligoland. As yet we have not enough of detail to
                            determine who has a right to claim the victory. The reports tell of
                            about one hundred and seventy killed and wounded on the side of the
                            allies, and severe injuries to some of the ships. Most, if not all, of
                            this has been suffered by the Austrian portion of the squadron. There is
                            no report from the Danish, beyond the allegation that they have achieved
                            a victory, have received some injury, and sailed northward.</p>
                        <p>My conviction is that the conference cannot restore the duchies to
                            Denmark as an integral part of that kingdom. It may give the King of
                            Denmark personal rule, and through that create a “personal union;” but
                            matters have gone so far, that even that is not probable. The
                            maintenance of peace under such a union is impossible. The conviction is
                            so strong among the people of the duchies that the present is the time
                            to free themselves from Danish rule forever, that force only can keep
                            them from rebellion against such an arrangement as will prevent the
                            accomplishment of their purposes, and such a force must come from the
                            great powers of Europe. The Danish military power is broken—its war
                            material largely captured, (among it four hundred pieces of cannon,) its
                            fortifications, some of which have stood for centuries, levelled to the
                            ground, and its loss in killed and wounded very large. The Danes are a
                            free, martial people, who have resisted bravely, and step by step, the
                            advance of overwhelming numbers, and although, unaided by other nations,
                            the position was desperate from the beginning, they have struggled with
                            a bravery and obstinacy that must be admired. Denmark proper has a
                            population of a little more than a million and half, and it cannot alone
                            govern the duchies against their will, as the power of the duchies is
                            not to be measured alone by their population. A contest will call to
                            their aid volunteers from all Germany, and no one, not among the
                            Germans, can appreciate the depth of feeling upon the question
                            throughout Germany. It is useless to speculate about who will rule the
                            duchies hereafter. It is not believed here that the London conference
                            will settle that question. The prime minister of Prussia is said to have
                            ambitious views territorially, but such views are believed not to
                            correspond with the feelings of the king. If the question should be left
                            to the people of the duchies, the Duke of Augustenburg would be their
                            choice. A dissolution of the London conference without a definite <pb
                                facs="0240" n="216" xml:id="pg_216"/> settlement of the question,
                            and the continuance of the war, or even the continued occupation and
                            administration of the duchies by the allies, might pave the way for the
                            prime minister’s ambition. I think he hopes to have circumstances and
                            events do for him what could not be accomplished by an open
                            announcement. Such an announcement would call upon all the great powers
                            to take an active part in the question.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, one of the objects expected from this war on Denmark has
                            been accomplished. The attention of the great mass of the people of
                            Prussia has been drawn away from the internal politics and affairs of
                            the kingdom, and military glory and success have made them forget, in
                            the enthusiasm of the moment, that they practically ceased to be a
                            constitutionally-ruled kingdom. Military influence and control will now
                            have undoubted sway in this kingdom.</p>

                        <p>The London conference which had, at its last meeting, adjourned for two
                            weeks, reassembles to-day. If we can rely upon the quasi official
                            intimations put forth for the last few days in the journals supposed to
                            represent the views of several of the leading powers, and upon the
                            general opinion now expressed by all members of the diplomatic corps in
                            Berlin, the adjournment has not been fruitless. According to these
                            intimations all the great powers are united upon the proposition to
                            place the Duke of Augustenburg upon the throne of Schleswig-Holstein;
                            Schleswig to be divided in such a manner as shall give its German
                            population to the new state, and Its Danish population to Denmark, as an
                            integral part of its kingdom, freed from all control of the German Bund.
                            That arrangement was suggested, and the idea fiercely rejected by
                            Denmark before the commencement of hostilities. It is now tolerated in
                            Copenhagen in the newspapers, and claimed to be far preferable to any
                            personal union, as such personal union would permit the internal affairs
                            of the kingdom to be meddled with by the German Bund.</p>
                        <p>The friendship of England has been the bane of Denmark. Expecting
                            material aid in the event of a struggle with the German powers, Denmark
                            felt bound to yield to the advice of that power, and concession after
                            concession was made under that advice, such concessions only partially
                            meeting the demands of Germany; and, finally, when war came, there was
                            no aid to be obtained, and It is reported that the counsellor, adviser,
                            and friend is to make the proposition to divide its kingdom. Denmark
                            could have made all these terms, and even more favorable ones, by direct
                            negotiations with the German powers before the commencement of
                            hostilities; but, deceived by false hopes, it resisted, and has now
                            nothing to show for the horrors and losses of war but a divided
                            kingdom.</p>

                        <p>I assume that there will be peace as the result of this conference.
                            Denmark has realized her helplessness and want of friends willing to
                            risk a war on her account, and now consents to the division of the
                            kingdom. The German powers having taken from Denmark Lauenburg and
                            Holstein, are willing to assent to the division of Schleswig, only
                            debating over the line. Another division of a country by treaty
                            stipulations and in the interests of dynasties is to be made, and a new
                            govermental dukedom, by the grace of the powerful, is to be established
                            for Frederick of Augustenburg; and although I believe he is the choice
                            of that people, the statesmen of the Austrian and Bismarck school do not
                            wish so far to recognize the principle of democracy as to consult, even
                                “<hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi>” the people.</p>
                        <p>The position to-day is that the German powers will not consent to the
                            division of Schleswig upon the line of the river Schlei, as proposed by
                            England, and rather than adopt it will resume the war. They insist on
                            the line of Tondem-Apemade; or, at the utmost, they are willing to yield
                            to the line of Ton-dem-Flensborg, and they have formally notified that
                            unless a basis is agreed upon within the fourteen days, viz., by the
                            26th of June, hostilities will be renewed.</p>
                        <p>As the differences in the conference only involve the interests of little
                            helpless Denmark, and the wishes and desires of the people of Schleswig,
                            I do not believe such obstacles will stand in the way of a
                            settlement.</p>

                        <p>The direction in relation to Baron Von Gerolt shall be fully observed
                            to-day, when I make my departure visit to the ministry. The chief Yon
                            Bismarck is absent with the King at Carlsbad, and the under-secretary of
                            state, Mr. Von Thile, receives.</p>
                        <pb facs="0242" n="218" xml:id="pg_218"/>
                        <p>At the close of England’s abortive attempt to keep the peace, by
                            constantly showing that she could not be driven into a contest, the war
                            was renewed, and the allies, in overpowering numbers, crowded to the
                            island of Alsen, defeated the Danes with great loss, and now possess the
                            entire territory that is claimed as a part of the duchy of
                            Schleswig.</p>
                        <p>The Danish province of Jutland is likewise substantially in the
                            possession of the allies, and it is said that they intend to levy
                            contributions to meet the losses sustained by the German states on the
                            ocean.</p>
                        <p>The disposition of the duchies of Lauenburg, Holstein, and Schleswig, is
                            now the agitated question. The people thereof, so far as they are
                            German, demand the Duke of Augustenburg for their ruler. Austria and
                            Prussia to-day, apparently in full accord, would consent to that if the
                            duke would agree to the conditions they desire, viz: that Kiel shall
                            become a federal harbor, and Rendsburg a federal fortress, occupied by
                            the troops of the Bund, and that the troops of the duchies shall be
                            incorporated into the army of Prussia; or, in other words, the duke can
                            have the powers of a viceroy, if he will consent. The question of the
                            succession is to be decided by the Diet, and Prussia and Austria, in
                            accord, may delay that decision to suit their own designs and purposes;
                            in the mean time remaining in the occupation of and administering the
                            duchies. Without the concessions that I have mentioned, Herr Von
                            Bismarck does not intend to set up a government in the duchies until
                            absolutely compelled to do so. Where the influence is to come from that
                            will induce or compel him to yield possession is not apparent now.</p>
                        <p>The rumors about an alliance entered into by the sovereigns of the three
                            great northern powers at their late interview, continue, although
                            semi-official journals here and in Vienna have contradicted them.</p>

                        <p>Since the capture of the island of Alsen by the Prussians, no news of any
                            importance has been received from the seat of war. This, to a large
                            extent, is the result of the stringent measures the government has taken
                            to keep all military and naval operations from becoming known, by
                            publications and descriptions thereof, before they are executed. Neither
                            the telegraph nor the public journals are permitted to give information
                            on the subject, and the public learns nothing, except what is given them
                            through short official bulletins which appear daily in the
                            “Staanzeiger,” the “Moniteur” of Prussia. Operations looking to the
                            capture of the island of Funen are progressing, and it is clear that the
                            Danes are no longer in a condition to offer any material resistance to
                            the German powers. Even at Copenhagen this conviction seems now
                            prevailing, and it is this which has induced King Christian to dismiss
                            the Mourad ministry identified with the incorporation of Schleswig into
                            Denmark, and the war, and to intrust Count Charles Moltke with the
                            formation of a new ministry. The <pb facs="0243" n="219" xml:id="pg_219"
                            /> selection of Count Moltke is a demonstration at once in behalf of
                            peace, and against parliamentary government, he being a stout
                            absolutist. It is this latter quality which recommends him to King
                            William of Prussia, and his prime minister Herr Von Bismarck; and hence
                            the ministerial change is hailed with great delight by the ministerial
                            journals here. I believe his appointment comes too late. He will not be
                            able to preserve the integrity of the Danish monarchy as it exsisted
                            before the war. A final and total separation of the duchies from
                            Denmark, and their reunion under a government and dynasty of their own
                            will alone secure permanent peace. It is true there is some question as
                            to whether the Duke of Augustenburg, or the Duke of Oldenburg is to
                            become the ruler of the new state; but as the people in the duchies are
                            for the former, he will most likely be recognized by the federal Diet,
                            even against the wishes of Prussia who favors the latter. King William
                            is still at Carlsbad. From there, on the 18th instant, he will proceed
                            to Gastein to continue his cure; later in the summer, he will pass some
                            weeks at Baden-Baden. Herr Yon Bismarck remains with him during all his
                            absence from Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Of the three vessels that was building at Bordeaux for the rebels, and
                            which, with the consent of the French government, have been acquired by
                            Prussia, one has already arrived at Bremerhafen. Her name was changed
                            from “Yedo” to “Augusta,” and she is now duly commissioned and armed and
                            equipped as one of his Prussian Majesty’s steam corvettes. This is the
                            same vessel that, when the ship left Bordeaux, was believed to be
                            destined, under the pirate Semmes, to become “Alabama No. 2.” Now that
                            the truth of her destination has become known, French and English
                            sympathizers with rebel piracy are greatly chagrined. The two remaining
                            vessels are to be delivered to Prussia so soon as completed. Besides
                            these purchases, there is reason to believe the Prussian government has
                            attempted to effect others in the United States, through Dr. Schleiden,
                            the minister of the Hanseatic towns, in Washington. If any vessels have
                            been bought in America for Bremen and Hamburg, the real party in the
                            bargain are not they, but Prussia.</p>

                            on behalf of the minister of foreign affairs, desires me to express to
                            you the gratification of his government at the flattering terms in which
                            you have alluded to the high esteem and respect in which his Prussian
                            Majesty’s minister at Washington, Baron Yon Gerolt, is held, not only by
                            the President, but by the people of the United States. The baron has
                            arrived in Europe, by the steamer Hansa, but has not yet visited Berlin.
                            When he does so, I shall not fail to wait upon him and offer him my
                            services and attention to any extent he may feel pleased to accept
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Herr Von Bismarck is still absent from Berlin; but while his sovereign,
                            King William, has proceeded to Gastein, in the Tyrol, he has gone to
                            Vienna to attend in person the conference now held there between Austria
                            and Prussia and Denmark, <pb facs="0244" n="220" xml:id="pg_220"/> to
                            settle the preliminaries and agree upon terms of peace. Hostilities were
                            suspended, and the blockade of the Prussian ports raised on the 20th
                            instant, to continue until the end of the month, by which time it is
                            expected that arrangements will have been made between Herr Von
                            Bismarck, Count Rechberg, and the Danish representative, Herr Von
                            Quaade, for an armistice, with an accepted basis for peace. So far as
                            Prussia is concerned, Herr Von Bismarck will agree to nothing short of a
                            total and absolute surrender of the three duchies, Schleswig, Holstein,
                            and Lauenburg, by the Danish crown; and there is no doubt that Austria
                            will sustain that demand. Moreover, Prussia and Austria will allow the
                            federal Diet no share or participation in arranging the terms and
                            concluding peace. The duchies must be surrendered to them; and they will
                            remain in Schleswig until the question as to who shall be designated as
                            ruler shall have been settled to their satisfaction. And so it may yet
                            appear that it was much easier to conquer and defeat Denmark than to
                            agree upon a final disposition of the conquered territory among
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The public journals here lately reported that two confederate officers,
                            by special permission of the King, were at the Prussian headquarters in
                            Jutland, where they were receiving great attention. I took upon myself
                            to make inquiries into the truth of the report at the Foreign Office,
                            and ascertained that it was not so. The following broad denial has
                            appeared in the official Staats Anzeiger:</p>
                        <p>“The Vossiche Zeitung, of the 12th instant, reports from Flensburg, July
                            10, that two officers of the confederate army were staying at the
                            headquarters of the allies at Apemade by permission of his Majesty the
                            King. This report is entirely unfounded. No officers of that army have
                            arrived there. Nor could an application for permission to remain at the
                            headquarters of the allies have received his Majesty’s assent, since the
                            confederate governments of the North American Union have not been
                            recognized by Prussia as independent states.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The suspension of hostilities between the
                            German powers and Denmark, which was to have terminated on the 31st
                            instant, has been extended until the 3d of August next. The Danish
                            plenipotentiaries are reported to have still insisted on a division of
                            Schleswig, and but for this extension the Vienna conference, like that
                            of London, would have ended in failure. Prussia very reluctantly
                            consented to the postponement, and the King of Denmark must yield to
                            Herr Von Bismarck’s terms, or else the war after August 3 will break out
                            anew.</p>
                        <p>Some excesses between Saxon and Hanoverian soldiers on the one side, and
                            Prussian on the other, having occurred at Rendsburg, orders were given
                            by the Prussian commander-in-chief for a brigade of Prussians, 6,000
                            strong, to occupy that place. The federal commander, to avoid a conflict
                            and bloodshed, withdrew his troops under protest, and so the Prussians
                            remain in possession of the key to the entire duchy of Holstein. Of
                            course, this coup de main has created great excitement in all the
                            smaller states of Germany, and the feeling of hostility towards Prussia
                            is intense. Austria, too, seems to have disapproved of this proceeding
                            of her ally, from the fact that Herr Von Bismarck has caused <pb
                                facs="0245" n="221" xml:id="pg_221"/> the Prussian minister at the
                            Frankfort Diet, which body likewise had issued a protest, to declare
                            that the occupation was a purely military measure, which by no means
                            involved a withdrawal of the troops of the federal execution; and this
                            being so, that there were no good reasons why these troops should not
                            return. It is likely that the affair will be compromised, but the end of
                            difficulties is by no means yet.</p>
                        <p>The under secretary of state of the Foreign Office, Herr Von Thile, has
                            received leave of absence, and his place has been assumed by Herr Von
                            Balan, late Prussian minister at Copenhagen and delegate to the London
                            conference. The King will be absent from Berlin until the end of August,
                            and before returning will proceed to Vienna, to pay a visit to the
                            Emperor of Austria. All the “chefs,” too, of the various foreign
                            missions here are now absent.</p>
                        <p>Late events at home have given occasion to Herr Von Bismarck’s
                            semi-official organ, “The Nord Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,” to display
                            great sympathy and partiality for the rebel cause, and in its zealous
                            wishes for the downfall of republican government, and the further
                            establishment of monarchical institutions on the American continent, it
                            indulges in the grossest misrepresentations regarding our armies and
                            finances. I have so far refrained from making any reclamations at the
                            ministry of foreign affairs against its infamous and slanderous course,
                            but I deem it my duty to take notice of and communicate the facts to
                            you. The relations of the journal in question to Herr Von Bismarck are
                            such that I feel quite justified in believing that in these aspersions
                            to our cause it reflects his sentiments. I await your directions whether
                            or not, in case of a continuance, I am to bring the matter to the notice
                            of the Foreign Office and ask for explanations.</p>
                        <p>A grossly false statement, with the view of discouraging emigration,
                            concerning the bill then pending in Congress, on the subject of
                            encouraging immigration, having appeared in a German illustrated paper
                            of immense circulation, published at Leipsig, to the effect that the
                            measure proposed by you was but a recruiting contrivance, and coupling
                            with this falsehood others as to our taxes and national debt, I sent the
                            article to Mr. Mothershead, our consul, requesting him to cause the
                            editor of that paper to correct his misstatements. Mr. Mothers head
                            promptly did so, and the correction was published. I have also made
                            arrangements that all such papers as copied the original article shall
                            print the correction. In connexion with this subject, I beg you will
                            cause a number of copies of the act encouraging immigration, as finally
                            passed, to be forwarded to this legation as early as convenient. I will
                            translate it into German and get it inserted in as many journals as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Another of the three vessels built at Bordeaux for the insurgents, but
                            now transferred to Prussia, the Victoria, a steam corvette, the mate to
                            the Augusta, late Yedo, has been completed, and her speedy arrival at
                            Cuxhafen, Hamburg, where she is to receive her armament and crew, is
                            looked for by the Prussian <pb facs="0246" n="222" xml:id="pg_222"/>
                            authorities. The third, a steam frigate of powerful dimensions, I am
                            informed, will likewise soon be completed, and will constitute the pride
                            of the Prussian navy. I will duly advise you when she shall have been
                            delivered, by Mr. Armann, the builder, to the Prussian government.</p>
                        <p>The Schleswig-Holstein question, since the close of the Vienna
                            conference, where the preliminaries of peace were settled, continues the
                            topic of interest in diplomatic and political circles. The actual
                            meeting of the plenipotentiaries to arrange the terms of a final peace
                            has not yet taken place, but is expected to occur this week. Herr Von
                            Bismarck, who desires to add to the triumph he has so far achieved the
                            greatest of all, that of transferring the whole or part of the duchies
                            to Prussia, is manifestly endeavoring to delay and postpone a final
                            settlement of the question of succession. Meanwhile the minor German
                            states are clamorous against Prussian aggression and the like; but as
                            long as Austria follows the lead of Herr Von Bismarck their outcries
                            will avail them nothing. It is expected, however, that during the visit
                            of King William at Vienna, where he arrived on Saturday and remains
                            until to-day, an intermistic government of the duchies will be arranged
                            in the shape of a board of commissioners, one from Prussia, one from
                            Austria, and, as a concession and peace-offering to the smaller states,
                            one from the federal Diet. As yet nothing has transpired as to the
                            result of the interview of the two sovereigns. Herr Von Bismarck, of
                            course, is with the King at Vienna, and will from there accompany him to
                            Baden-Baden, where he goes before returning here to pay a visit to the
                            Queen. Present arrangements fix the King’s return for the first week in
                            September.</p>

                            for the rebels; 4 screw avisos; 19 gunboats, 5 of them of 100
                            horse-power, and 3 guns each, and the remainder of 80 horse-power, and 2
                            guns each; and 1 turret ship, ordered in England, but not yet
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>King William has left Vienna, and has proceeded to pay a visit to the
                            King of Bavaria. What arrangements, if any, regarding the duchies, have
                            been determined on between their Prussian and Austrian Majesties, have
                            not yet transpired. <pb facs="0247" n="223" xml:id="pg_223"/>
                            Semi-official organs, both here and at Vienna, intimate that a perfect
                            and satisfactory understanding was arrived at. It is believed that the
                            chances of the Duke of Oldenburg to the succession in Schleswig-Holstein
                            are improving. In that event, and most probably in any event, Lauenburg
                            will go to Prussia.</p>
                        <p>The sittings of the plenipotentiaries to arrange and settle the details
                            of the treaty of peace, at Vienna, have commenced. Their labors will not
                            speedily terminate. The settlement of the question of boundary and
                            finance will prove a matter of great difficulty. Meanwhile Prussia is
                            greatly reducing her force in the duchies. In the early part of
                            September Prince Frederick Charles, commander-in-chief of the allied
                            armies, will return to Berlin with the regiments of guards, amounting to
                            about 12,000 men, and his arrival is to be made the occasion for a grand
                            pageant and display. * * * *</p>

                            receipt of your despatches Nos. 13 and 14, dated August 12 and 20, 1864,
                            respectively. Your directions regarding the language of ministerial
                            organs towards the United States are duly noted.</p>
                        <p>In politics here everything is quiet, but the question of
                            re-establishment of the German Zollverein on the basis of the treaty
                            entered into with France, and the future commercial relations of Austria
                            towards the Zollverein thus reconstituted, largely occupy the public. I
                            intend to furnish the department, for publication in the annual volume
                            on the commercial relations of the United States, a full and detailed
                            account of all these questions, together with a statement of the
                            commerce of Prussia, and the state of the Zollverein, as well as of the
                            new tariff adopted, and hence refrain from enlarging upon the matter
                            here.</p>
                        <p>The peace conference at Vienna makes slow progress, and apprehensions
                            lest it separate without result are arising. I deem them unfounded.
                            Denmark, weakened and forsaken by France and England, is at the mercy of
                            her two conquerors, and must do their biddings. * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The affairs of the legation during my
                            absence for the summer have been conducted by Mr. Kreismann with his
                            usual care, promptness, and ability.</p>
                        <p>Baron Gerolt has been in Berlin for the last ten days. His enthusiasm for
                            our cause, his thorough knowledge of our public affairs, and of the
                            origin of <pb facs="0248" n="224" xml:id="pg_224"/> the rebellion,
                            together with his firm conviction of the ultimate triumph of the
                            government, have had a most favorable and beneficial influence in
                            government circles here. His position has enabled him to talk freely to
                            the king, queen, and crown prince, as well as to the circles, mostly
                            military, that surround them. His influence, however, has not been
                            confined to that circle, but has reached other influential personages. I
                            feel that the baron is entitled to our earnest thanks for his
                            earnestness and untiring zeal in presenting the facts connected with our
                            struggle, and the conviction which he has impressed upon others of the
                            ultimate and not far distant triumph of the cause of the government.</p>
                        <p>The campaign of the past summer shows conclusively that the end of the
                            rebellion is visible, and your advice to the people at Auburn, “to have
                            their souls in patience,” embraces the whole philosophy of the position,
                            and, if acted upon, will relieve the government of the pressure of
                            increasing impatience. The brilliant termination of Sherman’s long and
                            arduous campaign, the old admiral lashed to the topmast, fighting his
                            splendid battles at Mobile, and Grant’s almost daily pounding of Lee,
                            ought to satisfy the most unreasoning; and my belief is, that you have
                            passed the lowest ebb, both in military events and of the public
                            depression; and that the only harbor of safety—a complete and undivided
                            Union—is before you.</p>
                        <p>The peace negotiation between the allies and Denmark “drags its slow
                            length along”—a situation which quite pleases Herr Von Bismarck, always
                            provided there is no final rupture between Prussia and Austria. Bismarck
                            expects to acquire title; and if not title, at any rate a strong
                            interest in the duchies by occupation. The people of the duchies feel
                            to-day that they have changed “king log for king stork.” They are
                            allowed no more voice in the settlement of their own fate and destiny
                            than any other conquered country is allowed. This may change, but at
                            present such is their position.</p>
                        <p>King William again leaves Berlin to-day to be present at the queen’s
                            birthday, at Baden-Baden. He will be absent ten days, and, as usual, is
                            accompanied by his prime minister.</p>
                        <p>Crown Princess Victoria has given birth to a prince, of which happy event
                            you will, no doubt, be duly advised by a ceremonial letter of his
                            Majesty to the President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The Zollverein treaty of the German states, of which Prussia is the head,
                            expires by limitation in 1865. Three years ago a commercial treaty was
                            negotiated between Prussia and France, a copy of which I have heretofore
                            forwarded to the department. That treaty was intended as the basis for
                            the renewal of the Zollverein treaty between the German states. Through
                            the influence of Austria, with some of the states of the Zollverein,
                            negotiations for the renewal of that league, on the basis of the French
                            treaty, were delayed and postponed, until it became a necessity for
                            Prussia to announce that on the first of October the Zollverein treaty
                            would be definitely closed with all those states <pb facs="0249" n="225"
                                xml:id="pg_225"/> who chose to become parties to it. Bavaria,
                            Wurtemburg, Nassau, and Hesse Darmstadt had refused, up to the very last
                            moment, to accede to the treaty. The prospect of being excluded from the
                            benefit of a new Zollverein aroused the commercial and manufacturing
                            interests in those states to such a degree that economical and material
                            interests prevailed as against political sympathies and affiliations,
                            and, by the first instant, all of these states had given in their
                            adhesion, and a conference is now sitting here, in Berlin, to close up
                            and ratify the new Zollverein treaty for another period of twelve years
                            from January 1, 1866.</p>
                        <p>When the conference shall have completed its labors, the final
                            ratifications will be exchanged between France and Prussia for itself,
                            and on behalf of the other Zollverein states, an event which will note a
                            great triumph of Prussian diplomacy and influence in Germany.</p>
                        <p>When all the ratifications are exchanged, I will forward to the
                            department copies of the new treaties, and the schedule and tariffs
                            established thereby.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have your note of the 15th of October,
                            giving an account of a conversation with the French minister for foreign
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to perceive in his remarks no evidence of a consideration that
                            indifference to the struggle going on between this government and the
                            insurgents is infidelity towards the United States. Mr. Drouyn de l’Huys
                            seems to suppose that this country will ultimately recognize as friendly
                            towards itself even the concessions which are made to the insurgents,
                            because the insurgents, not less than the loyal men, are citizens of the
                            United States. He falls into the error of our northern apologists of the
                            insurrection—that is, of supposing that when the Union is restored the
                            south will regain and wield their former political influence. On the
                            contrary, it is clearly enough to be perceived now that the division
                            between north and south will disappear in this war, and that the loyalty
                            of the whole country will be homogeneous in the sentiments which are now
                            maintained by the government. I cannot but desire that France may, at
                            the end of the struggle, hold in relation to the United States the
                            position she held when the war began. Perhaps you may have another
                            opportunity to follow up the conversation.</p>

                            161, has been received. It is accompanied by information that Great
                            Britain, after deliberate consideration, has declined to enter the
                            congress proposed by the Emperor of the French. The President sincerely
                            hopes that the apprehensions of war in Europe, that attend the agitation
                            of the Emperor’s suggestion, may not be realized. If the great maritime
                            powers could now see the expediency of revoking their recognition of the
                            American insurgents as a naval belligerent, they would hasten the return
                            of peace in this hemisphere. If they themselves are going to engage in
                            war in their own hemisphere, I think they will soon find occasion to
                            regret the positions they have assumed in regard to the civil war which
                            distresses the American continent.</p>

                            received. The political occurrences which, under ordinary circumstances,
                            would be inconsequential, assume significance at this moment, when the
                            balance of power on the continent is seriously disturbed. I hope that
                            the withdrawal of members from the lower house of the legislature in
                            Belgium, so as to prevent a quorum, and defeat the administration,
                            forebodes nothing more than a resort to a constitutional election.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have your private note of the 15th of
                            July, which, I see, is tinged with a dark hue of apprehension. With my
                            present convictions I cannot think that any adjustment between Denmark
                            and Germany will increase our exposure to European assaults against our
                            independence. On the contrary, I think whatever arrangement is made,
                            there will be new jealousies among all the principal maritime powers.
                            The disturbances of this year adjourned to another will excite more
                            anxiety than any present outbreak would.</p>
                        <p>I think, however, that parties in both Great Britain and France will be
                            glad to leave foreign questions, for a time, to engage in domestic
                            agitation. Of course, we may have disasters here, although we are not
                            looking for them. War is war; and this is only another name for
                            uncertainty and vicissitude. But, in any case, <pb facs="0253" n="229"
                                xml:id="pg_229"/> we are so well prepared for foreign intervention
                            now, that I do not think we need to be disturbed by apprehensions of it.
                            If I do not mistake, all the high rebel expectations of becoming a naval
                            belligerent through the protection of Great Britain and France have
                            collapsed.</p>
                        <p>I am not able to see how the insurrection could stand six months, even if
                            we should not give it another effective blow.</p>
                        <p>Gold is falling; our stocks are rising; and our exports increasing now.
                            These circumstances seem to indicate that the systematic inflation of
                            rebel expectations which has been kept up in Europe since the opening of
                            the campaign has failed of effect.</p>
                        <p>I will tell Mr. Fessenden what you say about smuggling, and the means of
                            preventing it.</p>

                            the cotton loan. He also goes out to use his best endeavors to fit out

                            note of the 19th of August, which, as I perceive, was written under the
                            influence of wearisome waiting for good news.</p>
                        <p>Well, before this time you have been relieved. Admiral Farragut has
                            demonstrated the national strength and energy at Mobile. Sherman has
                            consummated his campaign, and established the power of the Union, if not
                            its authority, in Georgia. The political intrigues at Niagara have
                            exploded at Chicago, to the undoubted edification of the whole people of
                            the United States. The reenforcement of the armies is all that is
                            desired. Peace is certainly three years and three months nearer than it
                            was when the war began, and political movements on both sides of the
                            line indicate a rational conviction that peace must come soon as a fruit
                            of the sacrifices already made, and that when it shall have come it will
                            be attended by the firm re-establishment of the Union.</p>
                        <p>I think revolution is looming up in Europe everywhere, but it will not
                            come up this year.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>The wisdom of allowing Belgian subjects to take military service against
                            the republic of Mexico is the question which seems to be discussed in

                            foreign legion employed in America in such a cause can be depended upon.
                            It will be seen, I think, in the end, that European soldiers coming
                            hither ultimately become American republicans.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 15th of September, No. 215, which
                            mentions a probability that a special and extraordinary mission will be
                            sent by the Belgian government to the so-called Imperial government in
                            Mexico. I have also received your private note, which mentions that Mr.
                            Blondeel von Cuelebroeck, now minister plenipotentiary here, will likely
                            be appointed to fill that extraordinary mission.</p>
                        <p>This government can have no right to question such a proceeding by the
                            Belgian government, but it is easy to perceive that if the
                            representative of Belgium shall be sent to Mexico to recognize a foreign
                            imperial revolutionary government there, while the United States remain
                            in treaty relations with the native republican government still existing
                            in Mexico, and if that representative should, immediately after
                            performing that function, be returned to the United States to renew his
                            mission here, the transaction would then be liable to popular
                            misapprehension, which, even though it should not impair his usefulness,
                            might at least render his residence less agreeable than it is to be
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>You may verbally and unofficially suggest these considerations to Mr.
                            Rogier for his reflection.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have reason to believe that Belgium will
                            accept the invitation of the Emperor of the French to take part in the
                            proposed congress of European powers, but will probably wait upon the
                            action of the majority of the other powers before giving in its
                            adhesion. It is a position of some embarrassment to conciliate the <hi
                                rend="italic">role</hi> of a neutral power with participation in
                            such a congress, and the recognition of Victor Emanuel as king of Italy
                            by this government, when other European powers had refused, would seem
                            to have been construed as an abandonment in fact, if not in theory, of
                            the position of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>The announcement in the Emperor’s discourse from the throne, that the
                            treaties of Vienna had ceased to exist, seems to have excited
                            susceptibilities on the part of other powers, which have caused further
                            explanations to be made, modifying very materially its bearing as
                            applied to other states.</p>
                        <p>A circular to this effect has, I am informed, been received here to-day
                            at the French legation.</p>
                        <p>Italy, Spain, Portugal, Rome, Wurtemburg, and Saxony seem to be, thus
                            far, the only powers which have adhered to the proposition for a
                            congress. That the principle will be generally accepted, but that the
                            difficulty will be to come to an agreement as to its functions, seems to
                            be the general opinion here in political circles; and also, that if the
                            congress only meets, that fact, as annulling, <hi rend="italic">ipso
                                facto</hi>, the outlawry of the Bonapartes by the congress of
                            Vienna, will be a great gain for the Napoleonic dynasty.</p>
                        <p>This subject naturally excites great attention, solicitude, even, here,
                            as a symptom of, if not a remedy for, the gravity of the political
                            situation in Europe.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I learn that the reply of the King to the
                            invitation of Napoleon III’ touching the European congress, was
                            despatched on the 21st instant to be delivered on yesterday to the
                            Emperor. I have reason to believe that it expresses his willingness to
                            unite with other powers for an object so meritorious as that
                            indicated—the assurance of European peace. It would seem, at this
                            moment, that the Netherlands and Turkey are the only two powers that
                            have not replied, and in accepting the <hi rend="italic">principle</hi>
                            of a congress, there seems to be no doubt as to their replies. It is
                            very much to be doubted, however, whether there will be the same
                            unanimity when the questions for the decision of the congress shall come
                            to be decided upon, and, indeed, I think there is good reason to imagine
                            that the preliminary conference for that purpose will be the extent to
                            which the scheme of a congress will be realized. It will, in any event,
                            have served its purpose <hi rend="italic">vis a vis</hi> to the French
                            Chambers and people. The complications with respect to
                            Schleswig-Holstein, which have been aggravated by the death of the King
                            of Denmark, have come very opportunely in aid of the proposition for a
                            congress, and give an apt reply to the objections raised against it.</p>

                            awarded at the close of the general exhibition of fine arts of 1863 are
                            six which have fallen to French artists, three to German artists, and
                            two to artists of the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>If it was not accorded to the government of the King to have the
                            satisfaction of being able to include in this distribution one or two of
                            those of your national artists who took part in the exhibition, it is
                            not because the very real merit of their works was not fully
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>It is to be regretted that the jury on rewards, in derogation of constant
                            usage, abstained this time from addressing to the government a report
                            containing a methodical and deliberate review of the whole exhibition,
                            for, in the other case, it would have been a duty, according to
                            assurances given to me on the subject, to have pointed out in this work,
                            which would have received official publicity, the important significance
                            which we were gratified to recognize in those productions at the
                            exhibition forming the contingent from the artists of the North American
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I am glad that I may hope, sir, that, thanks to your kind offices, your
                            national artists will continue by the concurrence of their talents to
                            heighten the brilliancy and interests of our great public exhibitions of
                            the fine arts; they will there always meet with a sympathetic reception
                            and just appreciation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The usual official reception by the King
                            on the 1st of January, which for the past two years had been suspended
                            on account of his sickness, did not take place this year, and, owing to
                            slight indisposition, the King did not appear at the ball given at the
                            palace yesterday. I have nothing, therefore, to report in this
                            connexion.</p>
                        <p>Since my last despatch the house of representatives, after annulling the
                            election at Bruges and providing for the levying of taxes for the coming
                            year, adjourned over the holidays. Since coming together again on the
                            5th instant it has been occupied with the discussion of the “projet” of
                            address in reply to the discourse of the King on opening the legislative
                            session. The debates are characterized by a good deal of acrimony. The
                            political divisions of the country seem to become more and more sharply
                            marked, and party spirit, as this divergence increases, to become more
                            envenomed.</p>
                        <p>The new elections at Bruges take place on the 12th; should, as it is
                            possible, the conservative party carry them, the cabinet will be left in
                            a majority of two, will hardly be able to carry on the government, and
                            will probably resign.</p>
                        <p>The conservative party, as such, could not form a cabinet capable of
                            sustaining itself. Under these circumstances, and in the event of the
                            resignation of those now in power, a “business” cabinet would probably
                            be formed, if a certain number of the liberal party could be found to
                            support it, (which, with the present bitterness of feeling between the
                            parties, I think not very likely,) or Parliament would be dissolved and
                            recourse had to new elections.</p>
                        <p>The message of the President has been very favorably received by the
                            press and the public generally. The evidences of strength, public
                            confidence, credit, and a resolution to put down, at any cost, the
                            rebellion, which the message and accompanying documents furnish, seem to
                            shake the faith of those heretofore the most incredulous as to the
                            ultimate restoration of the authority of the government over the whole
                            territory of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The change in public sentiment within the past five weeks with regard to
                            the war, and its final result, has been as satisfactory as it has been
                            great. The cause of the rebellion seems to be considered as hopeless,
                            even by that class whose interests or whose instincts have caused them
                            to sympathize with it; and to the reproach which remained of seeking the
                            subjugation or extermination of those in arms against the government,
                            has come, very opportunely in reply, the proclamation of the President.
                            I regret not to have had the opportunity, on the new year, to have
                            learned the views of the King on this subject. You will remember the
                            hope expressed to me by his Majesty, in conversation the past summer,
                            that the occasion would be afforded to the people in rebellion to come
                            back to their allegiance through concessions which should give them a
                            means of return short of compulsion at the point of the sword or
                            humiliating exactions. I count upon having an opportunity of
                            conversation with his Majesty on this subject at an early day.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>The present legislation on the military service in Belgium, which is
                                based on the law of the 8th January, 1817, consists in no less than
                                twelve laws, besides numerous royal decrees and a large number of
                                administrative regulations. The consequence is that it is far from
                                being as clear as might be desired, and meets with great
                                difficulties in its application.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, reforms having been loudly called for, the
                                government, after taking the opinion of a special committee, has
                                brought forward a bill, of which a copy is herewith annexed,
                                revising the laws relative to military service. In this bill the
                                existing fundamental principles have been maintained, a long
                                experience having proved their superiority over all other systems
                                recommended.</p>
                            <p>In summing up the provisions of the law now in vigor, the alterations
                                introduced by the bill referred to will be vindicated.</p>
                            <p>The Belgian army is recruited by drafts and voluntary enlistments; it
                                consists—</p>
                            <p>1st. Of the effective force maintained under arms.</p>
                            <p>2d. Of the men who are left at or sent home on furlough.</p>
                            <p>By the terms of article 119 of the constitution the contingent of the
                                army is voted annually by the Chambers; the law which regulates it
                                is in force for one year only.<note n="*" xml:id="d208fn1">The
                                    intention of Congress was to establish a force in proportion to
                                    the necessities of the country, to prevent the arbitrary
                                    exercise of power on the part of the administration, and to
                                    avoid the danger to which a numerous army in time of peace might
                                    give rise.</note></p>
                            <p>The contingent of the army is fixed at 80,000 men, but the effective
                                force at present, as stated in the budget, amounts only to 35,000
                                men, 11,000 of whom are volunteers and 24,000 conscripts. They early
                                contingent of the levy has been fixed for upwards of twenty years at
                                a maximum of 10,000 men.<note n="†" xml:id="d208fn2">Had the
                                    contingent of the army followed the same progressive increase as
                                    the population it would now amount to 12,200 men. The population
                                    of Belgium, which in 1836 amounted to 3,785,814 inhabitants, was
                                    in 1859 4,623,089.</note></p>
                            <p>The contingent is furnished by drawing by lots from among all young
                                men, Belgians, married or unmarried, who on the 1st of January of
                                each year have attained their nineteenth year. All foreigners who
                                have attained their naturalization before accomplishing their twenty

                            <p>The organization of the French army is based upon three distinct
                                provisions of law:</p>
                            <p>1st. The law passed March 21, 1832, establishing the principle that
                                every Frenchman is liable to respond to a call in defence of his
                                country, and that none but Frenchmen are admissible into the
                                    army.<note n="*" xml:id="d208fn16">The law of March 9, 1831,
                                    authorizes the formation of a foreign legion, under condition
                                    that the same shall not he employed in France. The law of April
                                    16, 1856, sanctions the 1st and 2d foreign legions, forming two
                                    regiments of foreigners, whose service, administration, pay,
                                    organization, &amp;c., are assimilated to that of the infantry
                                    of the line.</note></p>
                            <p>2d. The law fixing annually the number of recruits to be levied.</p>
                            <p>3d. The annual appropriation act which fixes the number of men to be
                                maintained in active service, and the number of those to be called
                                for.</p>
                            <p>The French army is recruited by drafting, voluntary enlistments, and
                                re-engagements of veteran soldiers, and is composed of—</p>
                            <p>1st. The effective force maintained under arms.</p>
                            <p>2d. The reserve, comprising the contingent not yet called in, and
                                those who are sent home in anticipation of the expiration of their
                                term of service.</p>
                            <p>The annual levies are raised by drafts; every Frenchman who has
                                attained his twentieth year within the preceding twelve months is
                                bound to present himself to the authorities of his district. The
                                draft is made by cantons, and the number of men furnished by the
                                department and by canton is in proportion to the number inscribed on
                                the service rolls of each canton.</p>
                            <p>Up to the year 1830 the annual contingent was based on the
                                population; from 1831 to 1835 the proportion was graduated according
                                to the average of young men inscribed on the conscription lists of a
                                certain number of years preceding.<note n="†" xml:id="d208fn17">
                                    <p>In explanation of the mode, a scale regulating the number of
                                        men to be drafted, as fixed by the law of December 11, 1830,
                                        M. Lalanne, commissaire du Roy, says: “The law of March 8,
                                        1818, in the bill of the government presented the ‘<hi
                                            rend="italic">military population</hi>’ as a basis for
                                        the annual levy. The Chamber of Deputies substituted the
                                        whole population, on the ground that it gave a basis for
                                        arriving at the desired result made for other purposes than
                                        recruiting, and therefore not liable to be questioned. Since
                                        then, however, increasing complaints have been made against
                                        the system, and a return to the basis of ‘military
                                        population’ proposed. The commission charged by the
                                        government to prepare a new law has examined into the merits
                                        of the three bases, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the total
                                        population, the military population determined by the
                                        registers of the census, and which serves as the basis of
                                        the draft, and the same population, deduction made of those
                                        whose size or infirmities render them unfit for service. The
                                        commission has rejected the latter mode, as subject to
                                        serious inconveniences. It weighs heavily upon districts
                                        furnishing the largest contingent of the army, and tends to
                                        diminish the population both in numbers and in quality. The

                                        the remainder are not examined, and the relative proportion
                                        of those unfit for service cannot be ascertained. The
                                        commission has abandoned the basis ‘<hi rend="italic">whole
                                            population’</hi> for other reasons. The official census
                                        has not always been exact; some data was taken from
                                        statistical tables, the elements of which have often been
                                        erroneous or ill combined. Divers interests, moreover, have
                                        often determined some towns to either augment or reduce the
                                        number of their population. In the frontier departments,
                                        moreover, there is generally a large floating population
                                        which influences the number of the contingent without
                                        participation in the draft; in consequence, an unfair
                                        proportion of men are called out in these districts.</p>
                                    <p>“These two-fold advantages have induced the commission to
                                        propose as a basis for the draft the ‘<hi rend="italic"
                                            >military population’</hi> as given by tables of the

                            <p>According to M. Leon Lalanne, it is calculated that, owing to the
                                number of exemptions, about 175,000 men must be drawn to form a
                                contingent of 80,000 soldiers. In other words, 100 men have to be
                                drafted in order to secure 46 fit for service. In the department of
                                Lozere and Dordogne 73 men in 100 drafted were exempted.
                                Notwithstanding this, says M. Lalanne, France could raise annually
                                132,000 recruits, taking into consideration all kinds of exemptions,
                                and respecting the rights and satisfying the interests of all
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>The legal service of a soldier is fixed at 7 years, counting from the
                                1st of January after his 20th birthday.</p>
                            <p>Under the law of March 21, 1832, the young soldier is permitted to
                                furnish a substitute, subject, however, to rigorous conditions as to
                                morality and aptitude for service.</p>
                            <p>This system of substitution obtains only in practice, at present,
                                with regard to brothers, brothers-in-law, and relations up to the
                                fourth degree. Moreover, by the law of April 26, 1855, modified by
                                act of July 24, 1860, the exemption from service can be secured at a
                                fixed sum, which is applied to a fund for enlisting veteran
                                soldiers, by re-engaging at the end of their service as substitutes.
                                These re-engagements are for terms of not less than two years, and
                                not more than seven years.</p>
                            <p>Substitutes can be entered on the registers of the districts where
                                they present themselves in lieu of drafted men, provided they are
                                admitted as fit for service by the military board.</p>
                            <p>Young men of proper size, health, and morality can enter as
                                volunteers at the age of 16 in the navy, and at the age of 18 in the
                                army.</p>
                            <p>The reserve is formed of men who, although comprised in the levy,
                                have not been called upon to join their regiments, and are
                                consequently not in active service, and of such soldiers who have
                                been granted furloughs, in anticipation of the expiration of their
                                legal term of service.</p>

                                    says: “Substitution will no longer procure exemption of a
                                    brother, and has given rise to much complaint. A notable
                                    difference exists, indeed, between gratuitous volunteering and
                                    that which, without adding to the contingent, is simply a
                                    speculation. Nevertheless, exemption should be granted to the
                                    brothers of substitutes killed or discharged on account of
                                    wounds received or infirmities acquired in the service.”
                                    (According to the law of 10th March, 1818, exemption was granted
                                    to him whose brother was in actual service as a substitute.) The
                                    following amendment, proposed by M. Couterier, was rejected:
                                    “The soldier shall also have the benefit of these causes of
                                    exemption when they arise during his term of service.”
                                    Consequently, causes of exemption are valid only at the time of

                            <p rend="center">SYSTEM OF RECRUITING IN PRUSSIA.</p>
                            <p>Unlike the practice which obtains in most countries of Europe of
                                recruiting by conscription, military service in Prussia is
                                compulsory upon all, and without the chances of a draft or the
                                privilege of furnishing a substitute.</p>
                            <p>The basis of the Prussian system is the law of 3d September, 1814, by
                                which every Prussian is bound to military service from the age of 17
                                to 49.</p>
                            <p>During this period the service is divided as follows:</p>
                            <p>From the age of 20 to 25 (except in Westphalia, where it begins at
                                21,) every Prussian is liable to be called out for active service;
                                as a rule, however, he remains only three years with his regiment;
                                during the remaining two, in time of peace, he is sent home and
                                placed in the “reserve.”</p>
                            <p>From the age of 25 to 32 he serves in the “Landwehr,” first class;
                                and for a further term of seven years, say from 32 to 39, he remains
                                enrolled in the “Landwehr” of the second class.</p>
                            <pb facs="0270" n="246" xml:id="pg_246"/>
                            <p>In time of war and great emergency every man is liable up to his 49th
                                year to serve in the home guard, (Landsturm,) beginning, as above
                                stated, at the age of 17.</p>
                            <p>The duration of service is calculated from the date of entering the
                                army, so that if he present himself at an earlier age than required
                                by law the time is deducted,</p>
                            <p>Liability to serve dates from the 1st of January of the year of
                                arriving at the age of 20.</p>
                            <p>Those who have been educated at a military school or at the institute
                                of noncommissioned officers must remain in active service beyond the
                                usual three years—two years additional, if they were educated
                                entirely at the public expense, or one year if partially.</p>
                            <p>Those who volunteer before the age of 20, and are able to equip and
                                keep themselves, and capable of passing a specified examination,
                                remain for a term of one year only with their regiment, which is
                                considered as equivalent to active service of three years.</p>
                            <p>The present government of Prussia proposes to extend the term of
                                actual service to four years, and to augment the contingent of the
                                standing army, whilst the liberal party contend for a diminution of
                                the contingent, as well as a reduction of the time of service, from
                                three to two years. This conflict is still going on, but up to this
                                date no change has been made.</p>
                            <p>The government bases its proposition upon the fact that the army has
                                not kept pace with the population. The annual levy has varied for
                                the past thirty years from 60,000 to 63,000 men. This number, under
                                the law of 3d September, 1814, was based upon the then existing
                                census; thus, in 1816, Prussia had a population of 10,136,000
                                inhabitants, the levy amounting to 125 per cent.; it has now a
                                population of 18,210,000, and the levy amounts to 112 per cent.</p>
                            <p>According to Dieterici, Handbuch der Statistik des Preussischen
                                Staates, the Prussian army in active service in 1855 was 165,537
                                men; of these the service requires a renewal of one-third every
                                year. The number of recruits required annually is, therefore, 55,179
                                men, while by the census of the same year, 1855, the number of young
                                men of the age of twenty in the Prussian monarchy amounted to
                                147,614; about one-third, however, are found unfit for service, or
                                exempted on other grounds.</p>

                            <p>Those who serve as attendants in military hospitals for a term of one
                                year are exempted from farther service, but remain four years with
                                the reserve, and are afterwards liable to service in the
                                “Landwehr.”</p>
                            <p>Those who have served six months in the military train or transport
                                service are held to serve the remaining portion of their time in the
                                reserve, or “Landwehr,” if required.</p>
                            <p>Those enlisting for service in the navy are subject to the same
                                rules; they remain in the first class from the age of 20 to 25, in
                                the second from 25 to 32, and in the third from 32 to 39.</p>
                            <p>Those found to be under size, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> below five
                                feet, (Rhenish measure,) are put back into the next class, and the
                                military board decides whether the men are definitively exempted or
                                held at disposal, in which latter case “the men are liable to be
                                called in case of war.</p>
                            <p>With regard to size, the lowest for regiments of guards is 5 feet 5
                                inches, for one-fourth; another fourth must have at least 5 feet 6
                                inches, and the remaining one-half at least 5 feet 7 inches and
                                more.</p>
                            <p>For infantry, the size is 5 feet 2 inches, and 5 feet by exception,
                                if the man be otherwise robust.</p>
                            <p>For fusileer companies, such men who show natural agility, aptitude,
                                &amp;c., are selected; size as above.</p>
                            <p>Riflemen, as a rule, must not be less than 5 feet 2 inches, and not
                                above 5 feet 7 inches; some exceptions are admitted at 5 feet.</p>
                            <p>The same stipulations obtain with regard to the soldiers for the
                                military train.</p>
                            <p>The fitness for service is determined by professional men, but their
                                decision is not binding on the commission appointed for
                                examination.</p>
                            <p>In cases of infirmity the reports of the surgeons are subject to the
                                confirmation of the military board, which alone decides whether a
                                man is to be definitively discharged, or, unless he suffers from
                                incurable infirmity, is to be held at the disposal of the military
                                authorities, as provided in the preceding paragraph.</p>
                            <p>The following provisions to exemptions are made for persons who shall
                                be “favorably considered,” or are recommended for temporary
                                exemption:</p>
                            <p>1. Those who, in the opinion of the examination board, are the
                                support of families which might otherwise be subjected to want.</p>
                            <p>2. The only son of a widow, when there is no other member of the
                                family to provide for her or her family.</p>
                            <p>3. Persons who inherit, or unexpectedly acquire otherwise than by
                                purchase, property which they cannot leave in the hands of others,
                                without detriment to their interests, provided such property is of
                                sufficient value to furnish the means of living.</p>
                            <p>4. Tenants of crown lands, or other real estate, whose lease, owing
                                to the death of a parent or relative, or other circumstance, must be
                                renewed, and the occupation of which cannot be ceded to another
                                without prejudice to the property.</p>
                            <pb facs="0273" n="249" xml:id="pg_249"/>
                            <p>5. Owners of factories, or other industrial establishments, who are
                                employing a number of workmen, and cannot find a manager to take
                                their place, provided they have not actually acquired the property
                                by purchase at the time when liable to serve.</p>
                            <p>6. Those who, as sons of disabled parents, are considered as the only
                                and necessary assistants for the management of their property,
                                whether real or personal, factories, &amp;c., provided they are
                                unable to procure elsewhere the necessary assistance.</p>
                            <p>If it should turn out that the conditions indicated in the foregoing
                                six paragraphs result from purchase, leasing, or transfer of
                                property by the free will of the parties, the exemptions are
                                inadmissible. As a rule, no one liable to serve shall, before having
                                satisfied the provisions of the law, enter into any engagements
                                which tend to preclude, or render difficult, compliance with the
                                terms of the law.</p>
                            <p>Marriage contracted before the time of service is no cause of
                                exemption from service.</p>
                            <p>All temporary exemptions are granted, as a rule, for one year
                                only.</p>
                            <p>Exemptions are also accorded—</p>
                            <p>1. To those who bring indubitable proof of being engaged in acquiring
                                the knowledge of a profession, or art, the result of which would be
                                seriously affected by interruption of the studies.</p>
                            <p>2. Pupils of the industrial schools at Berlin.</p>
                            <p>3. Pupils of the medical school.</p>
                            <p>4. Pupils of veterinary schools.</p>
                            <p>On the 15th January, each year, the parish priest must send in a
                                minute of the births in his district for the past year. The local
                                authorities make up from these registers a list of all individuals
                                who have attained the seventeenth year, and these are entered on the
                                rolls.</p>
                            <p>Registers are also kept of those persons who have a legal residence
                                in the district, or who, without being born in the district, are
                                domiciled as servants, managers, clerks, apprentices, students, or
                                pupils.</p>

                            the palace on the 13th instant At the diplomatic circle, after some
                            conversation of a personal character, he inquired what my advices were
                            from home.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the result of the war was no longer doubtful; that men and
                            money were not wanting any more than the determination to put down the
                            rebellion. His Majesty said, he hoped that the exercise of force would
                            be tempered by conciliation, or some expression to that effect. I
                            replied that the late proclamation of amnesty of the President showed
                            that such was the spirit which inspired the government. He assented in a
                            general way, adding that he thought great forbearance and patience would
                            be still required before reaching the end.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The ministerial crisis still continues. The
                            King, after calling in turn, and without result, M. de Broukère and M.
                            Pirmey, both members of the liberal party, to form a cabinet, has turned
                            to the conservative party, and M. Deschamps and M. de Theux have been,
                            in succession, summoned to the palace, but with the same result. It
                            would seem that none are willing to undertake the reins of government
                            without the power to dissolve the Chambers—a strictly party cabinet
                            being impracticable in the present condition of parties in the Chambers,
                            where, owing to the death of one of the liberal members, M. Coumont,
                            they are equally balanced.</p>
                        <p>The conservatives desire a cabinet without political character, and for
                            business solely, as a sort of interregnum till the next election. The
                            other party are not disposed to enter into such a combination, and
                            desire to throw upon the conservatives the onus of carrying on the
                            government, or declaring their incapacity to do it; and this condition
                            of things is likely to remain for some time longer. Meanwhile, there is
                            a good deal of excitement and agitation on the subject throughout the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It would be a matter of no surprise to me if, as before stated, the
                            crisis should result in the permanent withdrawal of two or three members
                            only of the cabinet. If, however, they remain fixed in their present
                            position, of standing or falling together, and the party remains equally
                            determined not to accept a “business” cabinet, the probabilities are
                            that a cabinet of one or the other party will be formed with the
                            permission to dissolve the Chambers, and they will accordingly promptly
                            appeal to the people through new elections.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient

                            the tables of the “indirect” revenue of the state for the year 1863
                            compared with the revenues from similar sources in 1862.</p>
                        <p>The total in 1863 amounts to 116,750,364 francs, being an augmentation of
                            2,860,465 francs upon that of 1862, and about five and one-half million
                            francs more than the estimates.</p>
                        <p>This increase arises principally from spirits, beer, and vinegar,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I had, on yesterday, an audience of the
                            King, which I had asked for, in order to express to his Majesty some
                            considerations touching the withdrawal by the great maritime powers of
                            their recognition of the American insurgents as naval belligerents in
                            the sense of your despatch No. 125.</p>
                        <p>After some conversation on other topics, (which will be referred to in
                            another communication,) in reply to the hope expressed by his Majesty
                            for an early termination of the war, the effects of which were so deeply
                            felt in Europe, I said that my government, and the people of the United
                            States, had full confidence in bringing it to an early termination, and
                            in the only way possible to secure permanent peace—a restoration of the
                            authority of the government over the whole territory of the Union. That
                            after over two years and a half of war, and after furnishing over a
                            million and a half of volunteers and fifteen hundred millions of
                            dollars, the confidence in the result and the determination to put down
                            the rebellion at any cost had been but strengthened, as his Majesty
                            might perceive in the facility with which the government obtained fresh
                            resources in men and money from the people. About five-eighths of the
                            territory and population claimed by the insurgents was already restored
                            to the authority of the government, and the remainder exhausted,
                            crippled, and demoralized, were weaker than that proportion would
                            express.</p>
                        <p>Without pretending to fix a term to the war, which might be closed the
                            next campaign, or might continue over several, the result, it seemed to
                            me, could no longer be doubtful, and depended upon the action of the
                            great maritime powers of Europe. We were not fighting alone the
                            rebellion, but we had to contend against the support, moral and
                            material, given by those powers in Europe who called themselves our
                            friends. The recognition of belligerent rights had been and continued to
                            be an immense aid to the insurgents. Not alone in stimulating the hopes
                            of their leaders for a political recognition, and exciting to more
                            desperate resistance, but in enabling them to procure the means to
                            exercise, under the protection of those powers, detestable acts of
                            spoliation and destruction of peaceful merchantmen upon the high seas.
                            At this moment there were in the ports of France no less than three
                            English vessels, with English crews and armaments, fitting out to
                            continue their work of piracy under the so-called confederate flag.</p>
                        <p>If European governments desired peace, let them withdraw their moral
                            support to the rebellion, and refuse the means to the insurgents for
                            continuing the war by inhibiting these vessels access to and protection
                            in their ports. Such course would surely hasten the end. The contrary
                            course would but prolong the struggle and the sufferings in Europe, but
                            could not affect the result which the deliberate resolution of the
                            government and the people of the United States had determined upon. We
                            could, I continued, carry on the war for still a considerable period
                            without serious disturbance to our financial or industrial interests,
                            but could Europe long afford to continue to aid to prolong the war?
                            Every day’s continuance of the war, and a war tariff on foreign goods,
                            was adding to our independence of her and her manufactures, and
                            consequently tending to close her most important markets. Instead of
                            sending two hundred million dollars’ worth of goods to the United States
                            to buy cotton, France and England were now sending specie to distant
                            lands to pay five prices for cotton to people who needed few clothes,
                            and were but triflng consumers of their manufactures. If this were long
                            continued, to the great embarrassments of a financial crisis would be
                            likely to be added the calamity of a monetary crisis, and with <pb
                                facs="0276" n="252" xml:id="pg_252"/> it suspension of specie
                            payments. Again, the continuance of the war would but make more
                            wide-spread the desolation in the cotton-producing States, and inflict
                            upon Europe a more prolonged period of high prices for cotton. Was not
                            the time come for this subject to be seriously considered by European
                            governments? Now, the withdrawal of the recognition of belligerent
                            rights to the insurgents would be considered a gracious and friendly
                            act, which would do much to allay the irritation which had been excited
                            among our people; the time might not be far distant when the condition
                            of the south would necessitate its withdrawal, and when we should have a
                            right to claim it from those who would remain our friends. His Majesty
                            had already lent his powerful influence in favor of justice and peace in
                            the matter of the stoppage of the iron-clad vessels building for the
                            confederates in England, and his action, as on other important
                            occasions, had been highly appreciated by my government. Could not that
                            influence, acquired by the exercise of well-directed efforts in favor of
                            peace and of good relations between peoples in both hemispheres, be now
                            employed to promote the cause of peace in America, and would it not be
                            an act of humanity, not only to the insurgents, but to the suffering
                            classes of Europe, to counsel a withdrawal of that aid hitherto given to
                            the rebellion against the government and integrity of a friendly
                            power?</p>
                        <p>His Majesty listened attentively to the remarks of which the above is the
                            substance, and said I was right in supposing that his earnest efforts in
                            the future, as in the past, would be directed in favor of peace. He
                            would be gratified, he continued, if any way could be found by which
                            that desirable end could be obtained in the United States towards which
                            he had long entertained, as he had now, feelings of special friendly
                            interest, and he hoped to see an early termination to this war, the
                            disastrous effects of which were so wide-spread, and that it should be
                            effected in a spirit of conciliation.</p>
                        <p>If, he said further, the President should ever desire his aid in the
                            cause of peace it would be cheerfully given. His Majesty, save in
                            expressions of assent to various propositions made in the course of my
                            remarks, did not express (nor did I expect him to) any opinion upon
                            their subject-matter, viz., the expediency of the withdrawal of
                            belligerent rights to the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The King, in his audience to-day, after
                            expressing the gratification with which he had perused the letter of the
                            President to his Majesty in reply to his award in the Macedonian case,
                            and requesting me to communicate the same to him personally, spoke with
                            a good deal of earnestness of the desire he had to have a line of
                            steamships established between Antwerp and the United States. He
                            expressed the hope that we would, on our side, lend our aid to this end.
                            His Majesty seemed to count more upon American enterprise for such an
                            undertaking than upon that of Belgium. I said to the King, in reply,
                            that I thought it very possible, if the project of aiding emigration to
                            the United States should be realized, that Antwerp, the natural outlet
                            for a large portion of the continent, might be made the seat of a bureau
                            of emigration, and a point of departure for emigrants. This would
                            greatly promote the creation of a steamship <pb facs="0277" n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253"/> line, and, I added, that when the war was over,
                            some of our national vessels, which had been purchased from the merchant
                            service, and were adapted for such purposes, would possibly be employed
                            in the transportation of mails to countries with which we had not now
                            direct communication. Under our new postal convention, providing for
                            special transit privileges through Belgium for correspondence, Antwerp
                            or Ostend would be the most favorable point on the continent for the
                            distribution of mails, and consequently for the terminus of such a line.
                            While our present practice was not to grant subsidies to mail ships
                            otherwise than the allowance of the postage earned, his Majesty might be
                            assured that there would be on our part every desire to aid in making
                            still closer and more intimate friendly relations between the two
                            countries in the way he had indicated.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to report my arrival here
                            on the 25th instant, having landed at Southampton on the 15th.</p>
                        <p>I had an interview with M. Rogier on the following day. The conversation
                            was desultory; the main object of my visit, after paying my respects to
                            the minister of foreign affairs, being to have a day fixed for the
                            exchange of the ratification of the treaties of which I was the bearer
                            from Washington. M. Rogier made inquiries touching the progress of our
                            war, the colossal proportions of which and the frightful loss of life
                            had, he said, astonished the world, and asked when I thought it would
                            terminate. I replied, with the suppression of the rebellion; that
                            neither men, means, nor determination on the part of the government and
                            people were wanting to that end; that I had been confirmed by my visit
                            to the United States, and contact with our people in all parts of <pb
                                facs="0278" n="254" xml:id="pg_254"/> the country, in the conviction
                            that the government would be upheld in its purpose of restoring its
                            authority over the whole country; we had strong faith that the next
                            campaign would bring the war to an end; that this campaign would result
                            in the defeat of Lee and fall of Richmond. But would we be able to
                            provide for the expense of a long-continued war? he rejoined. I replied,
                            that the history of the past three years would serve to form a judgment
                            for the future. Our people had lent over seventeen hundred millions of
                            dollars to the general government, besides furnishing hundreds of
                            millions additional to the State and municipal governments, and to
                            soldiers, to aid in the prosecution of the war; they were still
                            supplying the means to carry on the war, and it was to be doubted if
                            these resources exceeded the surplus gains of the country. The markets
                            of Europe, too, were open to us if we deemed it expedient to accept
                            their proffers of money, which had not been wanting. I had seen no signs
                            of exhaustion in the country. So far from growing weaker physically by
                            the war, we were daily gaining strength. Our population to-day was three
                            millions more than at the commencement of the war. Whatever the
                            difficulties attendant upon carrying on the war, it must and would go
                            on. M. Rogier expressed his astonishment at the evidence of the power
                            and wealth of the United States which this war had brought forth, and
                            his hope that it would be brought to an early termination.</p>
                        <p>The resignation tendered by the ministers to the King has been withdrawn
                            at his request, and the cabinet has carried through most of the business
                            of the legislative session (which will probably be terminated next week)
                            with the feeble majority of from one to three votes. The probability is,
                            that the Parliament will be dissolved, and an appeal made to the people
                            by new elections late in the autumn.</p>
                        <p>The health of the King I am happy to be able to inform you is
                            excellent.</p>

                            non-commissioned officers and soldiers, and the same amount to be given
                            at the expiration of their service, with return passage to Antwerp.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>A new cause of excitement and agitation,
                            tending to envenom still more the relations between the two political
                            parties of this country, has absorbed public attention here for the past
                            week.</p>
                        <p>On the 30th ultimo M. Orts presented, in the house of representatives, a
                            bill based upon the law of 1856, adding six representatives and three
                            senators to the representation in parliament, this increase being made
                            to correspond with the augmentation of the population of the country,
                            according to local statistics, and in accordance with the provision of
                            the constitution by which one representative is accorded to every forty
                            thousand inhabitants, and one senator to two representatives.</p>
                        <p>The passage of this bill would strengthen the cabinet, as the 250,000
                            increase of population is, for the most part, in the centres of trade
                            and industry where, with the exception of Antwerp, the liberal party has
                            the ascendant; thus Brussels, having an increase since 1859 of 80,000
                            inhabitants, is allowed by the bill two additional representatives;
                            Liege, one; Antwerp, one, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The bill has raised a storm of disapprobation on the part of the
                            opposition, which insists that, according to the law of 1856, the
                            general decennial census (to take place in 1866) should precede any new
                            apportionment of representatives, and that it is contrary to the spirit
                            of the constitution.</p>
                        <p>In the session of the house of representatives on the 1st instant, M.
                            Dumortier, in the name of his political friends, in a note evidently
                            prepared in concert with the members of his party, after having dwelt
                            upon their moderation since the renewal of the sessions of parliament in
                            indulging in no factious opposition to the cabinet, stated their
                            objections to the bill, and demanded an explanation of the government
                            touching its position with respect to it. M. Rogier replied that the
                            cabinet intended to support the bill of M. Orts, and saw therein none of
                            the dangers or unconstitutional acts which M. Dumortier had indicated.
                            M. Dumortier replied that his party would be neither their dupes nor
                            their victims; that he and his friends were now determined to bring
                            about a dissolution of parliament by every legal means; that they had
                            not desired, and did not desire, to obstruct the public service; that
                            they would vote a provisional credit for the appropriations to the
                            department of public works (the most important in the budget, and the
                            only remaining section before the house) for the number of months which
                            the minister of public works would declare to be necessary upon a
                            dissolution of parliament, but that they would not vote upon a
                            revolutionary bill.</p>
                        <p>A most stormy and excited debate followed, before the termination of
                            which most of the members of the right left the house in a body. At the
                            next session, on the 5th instant, the cabinet and its supporters only
                            were present, fifty-six members in all, three members belonging to the
                            liberal party being absent, and it adjourned over to the following day,
                            and continues to adjourn from day to day to await the arrival of M.
                            Tesch, minister of justice, who is absent in (Germany, <pb facs="0280"
                                n="256" xml:id="pg_256"/> and is expected here by the end of the
                            week. His presence, together with that of M. de Brouckere and of M.
                            Cumont, an invalid, will give the required quorum (one more than half
                            the whole number of members) and majority to enable the cabinet to carry
                            its measures. It is probable, therefore, that the remaining sections of
                            the budget and the bill of M. Orts will be passed immediately upon his
                            arrival.</p>
                        <p>I hardly think that this will lead to any more serious steps than a
                            manifesto on the part of the “conservative” party. The dissolution of
                            the Chambers will probably take place in any event in October, and new
                            elections held with a better prospect, in view of the addition of
                            members to be given by the bill of M. Orts, of obtaining a small
                            majority for the cabinet.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It was believed that the house of
                            representatives would be able to proceed with business on the 9th
                            instant, the presence of M. Tesch, with that of M. Cumont, the invalid
                            member, assuring the necessary quorum of fifty-nine and a majority of
                            one for the government.</p>
                        <p>M. Cumont, who was to have been transported to the house on that day, was
                            unable to be present, and the fifty-eight members separated to meet
                            again on the 12th.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th M. Cumont died. The government is consequently left without a
                            majority, and the house without a quorum in the absence of the
                            conservative members. On the 12th they again came together, and, after
                            calling the roll, the president announced that due notice would be given
                            of the next sitting. The following day the senate, after completing the
                            business before it, received communication of a royal decree closing the
                            legislative session of 1863-‘64; a decree of dissolution of the house
                            and ordering new elections will doubtless soon follow, and the canvass
                            cannot but be a very excited one.</p>
                        <p>The government thus finds itself without the usual appropriations for the
                            department of public works; it is the most important of all, the
                            administration of the railroads of the state falling under this head;
                            but I presume the public service will not be permitted to suffer, and
                            that the cabinet will direct the usual expenditure to be made, relying
                            upon subsequent sanction by parliament. I understand that the
                            dissolution of the house of representatives will be announced
                            immediately, and elections ordered for early in September. This,
                            however, does not appear to me to be a solution of the difficulty; the
                            elections will be closely contested, and if the conservatives come into
                            power, it will probably be by a small majority. They will have against
                            them the senate, where there is a “liberal” majority of six, and the
                            only recourse would appear in such event to be a dissolution of that
                            body, with the chances of failure to replace it by a senate having a
                            majority of their friends.</p>

                            occasioned her departure on the 2d for a short cruise. By despatch from

                            name of Count d’Ardennes, left Brussels for Paris on the 19th instant,
                            and after visiting the Empress, the following day proceeded to Vichy,
                            where the Emperor has been for some days past. He will probably, I
                            understand, remain there a week or two. This visit has naturally given
                            rise to many conjectures, among which the settlement of the Danish
                            question, a new phase in the relations between France and Great Britain,
                            and the possibility of a marriage between the Count de Flandre, now in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have had the honor to receive your
                            despatch, No. 133, under date of the 4th instant, with enclosures.</p>
                        <p>The Niagara and Sacramento are now at Antwerp; have been well received,
                            and no objection offered to their frequent visits, to taking supplies,
                            or getting <pb facs="0282" n="258" xml:id="pg_258"/> repairs; on the
                            contrary, I have reason to believe that their visits afford
                            gratification to the authorities, as their presence has been of
                            excellent effect upon them and the people of the country generally.</p>
                        <p>So long as the policy of Great Britain and France forbids the usual
                            courtesy and aid to our national ships, which we extend to those of all
                            friendly powers, the Scheldt, with its easy access, commanding position,
                            safe shelter, and abundant supplies, would seem to afford all the
                            facilities which are denied them elsewhere. I am informed by Commodore
                            Craven and Captain Walke that the authorities at Flushing have also
                            given them a hearty welcome, and extended to them every accommodation,
                            and I cannot but express the hope that we shall ask as little
                            hospitality as is compatible with the exigencies of the public service
                            in the ports of those countries which give it so grudgingly.</p>
                        <p>Supplies of all kinds can be obtained, probably cheaper than at any other
                            port, at Flushing or Antwerp. Arrangements can easily be made here or in
                            England for the delivery of coals alongside the ships at stated places,
                            and the Belgian coals are, I believe, preferred by our engineers. The
                            ships could appear constantly off the French and English ports,
                            communicate with our officials, and exercise all necessary vigilance
                            without entering them, save by stress of weather, if this treatment of
                            our national flag is to continue. There seems, however, to be a
                            disposition not to insist upon a rigorous application of the existing
                            regulations to our ships-of-war, judging from the fact that the
                            Kearsarge is permitted, without objection, to lie in wait for the
                            Rappahannock, now at Calais, from the opposite port of Dover.</p>
                        <p>The destruction of the Alabama by the Kearsarge, and the frequent
                            appearance of our ships-of-war in or off neighboring ports, has been
                            productive of good effects on the public mind. Attention has been thus
                            drawn to our naval strength, and details concerning our vessels, their
                            armament, &amp;c., are given in the press and eagerly sought by the
                            public. An end, too, has been put to the reproach often made, that while
                            making so frequent reclamations touching the building or harboring of
                            rebel craft we did not show interest enough in their capture to keep
                            even a force equal to that of the “confederates” within ten days’ sail
                            of our principal navy yard; that but one steamer, the Kearsarge, was in
                            the waters off the French and English coast, when three confederated war
                            vessels, and seven more rapidly approaching completion, were in ports of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>In this connexion I would again call your attention to the possibility of
                            procuring seamen for our navy in this country. As has been before
                            observed, there is no legal impediment in Belgium to the engagement of
                            soldiers or sailors for our service.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the easy access from the Baltic ports, where the best sailors
                            of Europe are to be found, there are many Belgians employed on the
                            canals here who have been for the most part sailors or fishermen on the
                            high seas, and who now, owing to the competition of the railways,
                            finding their calling unremunerative, would, if opportunity offered,
                            seek, I doubt not, service in our navy. If we had, as suggested in a
                            previous despatch, a receiving-ship in the Scheldt (say at Flushing) to
                            which sailors could be directly sent, and from which they could be
                            transferred for distribution to our navy yards or to other vessels, I
                            think a great saving might be made in the bounties now given for seamen,
                            as well as of time in procuring the crews we so urgently need.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p>The general elections for the house of representatives, held on
                            yesterday, passed off, although amid great excitement, more quietly than
                            had been apprehended. The incomplete returns, obtained through
                            unofficial sources, are more favorable to the “liberal” party than its
                            partisans even seem to have anticipated. It has carried, by small
                            majorities, its whole ticket in the two districts where the elections
                            were most bitterly and sharply contested—Bruges and Ghent—and M.
                            Dechamps, the leader of the “conservative” party, has been defeated at
                            Charleroi.</p>
                        <p>The cabinet is thus secure in its place, and will, it is now believed

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The election returns confirm the report in
                            my last despatch of a majority of twelve for the cabinet in the house of
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>There will be, probably, some contested seats, but I hardly think this
                            majority will be materially changed.</p>
                        <p>The election has been a very close one, the majority of “liberals” on the
                            aggregate vote of the whole country, which was over 83,000, appearing to
                            have been about 500.</p>
                        <p>The strongholds of the “liberal” party continue to be the great centres
                            of trade and industry, while those of the “conservatives” are the rural
                            districts. In Brussels and other districts, with two or three
                            exceptions, where, heretofore, these have rarely made opposition on
                            account of the overwhelming strength of their opponents, they have put
                            up their candidates for election, and have thus been able to count
                            pretty correctly their strength in the country.</p>
                        <p>Since 1857 the “liberal” party has been gradually losing ground, and but
                            for the act of the “conservatives” in breaking up the house of
                            representatives by their organized abstention from its sessions—an act
                            not approved by the whole party, while it united the “liberals,” and
                            gave them a cause of complaint before the country—the probabilities were
                            that the “conservatives” would have come into power.</p>
                        <p>If the leaders of the “liberal” party will profit by their narrow escape,
                            and turn their attention rather to measures touching the industrial and
                            commercial affairs of the country than to questions which bring them in
                            collision with the faith and religious belief of a large portion of the
                            population, and which the natural jealousy of the influence of the
                            Church of Home in their internal affairs has excited, I think that they
                            are assured a long lease of power.</p>
                        <p>It is the acrimonious discussions which have been raised on questions
                            touching the privileges and powers of the church, or institutions under
                            it, which have <pb facs="0284" n="260" xml:id="pg_260"/> created the
                            profitless bitterness and rancor between parties, and which, in case of
                            the victory of the “conservatives,” would, doubtless, have led to acts
                            of violence in some places. The country is very prosperous; its people
                            have a larger measure of liberty, greater freedom of political action,
                            and, in their municipal life, approach more nearly self-government than
                            in any monarchy in Europe. There would seem to be no reason why, with
                            more attention paid by political parties to the material interests of
                            the country and the wants of the masses, and less to questions which
                            clash with faith or religious scruples or liberty, this country should
                            not continue to be the freest, least taxed, and most prosperous on the
                            hemisphere.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The new house of representatives met on
                            the 3d instant, and, after three days’ animated debates on contested
                            elections, was organized on the 6th by the re-election of its former
                            officers.</p>
                        <p>The credits left in suspense by the dissolution of the last house were
                            voted; the proposition of M. Orts, increasing the popular representation
                            in the national legislature, with a modification providing for an
                            additional senator from Brussels, instead of, as originally proposed,
                            from Louvain, was reported from the sections for first reading, lies
                            over, and will probably be acted on next session, and the house
                            adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi> on the 3d instant.</p>
                        <p>There were two incidents in this short session worthy of notice: the
                            first was a discussion upon an interpellation by M. Coomans, touching
                            the organization in this country of a Belgian legion for service in
                            Mexico, for details of which I beg to refer to my despatch No. 214; and
                            the other the debate upon the supplementary credit of 5,575,000 francs
                            for the completion of the fortifications of Antwerp.</p>
                        <p>This latter question, upon which the liberal party is not united, gave
                            rise to a lively and acrimonious discussion, and was decided by a close
                            vote in favor of the government, which would seem to owe to the
                            abstention of some members, and the absence of others, an escape from a
                            possible defeat.</p>
                        <p>This long-agitated subject of the fortifications of Antwerp thus seems to
                            be finally disposed of, saving at Antwerp, where local interests will
                            probably for some time to come be occupied with it.</p>
                        <p>I enclose from the Moniteur the debate, which is interesting, especially
                            the able defence by General Chazal, the minister of war, of the system
                            and policy of fortifications.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I enclosed to you on the 6th of July, in
                            my despatch No. 199, a notice published by General Chapelie, inviting
                            recruits for a Belgian legion to serve in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Soon after I called M. Rogier’s attention, incidentally, to this notice,
                            and asked him if the government was a party to this organization of
                            troops. He replied that it was not; that, as a government, they had
                            nothing to do with it; that they had, however, given permission to
                            Belgians in their service who desired to go, for without it they
                            forfeited their nationality as Belgians. There was nothing in their
                            laws, he continued, which prevented recruiting in Belgium for foreign
                            service, provided it was not against a nation with which they were at
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>This subject, coupled with the appearance in the streets of the recruits
                            in Mexican uniform, has naturally excited public attention, and in the
                            sitting of the 2d, on a motion by M. Coomans, he inquired of the
                            minister of war if it was true that Belgian soldiers had received
                            authorization from the government to take military service in Mexico,
                            and upon what laws it was based. The minister replied that it was in
                            accordance with numerous precedents, and he did not see why exception
                            should be made against those Belgians wishing to serve a daughter of the
                            King, who is a sovereign in another country.</p>
                        <p>An animated and interesting debate followed, which I enclose from the
                            Moniteur, and which shows considerable embarrassment on the part of the
                            government, and on the part of its friends, to defend its course, such
                            as it is; for its effect would seem to tend to put the representatives
                            of liberalism in Belgium in a false attitude before the liberal
                            sentiment of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The motion of Mr. Coomans, expressing the regret of the house that the
                            government had authorized the promotion in Belgium of a Belgian military
                            corps for service in a foreign country, failed by a vote of 39 for and
                            53 against. A substitute, by M. Bara, declaring that “the house, in
                            presence of the formal declaration that the government has remained and
                            will remain completely aloof from the encouragement of a corps destined
                            to serve in Mexico, proceed to the order of the day,” passed by a vote
                            of 50 for and 36 against.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p>The Beige-Mexican corps which is organizing here, and to which reference
                            has been heretofore made, seems to progress but slowly. I am informed
                            that but about one-half the number contemplated (2,000) has been
                            enlisted. The cause appears to be the want of funds to carry out the
                            original plan. There seems to be a good deal of feeling against this
                            expedit on on the part of a portion of the population here, which I
                            would not be surprised to see take the form of some public

                            circular despatch of 12th ultimo, and your communications marked
                            “private,” under date of September 17, 19, and of 4th instant. The
                            latter, touching the appointment of the present Belgian minister to the
                            United States on an extraordinary mission to Mexico, will be acted upon
                            in accordance with your suggestion. M. Rogier is out of town, and will
                            be absent for a week or so longer.</p>
                        <p>The King is absent on a visit to Germany and Switzerland, to return early
                            the coming month.</p>
                        <p>A corps of Belgians, about 600, according to the. journals, recruited
                            here for service in Mexico as “Empress Guard,” have left here for the
                            country, via St. Nazaire, and sailed last week in the regular French
                            packet for Vera Cruz. Want of funds will probably be an obstacle to the
                            completion of the enlistment proposed here. Apart from the
                            dissatisfaction which seems to be felt among the soldiers and officers
                            as well, the debates in the Chambers reported to you, and which will
                            doubtless be resumed at the next session, have also tended to make the
                            service unpopular; and my impression is that the “Mexican Empire” cannot
                            safely count upon more soldiers from Belgium, even had it the funds to
                            continue recruiting.</p>

                            chambers commenced on the 8th instant. There was no discourse from the
                            throne, the King having only returned on the 15th.</p>
                        <p>The budget for the year 1865, which has just been distributed, estimates
                            the receipts at $32,000,000 in round numbers, being an augmentation upon
                            the year 1864 of $370,000, and the credits asked for amount to
                            $30,720,000, showing an excess of receipts over expenditures of
                            $1,100,000. This excess, however, is applied to extraordinary expenses
                            of public utility, provided for by anterior legislative enactments.</p>

                        <p>The most notable diminution, it will be seen, is in the receipts from
                            customs. This is owing to the suppression of some duties, as provided by
                            the convention with France, the reduction of duties on timber, &amp;c.,
                            and the suppression or reduction of various duties about to be proposed
                            to parliament. The expense of collecting the small amount of this branch
                            of revenue is 34 per cent. The duties are less than 10 per cent. upon
                            the valuation of the imports. A sound liberal policy would seem to
                            dictate their total abandonment at no distant day.</p>
                        <p>The real estate tax, (foucier,) which is a fixed tax, has not increased
                            with the value of the land; had it followed that increase it would
                            produce near double the present amount.</p>
                        <p>The most important augmentation is in the receipts from the railroads.
                            These are to a great extent the property of the state, and the steadily
                            progressive increase of their receipts has become a most important
                            element of the public revenue.</p>
                        <p>The budget presents a favorable contrast with those of neighboring
                            states, and gives marked evidence of the great and increasing prosperity
                            of the country. I send it herewith.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your most obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The news of the almost unanimous election
                            of the Union ticket reached here on the 21st, and has made a profound
                            impression here and throughout Europe. It is received and commented on
                            by the public press and in political circles in accordance with
                            sympathies for or hostile to republican institutions. While the organs
                            which represent the latter feeling consider and deplore this result as
                            giving assurance of a prolongation of the war, the representatives of
                            more liberal sentiment hail it as a triumphant vindication of the
                            principles of self-government, and an assurance that the Union has
                            passed safely through its greatest trial, and is to stand as their great
                            exemplar through ages.</p>
                        <pb facs="0289" n="265" xml:id="pg_265"/>
                        <p>I enclose some of the comments of the newspapers here on the receipt of
                            the news, and would call your attention to an article from the Journal
                            de Gaud, also enclosed, as a fair rendering of the enlightened liberal
                            sentiment of the country. As Ghent is the great centre of cotton
                            manufacture of Belgium, this journal may be supposed to speak
                            authoritatively, in so far as this country is concerned, for that class
                            in favor of which the sympathies of the world have been so loudly
                            invoked, by reason of the war.</p>
                        <p>The deep interest with which our struggle is regarded in Europe, both by
                            the party of liberal progress and those hostile to it, becomes every day
                            more apparent, and the causes of that interest are more openly admitted.
                            The former see in our success the vindication of the principles they
                            profess, and the reasons for the reforms they are struggling for. The
                            question of slavery seems to them now, so far as my observation extends,
                            however much at the outset it seemed to enlist their sympathy, but of
                            minor importance. While desiring, on the broad ground of philanthropy,
                            that it should be extirpated, they do not appear to consider its
                            extirpation or existence as likely to have any practical bearing on this
                            side of the Atlantic; while, on the other hand, the safe issue of the
                            “grand republique” from this tremendous struggle would, they assert,
                            have a profound and far-reaching influence in the world; that from it
                            would date a new era of progress and reform in Europe, while its fall
                            would be likely to have a contrary effect, and to cause a reaction from
                            the present liberal tendencies of the age.</p>
                        <p>Their opponents, on the contrary, seem to dread our success as likely to
                            prepare the way for trouble and revolutions in Europe, as did the
                            successful result of our revolutionary struggle in 1776, and to think
                            that no effort should be spared to avert it; and hence the bitter,
                            unscrupulous, and mendacious course which their organs in the public
                            press have pursued toward us.</p>
                        <p>It would do much for the right understanding of our cause abroad if we
                            had in some journal in Europe a recognized organ, which could give
                            authoritative information touching the war, our finances, and the
                            general progress of the country. Such a journal ought to be independent
                            of local politics. The newspapers which now give the best information on
                            our affairs are organs of the liberal party, which, except in Belgium,
                            is generally in opposition to the government, and their character for
                            impartiality is, therefore, likely to be called in question. Its
                            appearance would be opportune at this moment, when the popular belief in
                            the unfavorable termination of our war has been so rudely shaken by the
                            result of the presidential election.</p>
                        <p>While the determination thus evinced by the people of the United States
                            to put down, at any sacrifice, the rebellion, must have great influence
                            in determining a favorable policy of European governments towards us,
                            that result would be likely to be more certain if we made an effort at
                            this time for the enlightenment of the public in the direction
                            indicated.</p>

                            voted; one of the “liberal” members, M. Goblet, intimating, in reply to
                            re marks of M. Kerryn de Lettenhove in favor of the Mexican empire, that
                            it was not then the occasion to discuss that subject; that they would

                            opinion upon the character of the intervention in Mexico. To an inquiry
                            by one of the members why a full mission was provided for to Mexico and
                            not to the United States and Brazil, the minister of foreign affairs
                            replied that they but returned the courtesy which had been made to them.
                            As an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary had been
                            accredited to them by the Emperor of Mexico, they proposed responding by

                            received. The success of the internal improvement system which the
                            Portuguese government has adopted is justly a subject of felicitation. I
                            entertain no doubt that the complete development of it will greatly
                            increase the strength and enhance the prosperity of Portugal. For a
                            nation to be without iron roads in these times is to be in the world,

                            257, have been received.</p>
                        <p>From these papers I learn that about the 14th of January last you
                            received information, deemed reliable, that the British brig Aggression,
                            laden with military supplies, was on her way to a rendezvous at the
                            Azores, there to meet and transfer these supplies to piratical cruisers
                            which are engaged in devastating the commerce of the United States on
                            the high seas. That you represented this fact to the Duke de Soule, who
                            thereupon promptly procured from his Majesty, the King of Portugal, the
                            necessary directions, and caused them to be conveyed at once to the
                            magistracy and other officers of his Majesty in the Azores, enjoining
                            them to prevent and defeat the iniquitous design of the pirates. I
                            learn, further, that the Portuguese government not only caused
                            duplicates of those directions to be placed in the hands of the
                            commander of the United States ship-of-war St. Louis, to be conveyed by
                            him to their destination, but that the government also despatched a
                            public armed vessel to intercept the pirates and prevent the intended
                            violation of the neutrality of Portugal in her island possessions. I
                            learn, further, that you gave instructions to the commander of the St.
                            Louis to proceed to the Azores, and also gave to our consuls there the
                            advice and directions which the exigency apprehended seemed to render
                            necessary. These facts have been submitted to the President, and I have
                            now the <pb facs="0293" n="269" xml:id="pg_269"/> pleasure of making
                            known to you his approval and commendation of all that you have thus
                            done. I am especially directed to sanction the terms in which you have
                            expressed to the Duke de Soule your convictions of the satisfaction with
                            which his proceedings would he regarded by the President.</p>
                        <p>You are well aware that the government and people of the United States
                            have never ceased to regard the concession made by the European powers
                            to the insurgents of a belligerent maritime character as a proceeding
                            not less unfriendly and invidious than it was exceptional and
                            unwarranted by the treaties existing between this country and those
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>It has, as we believe, protracted what was merely ephemeral sedition, and
                            invested it with the severe features of a deadly civil war. Although we
                            think that we have shown to the world sufficient proofs that the
                            attempted revolution is not only causeless, but criminal, and also that
                            we have the ability to suppress it and save the integrity of the
                            country, yet the maritime powers still adhere pertinaciously to the
                            attitude they originally assumed, and thus persevere in derogating us
                            from our position as a sovereign power to one of mere equality with
                            citizens standing in armed rebellion against the government. The
                            remembrance of this injustice may be expected to survive the contest
                            itself, and to modify for a long time the sentiments of the United
                            States towards the maritime powers. Every state must see that, if the
                            United States survive this crisis, all the maritime powers must at some
                            period, sooner or later, recede from the attitude of which we complain.
                            It is equally manifest that some one of the states must take the lead in
                            the path of reconsideration, and that the states which earliest return
                            to their former relations with us will be esteemed hereafter as more
                            just and generous than those who shall defer that return until a period
                            when even their hostility would be harmless.</p>
                        <p>It is a matter of history that the United States have faithfully
                            cherished through more than three-fourths of a century the memory of the
                            favor and friendship they received from France, Spain, and Holland in
                            the struggle which separated them from Great Britain. This insurrection
                            is to them a trial quite as severe as that revolutionary contest was. It
                            may well be expected that they will cherish the recollection of any just
                            and generous conduct towards them on the part of foreign nations as
                            faithfully and as gratefully as they have heretofore remembered the
                            friendship of their first allies. Would such relations be worthless to
                            Portugal? Has she anything to fear in now laying the foundation for
                            them? If she should say that she is a small power, and her proceedings,
                            whatever they may be, are unimportant, you may answer that the state
                            which is first to correct the error which has been committed to our
                            injury will by that very procedure increase its moral influence and
                            importance in the family of nations, provided that it assume that stand
                            before we shall by our own efforts, without foreign favor, have regained
                            our accustomed and rightful position in the council of nations.</p>

                            received. While I agree with you that the means already taken by the
                            royal government to stimulate the production of cotton within the
                            Portuguese dominions are not such as are likely to be entirely
                            successful, I think the policy itself is one which commends itself to
                            general favor. It is very much desired that the world may never again be
                            forced to depend on African slavery, especially African slavery in
                            America, for the necessary staple of commerce.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your No. 118, covering a copy of a confidential despatch to
                            our minister at Vienna in regard to the proceedings of the French
                            government in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt of the prudence and propriety of your instruction
                            that we should abstain from discussion of the important questions
                            connected with the present situation of Mexico until a more appropriate
                            time and opportunity shall be presented by events which are now fast
                            taking shape and substance. In fact, the policy of our government in
                            reference to the states of the American continent speaks so emphatically
                            for itself, and is so generally known and understood in Europe, as to
                            require little of either explanation or representation on the part of
                            its diplomatic agents abroad.</p>
                        <p>That policy is founded upon justice and right, and involves various
                            obligations and duties. If foreign powers deliberately assail and
                            violate it, they cannot be ignorant of the results which must sooner or
                            later attend any such infraction. It is only natural that the people of
                            the United States should feel a deep concern for the fate of Mexico,
                            from immediate neighborhood, from the nature of her political
                            institutions, and from the common destiny which may be regarded, in the
                            not far future, as the hope and aspiration of both.</p>
                        <p>An occasion may possibly happen when it will be proper for that feeling
                            to be affirmed formally and distinctly, and we will be better prepared
                            to exercise an effective influence at the opportune moment by a becoming
                            reserve until it occurs. Intelligent and candid opinion will not
                            misjudge us for avoiding unnecessary complications that might weaken our
                            position, impair the value of our co-operation, and, perhaps, injure the
                            rightful claim of Mexico to the sympathy <pb facs="0298" n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274"/> and support of the friends of liberal institutions
                            and constitutional government everywhere. Despotic rulers and the
                            champions of absolutism have always regarded us with jealousy, disfavor,
                            and distrust. Their instruments will be apt to pursue the work of
                            misrepresentation until exhaustion succeeds to injustice. But if we
                            continue wise in our conduct towards Mexico, experience may serve to
                            correct some of these European errors, and to remove many delusions
                            concerning the policy, purposes, and power of the United States.</p>

                            now heir apparent to the throne) was celebrated yesterday with great
                            state and ceremony, and under the most favoring circumstances. All
                            business was suspended, and the streets through which the royal cortège
                            passed were tastefully decorated, while the presence of nine
                            ships-of-war of the Italian navy in the Tagus, ornamented with the flags
                            of all nations, made an effective pageant on the water. Our own
                            sloop-of-war, the St. Louis, in compliance with my suggestion, united in
                            the demonstration of respect and good feeling, and presented a fine
                            appearance, which attracted general commendation.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon the Italian Prince Carignan (cousin of King Victor
                            Emanuel) and Prince Amédée, (second son of the King,) who had been sent
                            here on a special mission of congratulation, received the diplomatic
                            body, and expressed to me a most friendly interest in our affairs.</p>
                        <p>The day closed by a state dinner at the palace of the Ajuda, with one
                            hundred and sixty covers, for the court, the diplomatic corps, the peers
                            and deputies of the kingdom, and the municipal and other bodies. I took
                            occasion to offer the President’s felicitations on the birth of the
                            Prince, in anticipation of the formal and customary communication, which
                            were kindly and becomingly answered by the King.</p>

                            those who had been specially invited to the ceremony, the diplomatic
                            corps, grandees of the realm, ministers of state, honorary and
                            effective, and noblemen.</p>
                        <p>The guard of honor in attendance on the royal cortege was composed of a
                            brigade of cavalry; the cavalry of the municipal guard was in attendance
                            on the new-born prince.</p>
                        <p>All those places which had been illuminated on the occasion of the birth,
                            again renewed, in a splendid manner, their lights and ornaments.</p>
                        <p>The public rejoicings could not be exceeded. The Portuguese people, ever
                            ready in giving sincere and loyal proofs of the love they bear to their
                            liberal dynasty, renewed these proofs in an enthusiastic manner on this
                            day. In the evening a vast concourse of people thronged all the
                            streets.</p>
                        <p>Don Pedro square, in spite of its size, was so crowded as to render it
                            difficult to move therein. Many popular private bands of music
                            circulated through the streets, followed by throngs, who frequently
                            cheered, with enthusiasm, these sacred objects of the happiness and love
                            of the Portuguese nation.</p>
                        <p>Up to the advanced hour of the night at which we are writing we are not
                            aware of any occurrence to mar the general joy and good feeling.</p>
                        <p>This is doubtless the greatest eulogy that can be passed on this
                            people.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The accompanying copy of a note from our
                            consul at Funchal has just reached this legation. The United States
                            sloop-of-war St. Louis is in port and undergoing repairs, after a cruise
                            of four months; but even if she were in a condition to put to sea
                            immediately, it is hardly necessary to say that a sailing ship is not
                            adapted to the service of pursuit, which is now required. In fact,
                            except for the moral effect of exhibiting our national flag in foreign
                            waters, the presence of this description of vessels is of no practical
                            value whatever. The piratical cruisers which have infested the ocean
                            during the last two years, destroying commerce and pillaging
                            promiscuously, have been encouraged by the impunity with which their
                            ravages have been perpetrated, and the knowledge of our imperfect means
                            of defence, as well as our inability to inflict proper punishment for
                            their criminal proceedings. It is quite probable the Georgia and others
                            of that class of cruisers will now renew their hostile operations on
                            this side of the Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>I am quite ignorant of the condition of the United States steamship
                            Kearsarge, which was recently at Brest for repairs, and which is the
                            only public vessel within reach at all fitted for the exigency; nor am I
                            informed of the orders under which her commander is acting; still I
                            shall at once communicate to him the facts which have come to my
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>It is quite desirable that the commanders of all the ships-of-war that
                            are sent to this and neighboring places for the protection of commerce
                            should keep the <pb facs="0300" n="276" xml:id="pg_276"/> diplomatic
                            agents informed of their movements, so as to give better efficiency to
                            the same; and I venture to suggest, as the result of some observation
                            and experience in this matter, that the naval orders to commanders
                            should be modified in regard to the limitation of their cruises within
                            particular parallels of latitude, and that they should be generally
                            instructed to go wherever the public interests demand their presence,
                            upon sufficient information from our diplomatic or consular
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>If a rendezvous or point of concentration were established, where the
                            condition and the movements of all the ships-of-war intended for these
                            and the neighboring waters could be ascertained at a moment of need, it
                            would be of substantial value. The want of a more perfect organization
                            and concert in the small naval force abroad has been and is still felt.
                            Stern and constant requirements at home have necessarily limited
                            attention to this point, but the present indications of a renewal of
                            outrages will doubtless attract notice to it immediately.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            from the Cape, having on board the captain and crew of the ship Bold

                            rebel cruiser Georgia, the recent depredations of which are reported in
                            my No. 236, boarded the British steamer Braganza, which arrived here
                            yesterday, on Sunday last, about one hundred and fifty miles from this
                            port. The Georgia was then proceeding to the northward and eastward.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of a telegram which I have now despatched to Captain
                            Winslow, of the United States steamer Kearsarge, at Brest. Being
                            entirely ignorant of the orders under which he is acting, and knowing of
                            the presence of the Florida at Brest, I did not feel at liberty to do
                            more than give this information, supposing also that he has discretion
                            or instructions for all such contingencies.</p>

                        <p>The sloop-of-war St. Louis is about to go to Cadiz for stores, which it
                            appears have been sent there. I beg to say, in this connexion, again,
                            what I have endeavored to impress before, that it is of the first
                            importance to the public interests that our naval force in Europe should
                            be so organized as to be available for these frequent emergencies. Cadiz
                            is a pleasant port, presenting various attractions, which tempt our
                            ships-of-war there much oftener than is needed for the good of the
                            service. It is frequently difficult of entrance, and all officers agree
                            that the opportunities of such intelligence as is wanted are far more
                            limited than here, where greater advantages in every respect are
                            offered. Our small strength abroad is thus frittered away by the want of
                            some simple and systematic plan for its regulation, and without which it
                            is really worse than useless, because large expense is incurred for its
                            maintenance while no substantial benefit is conferred.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Our consul at Gibraltar has just
                            telegraphed me, stating that the British schooner Emily Wilde was
                            recently boarded by the rebel cruiser Georgia near Cape Finisterre. This
                            information confirms that already communicated in my No. 237, and gives
                            just cause for apprehension that the piratical depredations of this
                            class of vessels will be renewed on this side of the Atlantic ocean.</p>
                        <p>I have also been notified by our agent in the Algarve district of this
                            kingdom of the appearance off the coast of two steamers within a short
                            time, the suspicious conduct of which led him to suppose that they
                            intended to take shelter or seek concealment among the secluded
                            indentations thereabouts, which are so favorable to, and which have been
                            notorious heretofore for, nefarious enterprises. But his precautions,
                            combined with a good understanding of the government officials, have
                            thus far prevented their entrance into any of the small ports of that
                            bad region. I have adopted, in concert with him, efficient measures to
                            be informed immediately of any important change of circumstances there,
                            and I will strive, should an unfavorable contingency occur, to act with
                            effect and promptitude here.</p>
                        <p>British vessels are now, and have been for some time back, carrying coals
                            to the remote harbors of the Azores islands, where limited vigilance is
                            necessarily <pb facs="0302" n="278" xml:id="pg_278"/> exercised for the
                            purpose of supplying steamers intending to run the blockade, and
                            doubtless others also equipped for depredatory hostilities. If the state
                            of the public service at home will admit of two fleet armed steamships
                            being sent to these waters, they, with the Kearsarge, under proper
                            direction, could readily be organized into a force sufficient not only
                            for the protection of our exposed commerce, but competent to inflict
                            punishment upon its criminal assailants. In such an event, it is
                            particularly desirable that they should not be restricted by arbitrary
                            limits in regard to their duties abroad, nor be absolutely independent
                            in their movements.</p>
                        <p>If I had felt myself authorized to do so, I should most certainly have
                            directed the Kearsarge to have proceeded forthwith to sea, upon being
                            informed of the presence of the cruiser Georgia—the more so, as she is
                            now said to be in excellent condition, and as the Florida, at Brest,
                            according to a letter of one of the officers of the Kearsarge, which was
                            submitted to my inspection, cannot be ready for sea before six weeks at
                            least. It is possible, however, that the commander of the Kearsarge may
                            have acted upon the information which I sent to him by telegraph a week
                            ago, and previously by letter, in regard to the operations of the
                            Georgia near Teneriffe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The French charge d’affaires delivered to
                            the King on the 12th instant a special letter to the Emperor, containing
                            an invitation to a congress of the states of Europe to be held at Paris,
                            having in view, generally, an adjustment of the Polish and other
                            questions which now menace the peace and political relations of this
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>A council of state was held on the 17th instant, at which it was
                            determined that Portugal should accept the invitation, and that fact was
                            formally made known this morning and communicated to Paris. As the
                            course of the different governments on this subject will, whether they
                            be large or small, excite interest, I telegraphed Mr. Adams to inform
                            the department of the decision.</p>
                        <p>The prompt response of Portugal has caused some surprise in those circles
                            which have been accustomed to regard her foreign policy as being either
                            inspired by the statesmen of Great Britain, or as resulting from the
                            ties of interest, intercourse, and alliance with that power.</p>
                        <p>It has, however, seemed to my mind as but a natural and logical result of
                            the proceedings which took place here last spring, when this government
                            united with those of England and France in making representations to
                            Russia concerning her internal administration in Poland, and took
                            occasion also to emphasize its sympathy by encouraging a popular
                            demonstration in that behalf, to which the King gave the sanction of his
                            personal presence. At that period of time the ministry was hard pressed
                            by the opposition, in and out of the Cortes, and its active zeal was,
                            perhaps, stimulated by the hope of disarming a combination which then
                            threatened its tenure of office.</p>
                        <p>The proposed congress is now much debated throughout Europe, according to
                            the partialities or prejudices which have been evoked by that sudden
                            suggestion. Every calm and intelligent observer of events must be
                            impressed with the conviction that a solution of the existing
                            difficulties can hardly be attained by any such conference, and simply
                            because those difficulties lie at the very foundations upon which
                            various governments rest. To uproot them is to prostrate if not to
                            extinguish other nationalities in the name and with the profession of
                            righting the oppressed, and of calling again into existence a nation
                            which was stricken from the map of Europe by the criminal participation
                            of some of the very powers which are now so vehement in condemning the
                            conduct of Russia.</p>
                        <p>Let the door of general discussion as to the state of Europe be once
                            thrown open, and the prediction may be confidently ventured that it can
                            never be again closed in peace. Uncertain and menacing as the present is
                            in all its aspects, agitated as the times are by the angry throes of a
                            coming commotion, and heavily charged as the political atmosphere may be
                            with storm clouds, still it is preferable to the almost certain and
                            fierce explosion which would follow the severe shock of jarring
                            elements, discordant rivalries, and revived animosities.</p>
                        <p>Hence, one of two alternatives seems to be probable—either that the
                            congress will never meet at all, or, if it does meet, that it will
                            separate leaving “confusion worse confounded.”</p>

                            in the report that one or more armed rebel cruisers had appeared in the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that within
                            the last few days two British steamers have put into this port
                            apparently for coals, which I very much suspect are destined to run the
                            blockade.</p>
                        <p>One of them, Presto, Captain T. J. Thomas, reported herself as coming in
                            from Cork, via Corunna. Her burden is 165 tons and 160 horse-power, with
                            a crew of twenty-six, all told.</p>
                        <p>I have strong reasons to suspect that her owner is, in part or in whole,
                            Mr. William S. Lindsay. This person, who is now here, has been on board
                            of her several times, and she is consigned to his acknowledged agents in
                            Lisbon, E. P. Bastos &amp; Co. The Presto has cleared, and starts to-day
                            for Bermuda. She brought no cargo, and carried away coals for the
                            voyage.</p>
                        <pb facs="0305" n="281" xml:id="pg_281"/>
                        <p>The other, the Triton, Captain J. W. Smith, came in on the 24th instant
                            from Liverpool, and is bound to the Havana. Her burden is 228 tons and
                            70 horse-power. Her crew consists of twenty-five men, all told. She
                            likewise brought no cargo; consigned herself to the consul, and goes
                            away in coal ballast.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing remarkable or characteristic in any of these steamers,
                            which are both screws, schooner rigged, and painted black all over.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, sir, your obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The distant colonial authorities of this
                            government have on various occasions, and in different ways, thrown
                            impediments in the way of our commerce, so as to affect injuriously and
                            unjustly numbers of enterprising merchants, who find themselves without
                            any remedy on the spot, and who have no other mode of redress but by
                            protest against oppressive exactions, and through an appeal to the
                            representative of the United States at Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>Not wishing to subject the department, which is already sufficiently
                            burdened. with more important affairs, to the necessity of giving
                            instructions in plain cases admitting of little, if any doubt, and in
                            order also to avoid delay, I have, of my own accord, addressed the
                            minister of foreign affairs on these subjects, as they were brought to
                            my notice, and in some instances with the desired effect. Several cases
                            are now pending which involve a simple interpretation of parts of our
                            treaty with Portugal and the commercial rights under it, as they have
                            been defined by usage in his Majesty’s colonies, and by the practice of
                            other nations.</p>
                        <p>I deem it proper to submit to your inspection the copy of a note which I
                            have just addressed to the Duke de Soule in one of the most important of
                            these cases, which in principle affects a large American interest
                            engaged in legitimate trade with the coast of Africa.</p>
                        <p>The local authorities are much too often high-handed and arbitrary in
                            their proceedings, and it was quite necessary that his Majesty’s
                            government should know frankly that such was the estimation of their
                            conduct, in order to produce any effect whatever upon their superiors
                            here, who are almost habitually inclined to depreciate the value of
                            these matters.</p>

                            facts:</p>
                        <p>The American brig Morning Light sailed from Boston in the month of
                            January last for St. Paul de Loanda and a market, with a full cargo of
                            American merchandise consigned to A. A. Silva &amp; Brothers, American
                            merchants; her manifest was officially certified to that effect by the
                            Portuguese consul at Boston. Upon arriving at St. Paul de Loanda part of
                            the cargo was disposed of and discharged; the brig then proceeded to the
                            island of St. Helena with a manifest for the remaining portion of the
                            cargo furnished by the Portuguese collector of the customs at St. Paul
                            de Loanda. At St. Helena some of the remaining cargo was discharged, and
                            the rest was returned to St. Paul de Loanda, being certified by the
                            Portuguese consul at St. Helena as forming a part of the original
                            manifest, which in fact had never been taken from the ship, and which
                            was constantly covered by the flag of the United States, and verified as
                            American merchandise by the Portuguese officials throughout.</p>

                            demanded and received full duty upon the remainder of the cargo on the
                            alleged ground that the continuation of the voyage to St. Helena
                            divested the ship of the reciprocal right which American merchandise
                            acquired under the treaty of commerce, that is to say, a reduction of
                            one-third of the regular duty under the clause which places American
                            commerce on the footing of “the most favored nations.”</p>
                        <p>The governor general at St. Paul de Loanda, who assumed to make this
                            decision in contravention of what, I am advised, was the practice under
                            his predecessor, Governor Amaral, admits, in a note to the commercial
                            agent of the United States, that the case in question is not positively
                            determined by law, and therefore that he refers the protest which that
                            officer made on behalf of the merchants to the superior authority at
                            Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>This simple statement of the facts would seem almost sufficient in itself
                            to justify a revision of the governor’s decision by his Majesty’s
                            government. The treaty of commerce confers reciprocal privileges
                            intended to promote trade between the two countries, and not to
                            interrupt it by far-fetched and technical constructions violative of the
                            spirit and purpose of that high obligation. In the particular case under
                            consideration the utmost pains were taken to comply strictly and
                            faithfully with the letter and intention of the treaty. The original
                            manifest of the merchandise was certified by his Majesty’s consul at
                            Boston; when part of the cargo was discharged at St. Paul de Loanda the
                            remainder was certified by his Majesty’s collector at that port; and,
                            finally, when another portion of the same cargo was discharged at St.
                            Helena the rest of the cargo was again certified by his Majesty’s consul
                            there as being the residue of the original manifest. From first to last
                            it preserved the same nationality, was protected by the same flag, and
                            was verified as such by his Majesty’s officers. No attempt is made to
                            dispute these facts, but the governor general claims substantially that
                            the incidental voyage to St. Helena changed the whole character of the
                            vessel and cargo, and, therefore, subjected the merchandise to an
                            invidious discrimination, which the treaty of commerce was made to
                            provide against. He treats this vessel as if she had taken in a new
                            cargo at a foreign port, and had appeared at St. Paul de Loanda in that
                            aspect only. In such a case his decision would have been justified. In
                            the present one it is inconsistent with reason and with the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The course of trade between the United States and his Majesty’s
                            possessions in Africa is for ships to clear with assorted merchandise
                            for a port like St. Paul de Loanda and a market. The reason of this is
                            that there is not usually demand enough for a whole cargo at any one of
                            the African ports. This voyage is long and attended with hazards. If by
                            stress of weather, or by other causes, <pb facs="0307" n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283"/> a ship regularly engaged in this commerce should
                            be driven into an intermediate foreign port, her cargo under the
                            governor’s decree would be liable to an increase duty from that cause
                            only, for the principle is precisely the same, since he rests the case
                            of the Morning Light upon the ground that the vessel had entered a
                            foreign port, and it is not pretended that the remaining cargo had been
                            removed or renewed.</p>
                        <p>I submit, with all respect, that the governor general has no power to
                            denationalize American commerce in this arbitrary manner, and I feel
                            confident that his proceeding will not be sustained.</p>
                        <p>The commerce between various ports in the United States and the African
                            possessions of his Majesty’s government has been steadily increasing for
                            years past, and is now of importance to both sides. Its continued
                            prosperity depends, to a great extent, upon the fair and upright conduct
                            of officials who are far removed from the immediate supervision of the
                            central government. Subordinates elsewhere have, by capricious and
                            extreme measures, broken up an American trade in one of her Majesty’s
                            colonies which was rapidly growing into value, and a similar result is
                            now threatened at Loanda by a system of illiberal and harsh dealing on
                            the part of the local authorities towards American merchants.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew the assurances of my most
                            distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I take occasion per this steamer to inform
                            you that a screw steam vessel called the Modgo, and pretending to be a
                            yacht, arrived here a day or two ago from Falmouth, and is still in
                            port. She has no <hi rend="italic">look</hi> of a yacht, but rather of a
                            strong serviceable brigantine sailing vessel, with steam power added.
                            She looks rather rough and untidy, being a wooden vessel, and has a
                            large house on deck, apparently a temporary fixture; she has, also, four
                            small boat swivel-guns mounted <hi rend="italic">on</hi> her bulwarks.
                            Her destination is given out as Porto Cabello, and she manifests four
                            passengers, one of whom is a lady. I have as yet found no one who knows
                            who they are, and the affair looks sufficiently mysterious to lead me to
                            advise you of it, and to suggest that inquiries be made <pb facs="0308"
                                n="284" xml:id="pg_284"/> through our consuls at Falmouth, Plymouth,
                            and Portsmouth, and a lookout be kept for her in West India waters. She
                            might be made a very troublesome little cruiser by pitching the
                            deck-house overboard and mounting a pivot-gun in its place.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that the craft is, <hi rend="italic">as yet,</hi> prepared
                            for such work, but it seems to me that she might be. She is about a 150
                            tons, brigantine, or brig, schooner-rig—stern rather old style, having
                            been ornamented once with carving and gilding, which is now painted out;
                            semi-clipper bow, with a little gilding; very square yards; black funnel
                            close before mainmast; quarter-boats slung pretty high, and one of them
                            varnished wood-color.</p>
                        <p>We have had for some time in port the Dublin steamer Man, which has
                            procured coal at last on <hi rend="italic">bottomry</hi> bond, and will
                            leave to-day probably for Nassau. Last night the fine paddle-steamer
                            Nutfield, only a little over four days from Plymouth—one of the quickest
                            trips on record—arrived here. She is about the size of the famous
                            Calypso, and may prove as troublesome a customer.</p>

                                committed to their care by public confidence and the law of the
                                state. In commending thus the legislative task of the session about
                                to be opened, I affectionately salute the representatives of the
                                nation, and cordially associate my wishes to the developments of
                                their serious duties.</p>
                            <p>During the six months which have elapsed since the closing of the
                                previous session it hath pleased Divine Providence to fill up the
                                measure of my domestic happiness, and at the same time to offer to
                                my country and its institutions a hope and an assurance of
                                stability. The rejoicings which the birth of the prince royal, Don
                                Carlos, occasioned in my household and in the country, in my <pb
                                    facs="0309" n="285" xml:id="pg_285"/> family as a man, and in my
                                family as a king, were much enhanced by the agreeable surprise and
                                unexpected visit of the august Empress of the French, as well as by
                                the presence of the most serene princes of the royal house of Italy,
                                their highnesses the Prince de Carignan and the Duke de Aosta.</p>
                            <p>During my recent visit to a part of the northern provinces the
                                expressive and enduring proofs of love manifested everywhere by the
                                people towards me and my much loved spouse, whilst overflowing my
                                soul with the purest satisfaction, made me feel that it is my duty
                                to reciprocate such loyal sentiments by constant care and
                                solicitude. To this end I pray to God, and for this I hope that the
                                supreme wisdom will inspire me, and the supreme strength will uphold
                                me, within the sphere of my duties as constitutional king.</p>
                            <p>I continue to receive from the sovereigns, my allies, evident proofs
                                of a good understanding and friendship, thus drawing closer together
                                the relations between Portugal and the respective powers.</p>
                            <p>From his Majesty the Emperor of the French an invitation was sent, to
                                the effect that Portugal take a part in a European congress destined
                                to prevent war— a new and most noble principle, which, whatever may
                                now be the result, unquestionably inaugurates a marked progress in
                                international policy.</p>
                            <p>It being my duty to reply to the gracious and flattering letter of
                                the Emperor, and having previously consulted the council of state in
                                scrupulous observance of the constitution, I accepted, without
                                hesitation, under the conviction that if the right of power belongs
                                to all predominating nations, the force of right and law alone
                                belongs to all nations which possess a lesser predominating
                                power.</p>
                            <p>The necessary works for following up the railway lines undertaken in
                                the north and south have been carried on with activity and
                                perseverance, and the conclusion thereof will be effected very
                                soon.</p>
                            <p>In order to realize these works, to carry on the ordinary roads, to
                                increase naval constructions, to accelerate other works of undoubted
                                public utility, to comply, in fine, with so many although so very
                                useful undertakings, a loan of £2,500,000 sterling, nominal, was
                                raised in the London market under more advantageous conditions than
                                any other previous operation of a like nature, and these conditions,
                                together with the ready concurrence of capital thereto, fully show
                                the marked improvement in public credit.</p>
                            <p>The general accounts of the state have been organized and regulated,
                                an essential step towards effecting the auditing of the financial
                                operations of the government, and this will, no doubt, tend to
                                consolidate public credit.</p>
                            <p>All the legislation relating to the sale of national property,
                                remission, and sales of land, rent, and capitalization, has been
                                collected into a code.</p>
                            <p>The organizing of the army has been decreed, as well as the military
                                administration, and all schools dependent on the war department.</p>
                            <p>On the 30th December last the works for the fortifications of Lisbon
                                were inaugurated at the hill of Monsanto.</p>
                            <p>The criminal registry has been organized in all the colonies; the
                                parochial registry was established, and in Angola a reform was
                                introduced in the administration of the property of deceased and
                                absentees.</p>
                            <p>The committee named to revise the project of a general regulation of
                                the law of mortgage continues its task in an assiduous manner, and
                                to complete its important investigations and studies much time and
                                attention will necessarily be required.</p>
                            <p>My government will present to you the budget of receipts and
                                expenditure of the state, including all innovations suggested by
                                experience, and with a division of the income and expenses into
                                ordinary and extraordinary, thus allowing a more clear and better
                                appreciation of the same, without introducing any indefinite
                                authority or power to raise funds and submitting to parliamentary
                                vote the fixing of the receipts and expenses of all kinds. By this
                                budget you <pb facs="0310" n="286" xml:id="pg_286"/> will observe
                                that, notwithstanding the diminution of 10 per cent. in the
                                deduction on the pay of public employés, the ordinary income fully
                                covers the ordinary expenses, thus attesting a marked improvement in
                                the financial conditions of the country.</p>
                            <p>The budget for the colonial provinces, made up as much as possible
                                under the same system and principles, will be ready in a short time,
                                it now only awaiting the work of the local juntas, which has been
                                delayed by the great distances from the kingdom.</p>
                            <p>Besides the several important subjects which remained pending since
                                the last session, especially such as refer to public instruction,
                                administration, and police, all which will no doubt receive the
                                benefit of your enlightened zeal and cooperation, the ministers of
                                the respective departments will submit to you, among other measures,
                                the proposals for the abolition and substitution of the pain of
                                death, and the corresponding modification in the penal code; the
                                reform in the commercial code with regard to the form of process;
                                for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, establishing a free
                                manufacture and sale in the kingdom and its culture in the Azores
                                and Madeira islands; for improvement in sanitary laws; for a reform
                                in sundry branches of public instruction; for the reorganization of
                                public charities’; for the remodelling of the consulates of the
                                empire of Brazil; for a reform in the law of mines; for a reduction
                                of the tariff of telegraphs; for a reform in the police service of
                                the ports and on the coasts; for modifying the naval recruiting; for
                                the approval of a national colonial bank; to regulate the pensioning
                                of colonial employés; to improve the condition of the same whilst in
                                actual service; for sundry reforms concerning the better application
                                of public instruction in those provissions; for the attorney
                                generalship at Macao, and sundry other special measures in the
                                colonial provinces.</p>
                            <p>The government will likewise render you an account of the use made of
                                the several authorizations confided to it, and will submit, for your
                                approval, the decrees relating to the colonies, which were published
                                in virtue of the additional act of the charter.</p>
                            <p>I trust that with the Divine help you will accord all your care and
                                patriotic attention to the public requirements, and to the
                                examination of the grave questions of economy and administration
                                which require to be enlightened and decided upon, for the honor of
                                the nation, for the credit of our institutions, for the improvement
                                and aggrandizement of our country, and for the glory and prosperity
                                of this nation so worthy of all solicitude.</p>
                            <p>The session is hereby opened.</p>

                            Duke de Soulé, in answer to one which I addressed to him on the 14th
                            instant, in reference to the army of piratical cruisers in Portuguese
                            ports, was only received last night, though dated on the 16th
                            instant.</p>
                        <p>This reply necessarily precludes any further representation on my part
                            to. his Majesty’s government at the present point of time; but if an
                            occasion should occur, as I hope it may not, I shall not hesitate to
                            discharge the duty which a change of circumstances may require.</p>
                        <p>If the authorities of the island now act in good faith and with
                            sufficient resolution, the armed cruisers which seek those remote ports
                            for military supplies will be foiled in their iniquitous designs, and
                            our commerce will be spared a renewal of the criminal depredations to
                            which it has been heretofore subjected.</p>

                        <p>In order to provide as much actual assistance as is at my disposal here
                            to second the moral efforts of the government in affording the desired
                            protection, I have requested the United States sloop-of-war St. Louis to
                            sail immediately for the Azores and. for Teneriffe, with a view of
                            intercepting the cruisers in question.</p>
                        <p>These measures of precaution and prudence exhaust all the resources which
                            may be commanded for this emergency; and if they are less perfect than
                            they should be, the inadequacy may not be attributed to any want of
                            vigilance or care on the part of the legation, for it has been my duty
                            to make repeated suggestions, derived from actual experience, concerning
                            the indifferent organization of our small naval force in Europe, in the
                            hope that they might attract the attention of the proper department
                            sufficiently to correct, at least, those manifest imperfections which
                            have produced injurious results.</p>
                        <p>It is not difficult to understand why, with the stern and urgent demands
                            at home, this naval force has not been augmented, but the same reason
                            would not seem to apply to an increase of its efficiency by means of a
                            more thorough and practicable disposition of the ships already in
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>I have had the honor of receiving the note which you were pleased to
                            address me under date of the 14th instant, making known to me the
                            information you had received, that the English bark Agrippina was
                            carrying to the Azores a cargo of munitions of war for the supply of
                            confederate cruisers.</p>
                        <p>Being thus apprised of the contents of your aforesaid note, it is my duty
                            to inform you that, under this date, I address the ministers of the
                            interior, finance, war, and navy departments, in order that, with all
                            urgent speed, they may adopt the most energetic measures to prevent the
                            furnishing of such articles to confederate vessels.</p>
                        <p>I avail of this opportunity to renew the assurances of my most

                        <p>On the contrary, it is desirable that she should proceed immediately to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> A formidable iron-clad squadron of her
                            Britannic Majesty’s service, under the command of Rear-Admiral Dacres,
                            is now lying in the Tagus, and attracts much notice. Its stay here will
                            be determined by the turn of events in northern Europe.</p>
                        <p>It gives me pleasure to state, in view of an unpleasant occurrence last
                            year, that the best feeling exists between the officers and seamen of
                            that squadron and those of our own ship, the St. Louis; and that every
                            mark of official and personal courtesy has been shown by the former, and
                            responded to by the latter, to extinguish the recollection of an
                            incident which, for no fault of the British admiral, occasioned much bad
                            blood at the time.</p>
                        <p>As illustrative of this friendly disposition it may be mentioned that our
                            consul called at the admiral’s ship a few days since to make that
                            officer a personal visit of acquaintance, but not finding him left a
                            card, without even going on board. The American flag was immediately
                            hoisted and saluted with appropriate honors.</p>
                        <p>To myself personally every facility for examining these interesting ships
                            has been extended, with such a cordiality and marked respect to the
                            legation that I should be remiss in duty in not presenting the fact to
                            the notice of the department. And in doing so I ought to add that the
                            British minister here, Sir Arthur C. Magenis, has always manifested
                            towards me a spirit of candor, kindness, and friendship, which, with our
                            radical difference of political views, has impressed me in the manner
                            which such high-minded conduct should do a proper man. Indeed I may say
                            that every British official at Lisbon, without exception, has exhibited
                            the same good will, and under circumstances which gave such tokens
                            increased value in my estimation.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            which accompanies it, that the hope and confidence which I ventured to
                            express in my No. 250 as to the effect of a note addressed to him on the
                            14th instant, regarding the movement and designs of certain piratical
                            cruisers, were not merely speculative. This government seems to have
                            been awakened to a sense of its responsibility, and the consequences
                            that might result from a neglect of plain and upright duty.</p>
                        <p>A great point will be gained if these hostile cruisers can be effectually
                            shut out of the retreats which they seek at the mid-ocean islands, to
                            recruit and equip for the destruction of our commerce, and I believe
                            this last measure will be effective for that purpose. But if any other
                            proceeding or precaution shall be suggested by experience as necessary,
                            it will be my duty to urge it promptly and firmly.</p>

                            for supplying the confederate cruisers, it is my duty to inform you that
                            the minister of the interior has advised me, in his communication of the
                            20th instant, as having forwarded, on that same date, to the civil
                            governors of the districts of the Azores and Madeira, a portario, of
                            which a copy will be found enclosed.</p>
                        <p>By the contents thereof you will perceive that proper instructions have
                            been furnished to the aforesaid authorities to enable them to thwart the
                            intentions and speculations of all corsairs inimical to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>These same orders may, for greater speed, be forwarded by the corvette
                            St. Louis, as you propose; and to this end I have the honor of
                            transmitting the same to you to be sent to their destination.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew the assurance of my most

                        <p>The enclosed authentic copy of a note from the minister of the United
                            States of America at this court having made known that the English hark
                            Agrippina contemplates carrying to the Azores a cargo of munitions of
                            war for supplying confederate cruisers, which are to go there to receive
                            them, in order to continue their depredations on the commerce of the
                            United States in the same manner as the aforesaid bark did before, in
                            1862, in the Bay of Angra; and it being further made known that the
                            parties implicated in these nefarious undertakings propose to establish
                            a regular depot in one or more of the smaller ports in the said islands,
                            with the view of organizing therein armed expeditions hostile to the
                            aforesaid United States, his Majesty the King desires that a knowledge
                            of the above be communicated to the civil governor of the district of
                            Angra de Heroismo, and ordains that, taking into his most serious
                            consideration the contents of the above-mentioned note, and the
                            reclamation therein contained, the said civil governor shall adopt all
                            such measures as may be necessary to completely put a stop to the
                            aforesaid designs and intentions on the part of the enemies of said
                            United States; and for this purpose he is to co-operate with the
                            directors of custom-houses and captains of ports within the district
                            under his charge, so as to act with a mutual accord, to which effect
                            orders, with strong recommendation, have been sent to them through the
                            respective departments. An immediate account is to be rendered, through
                            this department, of all that may be done or put into practice on this
                            subject, with the understanding that his Majesty makes the civil
                            governor and his subordinates responsible for any neglect or omission in
                            such a grave and delicate affair.</p>

                            energetically invoked to prevent rebel cruisers from arming or equipping

                        <p>I have reason to know, also, that his Majesty’s fine war steamer the

                            to these assurances, which, besides being a gratifying fact to me in my
                            official capacity, is a source of great personal satisfaction, because
                            it was intended as a substantial token of good will in both

                            <p>I have the honor of informing you, in addition to my notes of 23d
                                instant, that the minister of finance informs me, in a communication
                                of the 20th instant, that on the same day the most positive orders
                                were being sent to the directors of custom-houses in the Azores
                                islands, to the effect of their adopting, under the severest
                                responsibility, all. such measures as may be within their reach, to
                                prevent confederate vessels from supplying themselves with munitions
                                of war in the customs-ports of said archipelago.</p>
                            <p>It is my duty further to inform you that the minister of war has
                                advised me, under that same date, that notwithstanding the orders
                                already transmitted to the general commanding the 10th military
                                division, which were communicated to you on the 2d December, 1862,
                                he now again recommends the aforesaid general to employ the utmost
                                vigilance, and to give his most positive orders, so as, by
                                co-operating with all the other local authorities, to frustrate all
                                plans and attempts of the confederates, and thus maintain a vigorous
                                compliance with the decree of July 29, 1861.</p>
                            <p>I renew on this occasion the assurances of my most distinguished

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>From information communicated to this
                            legation, there is reason to apprehend that a rendezvous has been
                            appointed at the Azores or other islands of this kingdom between certain
                            rebel cruisers now in France and various vessels under the British flag,
                            one of which is called the bark Agrippina, for the purpose of receiving
                            military supplies with a view of renewing depredations upon the commerce
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>That fact has been made known to his Majesty’s government, by which
                            efficient steps have been taken to prevent the menaced outrages.</p>
                        <p>In order that you may be more fully informed of the dispositions
                            entertained here, and thus be better prepared to co-operate more
                            effectively and harmoniously with the local authorities, I transmit
                            herewith a copy of a royal portaria on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The necessity of frank and cordial concert with all the authorities in
                            regard to suspicious vessels is enjoined by the peculiar circumstances
                            of the situation, by duty to our own government, and by good faith
                            towards as well as respect for that of his Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The Mindello, a Portuguese war steamer, has been despatched to the
                            islands to assist in carrying out these measures, and to aid in giving
                            the desired protection. It is to be hoped that every proper courtesy
                            will be extended to the officers of that ship by the representatives of
                            the United States at all the ports where she may touch, so as to testify
                            the appreciation of our government for an act of exceptional zeal and
                            good will in behalf of the interests of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>All agents of the United States connected with your consulate should be
                            forthwith directed to exercise unusual vigilance, and to report every
                            fact in any way bearing upon the matter of instruction. It is also
                            desirable that you should make known promptly to this legation whatever
                            information may be received.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>My No. 245, of the 20th of December,
                            presented to your view, by means of the copy of a note which I had
                            addressed to the Duke de Soulé, various embarrassments to which our
                            trade with the African ports of this kingdom had been subjected in
                            consequence of certain prejudicial discriminations imposed by the
                            provincial authorities of his Majesty’s government in levying duties
                            upon American merchandise.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the minister for foreign affairs informed me that the subject
                            would be referred to the general council of the customs at Lisbon to
                            determine upon the construction to be given to that clause of our treaty
                            under which this question had arisen, I felt it necessary and proper to
                            address him a second note, of which a copy is now transmitted, setting
                            forth very plainly that if the rigid and forced interpretation adopted
                            by the provincial authorities to the detriment of our commerce was
                            sustained, we should be obliged to apply a similar rule to the
                            production and manufactures of Portugal.</p>
                        <p>I have now the pleasure to communicate a note from the Duke de Soulé, in
                            which he informs me that the general council of the customs has given a
                            decision conforming to the views expressed by, and the representations
                            made from, this legation, and that two-thirds of the full duty only will
                            be assessed upon all merchandise from the United States which may be
                            entitled to claim that advantage under the treaty as it is now clearly
                            understood.</p>
                        <p>This decision is of importance to large interests in the New England
                            States connected with the regular and legitimate African trade, and
                            which have been much deranged for a year past by the proceedings of
                            officials who applied the revenue regulations illiberally and
                            arbitrarily. A fresh and favorable impulse will now be given to
                            enterprise in that direction by the removal of obstacles which crippled
                            the expansive energies of commerce.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            reception of your note of the 28th instant, stating that the subject of
                            a representation made by me on the 18th instant had been referred to a
                            general council of the customs, and is now under deliberation.</p>
                        <p>It is proper for me to observe in this connexion, in order that the
                            council of customs may fully consider all the bearings of the question,
                            that if the decision of the authorities at Loando be sustained, the
                            government of the United States will be constrained, in self-defence, to
                            apply an equally rigid rule to the productions and merchandise of
                            Portugal which now enter into the trade between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The forced technical construction of the treaty by the authorities at
                            Loando differs from the interpretation and practice heretofore adopted
                            at the same place, and not only divests the certificates of Portuguese
                            consuls of any substantial value, but attempts also to deprive American
                            commerce of the benefits which it is entitled to enjoy under the treaty,
                            and which have not been disputed until now.</p>

                            duty, according to sections 2d and 7th of article 1st of the tariff at
                            said custom-house, and in conformity to the treaty between Portugal and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>His Majesty’s government has commenced a
                            system of military works and lines for the protection of Lisbon, based
                            upon plans which are understood to have been sketched out by the late
                            Duke of Wellington during his memorable peninsular campaign. Their
                            completion will involve a cost of several millions of dollars, which is
                            no inconsiderable sum for a small kingdom where the current expenses
                            exceed the regular revenues, and frequent loans are required to offset
                            constantly augmenting deficits.</p>
                        <p>Portugal is at peace with all the world, and has every reason and
                            interest to preserve that condition, for aside from the civil conflicts
                            which destroyed a former prosperity, her territory was made the theatre
                            of war between great rival powers which contended for supremacy or for
                            control on this part of the peninsula. These large works have doubtless
                            been undertaken to provide means of defence against dangers which are
                            indirectly threatened by the disturbed state of Europe, and from the
                            apprehension that, sooner or later, the war which now rages on the far
                            north may by a sudden turn of events be extended to, or by chance burst

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The enclosed extracts from an official
                            letter addressed to me by Commander Preble, of the United States steamer
                            St. Louis, will explain themselves.</p>
                        <p>Private letters, of four days later date, inform me that the rebel
                            cruiser Florida left Funchal clandestinely on the night of the 29th of
                            February, and was seen <pb facs="0321" n="297" xml:id="pg_297"/> the
                            next day in the neighborhood of the island, when the St. Louis put to
                            sea. It is to be presumed, as the rebel did not desire an engagement,
                            that he took advantage of his steam-power to escape.</p>
                        <p>It appears, from the statement of Commander Preble, that the Florida
                            entered Funchal bay on the 28th of February, after a cruise of eighteen
                            days from Brest, short of coal, water, bread, &amp;c., and that a
                            concerted arrangement had been made with an English merchant named
                            Blandy to furnish her with one hundred and ten tons of coal. At first
                            the governor of the island would not permit any coal to be supplied, but
                            after various conferences he agreed to allow twenty tons to be taken on
                            board, and the Florida left Funchal with that limited provision,
                            probably to seek a more hospitable port.</p>
                        <p>I take it for granted, if a question were to be raised on this subject,
                            which cannot now be done for the want of official and precise
                            information, that the governor will claim to justify his action in the
                            premises upon the ground that the ease was included in the category
                            provided for by the royal proclamation of July 29, 1861, which excepts
                            from the rule therein prescribed “cases of overruling necessity, <hi
                                rend="italic">(force majeure,)</hi> in which, according to the laws
                            of nations, hospitality is indispensable.” In any event, I shall esteem
                            it to be my duty to state the facts to the minister of foreign affairs
                            at the first opportunity which may be offered for that purpose.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The rebel steamer Florida, Morris
                            commander, arrived here on the night before the last, reporting as
                            eighteen days from Brest, and requiring supplies of coals, water, bread,
                            &amp;c. Mr. Blandy, an English merchant, had engaged to furnish 110 tons
                            of coals, but the governor forbade her being supplied with either coals
                            or provisions. Last night there was an attempt to coal her
                            clandestinely, which I ascertained and reported to Mr. Bayman, acting
                            consul. We had a long interview with the governor and stopped it; two
                            boats were loaded and are now afloat, watched by police boats.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bayman writes me this morning that the governor, acting on <hi
                                rend="italic">old instructions</hi>—not the recent ones—had decided
                            to give the Florida sixty tons of coals, since reduced to twenty, but I
                            am not sure that he will adhere to this.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The rebel commander says his mission is to destroy our commerce, not to
                            fight, and that he cannot afford to risk the chances of injury to his
                            machinery. I have, therefore, little hopes of bringing her to action
                            with my canvas wings, though I shall follow her to sea, if practicable,
                            and try. He will probably go to sea in the morning calms, before the
                            land breeze sets in. If not allowed to coal here I think he will go to
                            Teneriffe, where the Georgia was coaled last October, and where I hope
                            he may fall in with the Sacramento. We left her at Fayal, to sail as
                            soon as coaled, and she would probably be detained at Santa Cruz to
                            overhaul her engines. The rebels were offering $50 advance yesterday for
                            additions to the crew.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>A paragraph appeared in one of the
                            principal papers to-day of which the following is a translation:</p>
                        <p>“According to the Aurora dos Açores of the 5th of March an English
                            schooner coming from the island of St. Mary’s reports that a vessel was
                            set on fire by a steamer presumed to be the Florida, or Alabama, and
                            supposed to be the same which, on the 1st instant, passed within sight
                            of the harbor.”</p>
                        <p>I fear it will turn out that the corsair Florida, which left Funchal on
                            the night of the 29th February, has been renewing her depredations, and
                            that at least one other victim has been added to the number of American
                            ships which have been destroyed by this and other piratical
                            cruisers.</p>
                        <p>Unless energetic measures be adopted there is too much reason to believe
                            that the catalogue will be soon and largely augmented.</p>

                            the fact that the commander of the Florida was consistent in his

                            And although he succeeded in a very fractional degree, this experience

                            the 28th ultimo. I then called on the governor; he said that the Florida
                            would be ordered to leave <pb facs="0323" n="299" xml:id="pg_299"/>
                            within twenty-four hours, and would not be allowed to take any coal;
                            that any change in his then determination would be at once communicated
                            to me. About eight o’clock that night I was informed that coal was ready
                            in boats to go off to the Florida; on my way to ascertain this I met a
                            messenger from the governor requesting my presence; I went to the
                            castle, and was then told by the governor that the commander of the
                            Florida, one Morris, stated that he had only seven tons of coal on
                            board, barely enough for cooking purposes, and that to take the vessel
                            to another part he required 110 tons, also bread and water. The governor
                            suggested that some one should go on board to verify this statement.
                            Morris declined, and I have reason to believe, from subsequent
                            information, that instead of seven tons there were seventy-five tons of
                            coal on board. The governor, taking the statement made by Morris on
                            honor, proposed to give him sixty tons of coal, water and bread,
                            ordering the Florida to leave the next day, asking my acquiesence, (<hi
                                rend="italic">d’accord.</hi>) My reply was that I could not agree to
                            the supply of one ton of coal under any circumstances; that the Florida
                            could sail out of port as readily as any other ship. With regard to
                            water and bread, I begged to remark that the United States government
                            had, from the outset of the domestic troubles, followed a most humane,
                            generous policy in their efforts to crush the most unprovoked rebellion
                            known in the history of the world, offering a marked contrast to the
                            savage ferocity that had characterized the conduct of the rebels.
                            Mindful of this, I would not object to the supply of bread, though in
                            strict justice even these ought to be denied to men roaming over the
                            ocean solely to destroy unarmed vessels.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently the governor decided to allow the Florida to receive twenty
                            tons of coal, notwithstanding my objections. The foregoing contains the
                            main points of our conversation. I quite believe that the governor was
                            anxious to send the Florida away without more aid than he considered
                            necessary to enable the vessel to depart.</p>
                        <p>The alleged attempt to coal the Florida clandestinely cannot be proved;
                            three boats were loaded with about twenty-one tons of coal, moored to a
                            buoy, waiting leave to be sent alongside the Florida—so say the owners.
                            I saw the boats so moored, and know that no coal went off till leave was
                            granted, and then only the twenty tons.</p>
                        <p>The Florida anchored east of the St. Louis; got away during the night of
                            the 29th February; it was very dark, and the wind blowing hard from the
                            west.</p>
                        <p>The St. Louis left on the morning of the 1st March. The Julia and
                            Constance, steamers, well-known blockade runners, are in port in a leaky
                            condition, awaiting orders.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch, No. 129, and to express my acknowledgments for
                            the courteous and complimentary terms in which you have conveyed the
                            “President’s approval and commendation” of my conduct in the matter of
                            the apprehended equipment of certain rebel cruisers in Portuguese
                            ports.</p>
                        <pb facs="0324" n="300" xml:id="pg_300"/>
                        <p>Your suggestion of a reconsideration of the policy of his Most Faithful
                            Majesty’s government in regard to our unhappy strife involves various
                            difficulties which deserve to be well considered before moving in that
                            direction. The first duty to which I addressed myself, after entering
                            upon this mission, was to procure a proclamation prohibiting the
                            insurgents from bringing prizes into Portuguese ports, or using them for
                            hostile purposes against the commerce and interests of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Although that proclamation was issued soon after the leading and several
                            of the minor powers had conceded belligerent rights to the insurgents,
                            and although Portugal, from her ancient alliances, her necessities, and
                            her traditions, has been accustomed to regard such examples as almost
                            obligatory upon her own action, that document stopped far short of the
                            length to which the others had gone. It is true that the proclamation
                            was not in all respects what I desired it should be in terms, but it is
                            certainly more friendly in fact, more liberal in substance, and more
                            becoming in form, than that of any other government, as will be readily
                            seen by instituting a comparison. Neither the moral nor the material
                            influence of Portugal has been thrown into the scale before the world to
                            lift up a revolutionary party to the rights and dignity of a belligerent
                            power, and no restriction of any kind has been imposed upon our
                            ships-of-war. On the contrary, they have been welcomed by the
                            authorities of this kingdom everywhere with respect and good feeling,
                            and recently, upon an important occasion, in a manner that deserves our
                            cordial recognition.</p>
                        <p>To the extent of good dispositions and of limited resources we have had
                            all the advantage of the effective influence of this government, even
                            when it was pressed hard from without, when suffering much for the loss
                            of an accustomed commerce within, and, I may add, whilst a fabricated
                            and selfish European opinion was brought to bear strongly against our
                            cause and country.</p>
                        <p>It is my foremost desire, as it is my greatest ambition, in the position
                            which I now occupy, that Portugal should not give even the slight
                            sanction of a nominal neutrality to the enemies of free institutions,
                            who, in this enlightened century, have inaugurated the most terrible of
                            civil wars, with its horrid train of blood and carnage, to plant more
                            deeply the foundations of a despotic oligarchy, to overthrow the noblest
                            work of human wisdom in the way of free government, and to arrest the
                            progress of a mighty social development, because it threatened their too
                            long continued political ascendency.</p>
                        <p>You may be quite sure that no effort will be spared on my part to attain
                            that object whenever a fitting opportunity may be presented, but I shall
                            regard any agitation of the subject, at this particular time, not only
                            inopportune, but rather calculated to defeat than to aid the purpose.
                            There are various reasons for this opinion, with which it is unnecessary
                            to trouble the department now. Suspicious cruisers are hovering about
                            this and the neighboring coasts, and all my present efforts are required
                            for the protection of our exposed commerce.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The accompanying letter from the United
                            States consul at Fayal has just been received, and the facts which he
                            mentions have been confirmed by other information. Letters and telegrams
                            from different sources and <pb facs="0325" n="301" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                            places notify me that several suspicious steamers have recently appeared
                            in the waters between the Azores islands and this coast. Renewed
                            destruction of commerce is to be feared.</p>
                        <p>At this time I have no means at hand to afford protection except such as
                            the good will of this government may provide in a case of extreme
                            emergency. Our special agent in the Algarve district, which, with its
                            indentations and inlets, is well adapted for the concealment of pirates,
                            is vigilant and energetic, and keeps me fully informed upon the matters
                            confided to his agency.</p>
                        <p>It is of material importance that a war steamer of superior speed and
                            sufficient armament should have her headquarters at this port, and that
                            her movements should be governed by the necessities of circumstances as
                            they may arise.</p>
                        <p>The United States steamer St. Louis sailed from here yesterday, but, as
                            her commander did not communicate his purpose to me, I know nothing of
                            his intentions except from common rumor. Had I been notified in proper
                            time I should certainly have advised against the departure of the ship
                            in view of the information now communicated. The public interests must
                            suffer in the future, as they have seriously suffered in the past, so
                            long as the commanders of the ships-of-war which are detailed for duty
                            in these waters have unlimited discretion to regulate their movements
                            without regard to the views of, and without seeking the information that
                            may be possessed by, ministers and others who are charged with grave and
                            important responsibilities, I beg leave to say that, without a hearty
                            co-operation between the civil and naval officers abroad, our exposed
                            commerce cannot be even indifferently protected, and that such a
                            cooperation is not practicable until the orders of naval commanders are
                            so shaped as to require this concert of action.</p>
                        <p>And while upon this subject, I venture to suggest the necessity of
                            explicit instructions being given by the proper department to the effect
                            that the intended movements of our ships-of-war shall not be made known
                            except to such persons as may be entitled to have that knowledge
                            officially. Premature publicity of our plans has operated injuriously in
                            several instances which have fallen under my immediate observation, and
                            I have found myself vexatiously embarrassed and thwarted by the
                            publication of reports by telegraph and through the newspapers of
                            matters which have been regarded as confidential.</p>
                        <p>The insurgents keep an agent at Paris, whose special and exclusive
                            business it is to ascertain the proposed cruises of our ships-of-war and
                            the movements of the commercial marine. That information has been
                            employed frequently to our injury, and I fear it has happened that
                            thoughtless indiscretion upon the part of officers of the United States

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have to inform you that Mr. Hickling,
                            our consular agent at St. Michael, under date of the 12th instant,
                            informed me that on the 29th ultimo he saw a very long three-masted
                            steamer, close in, standing to the eastward, and four days after the
                            same or another of similar appearance passed to the westward. <pb
                                facs="0326" n="302" xml:id="pg_302"/> The apparent object was to see
                            what vessels were at anchor. (I have heard that they showed no flag.)
                            From the same gentleman I received the original letter of Mr. Manuel
                            Barboza da Camara Albuquerque, his deputy at St. Mary’s, in which he
                            announced that, on the night of the 26th to the 27th ultimo, a vessel
                            was seen burning, and in the morning it was supposed that she was about
                            three leagues distant; she continued burning until the following one
                            o’clock a. m., when she disappeared. On the 27th a brig, apparently
                            bound to the westward, approached the vessel on tire, and afterwards
                            stood towards the land, and about an hour after again stood to the
                            westward. The burnt vessel appeared to be a large vessel, high out of
                            water.</p>
                        <p>With great consideration, I have the honor to be your obedient

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The accompanying copies of letters from the
                            United States consul at Fayal and the United States consular agent at
                            St. Michael have just now reached the legation, and I communicate them
                            immediately in the hope that effective measures may be adopted to
                            prevent the illicit traffic to which they refer.</p>
                        <p>It is quite evident, as I have heretofore had occasion frequently to
                            suggest, that the public interests in this quarter cannot be properly
                            protected without the presence of at least two war steamers of
                            sufficient speed and armament.</p>
                        <p>The sloop-of-war St. Louis is of no use whatever in a practical point of
                            view, while her maintenance abroad involves a considerable cost to the
                            government. Besides which, there is a constant danger of her destruction
                            or capture by the superior steam cruisers of the rebels; a fact which
                            would be attended with more injury and humiliation to the national cause
                            than the material value of a hundred such ships.</p>
                        <pb facs="0327" n="303" xml:id="pg_303"/>
                        <p>I am quite aware of the difficulties which perplex and beset the Navy
                            Department in adopting suggestions for an increase of steamships of war
                            on foreign stations; but as the chief embarrassment seems to be rather
                            in regard to the supply of seamen than of steamers, it has occurred to
                            me that the crews of the sailing vessels in these waters might be
                            advantageously transferred to a class of ships better adapted to the
                            requirements of the situation. If my information is correct, the crews
                            of those vessels will willingly renew service on war steamers, though
                            the period of their cruises may have expired.</p>
                        <p>The mid-ocean islands belonging to this government have become too
                            important from their geographical position to be overlooked, and
                            whatever attention may be bestowed in that direction will proportionably
                            reduce the labors and force on the station of the West Indies and those
                            of the blockading squadron.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It is my duty to apprise you that on the
                            3d instant the British (two-masted and two-funnel) schooner Mary
                            Collert, of 248 tons, Captain W. G. Green, came from Liverpool, bound to
                            Nassau for coal, and departed with upwards of 200 tons. She had the
                            appearance of being destined for a confederate cruiser; the master said
                            she can steam eighteen miles per hour.</p>
                        <p>On her arrival I officially applied to the civil governor to have her
                            searched, and, if found with munitions on board, to prohibit the supply.
                            He came personally to tell me that he had no instructions either to
                            search a British vessel, or to prevent the furnishing of what the
                            captain required; notwithstanding which he sent a confidential person
                            privately to see, who reported that he did not observe anything, but
                            thought it probable she had something under the ballast, as she was deep
                            in the water.</p>
                        <p>I must do justice to the civil governor, who, in every case, has
                            manifested the best feelings for the success of the United States in
                            this unprovoked and devastating war.</p>
                        <p>No less than five blockade runners have been supplied here with coal. On
                            the 2d of April a Bremen brig laden with upwards of 300 tons of coals
                            and a large assortment of provisions and spirits from England for the
                            West Indies (strongly suspected for some of the pirates) was condemned

                            a decree (of which I enclose a copy in translation) intended to promote
                            the culture of cotton in the province of Angola, one of its African
                            colonies.</p>
                        <p>The soil and climate of that country are well adapted to the production
                            of the plant, but it may be doubted if the mere inducement of prizes
                            will serve to advance an object which the temptations of high prices and
                            short supplies have failed to attain.</p>
                        <p>With a system of skilled and organized labor the Portuguese possessions
                            in Africa might be made immensely valuable, but this requires more
                            capital, enterprise, and energy than the country can now furnish, and
                            hence there is no serious prospect of immediate competition in the
                            production of cotton from that quarter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I transmit herewith translations of
                            various correspondence between the authorities of the island of Madeira,
                            the commander of the rebel cruiser Florida, and the United States
                            vice-consul, in reference to the supplies which, in my opinion, were
                            improperly furnished to the Florida at Funchal in February last.</p>
                        <p>The existence of this correspondence came to my knowledge quite
                            accidentally, as it was never referred to by either the commander of the
                            United States steamer St. Louis or by the acting consul. Upon being made
                            aware of the fact, I immediately called for the papers, which the
                            vice-consul communicated by the last packet, as they appeared in the
                            official journal of the island, O’Districto do Funchal, of the 5th of
                            March.</p>
                        <p>It appears from this correspondence, that while the governor of the
                            island fully and fairly comprehended his duties at the outset of the
                            affair, he allowed himself subsequently to be persuaded to sanction
                            proceedings for which there was no proper justification, according to
                            his original showing. The Florida entered the bay of Funchal, and had
                            probably made her voyage, without steam. She was not disabled or
                            damaged, and therefore had no claim to ask coal, upon the basis of the
                            privilege of “<hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi>” reserved by the
                            royal proclamation of July 29, 1861. No investigation was made, or
                            sought to be instituted by the authorities of the island, either of
                            their own accord or at the instance of our naval commander or
                            vice-consul, as should have been required, to ascertain whether the
                            claim put forward for supplies was well founded or false. I have reason
                            to suppose that it was a fraudulent pretence, and that the cruiser had a
                            stock of coal in her bunkers at that very time. Moreover, no precautions
                            were taken to prevent a larger supply from being furnished than was
                            prescribed by the governor’s order, and the belief is general now that
                            it was much exceeded.</p>
                        <pb facs="0331" n="307" xml:id="pg_307"/>
                        <p>In view of all the facts of the case, I have not been able to concur with
                            the strong and unnecessary expression of thanks which the commander of
                            the St. Louis “requested” the United States vice-consul to convey to the
                            governor, and by which his conduct throughout is not only commended, but
                            which estops any effective representation from being made here.</p>
                        <p>When his Majesty’s government recently issued unusual and stringent
                            orders to all the authorities of the mid-ocean islands, and sent their
                            best steam vessel-of-war to assist if necessary in enforcing their
                            execution, a great step was taken in the right direction to prevent the
                            depredations to which our commerce has been heretofore exposed. And when
                            the Florida presented herself, soon afterwards, at Madeira, there was an
                            excellent opportunity to settle, once for all, the pretended right of
                            entry and supplies claimed by such piratical cruisers. It should have
                            been decided in our favor, and I regret that the opportunity was not
                            improved by positive and unhesitating action. Much work will now have to
                            be done over again, for if our naval commander publicly and officially
                            thanks a governor for conduct which we are obliged to condemn, he
                            thereby recognizes a precedent that it will be found difficult to combat
                            hereafter. This whole proceeding of offering “thanks” was gratuitous,
                            and hardly in the line of professional duty.</p>
                        <p>The first intelligence in regard to the correspondence now communicated
                            reached me when the St. Louis was here in port. Consequently I addressed
                            a note to her commander, making the necessary inquiries, and asking for
                            an investigation on board the St. Louis, which, for reasons satisfactory
                            to himself, he did not see fit to direct, but which I believed then, and
                            still believe, would have resulted in fuller information on this subject
                            than has yet been obtained. My note and his reply are transmitted
                            without comment, though I am compelled to observe a discrepancy between
                            the language of the vice-consul in his letter to the governor, dated the
                            29th of February, when professedly speaking in the name of the
                            commander, and of that of the commander, speaking for himself, in his
                            answer to me.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            built on the mixed system, and being therefore enabled to navigate by
                            means of her sails, as she no doubt has already done, and as is evident
                            from the fact of her having taken eighteen days in coming from Brest to
                            this port; and it not being consistent with my duty that she should,
                            within the territory confided to me, be permitted to furnish herself
                            with that article in a greater quantity than what is necessary for her
                            to leave this port, attain such a distance off as not to be prejudiced
                            by the ship-of-war of the United States which is likewise now at anchor
                            in this port, and for the purpose of cooking on board, I think that I am
                            only authorized in allowing her to be furnished with twenty tons of
                            coals, which quantity, although not sufficient to put her in a position
                            of causing damage is nevertheless sufficient to avert any danger to
                            which she might, by chance, be exposed on leaving this port.</p>
                        <p>In this sense your excellency will be pleased to communicate with the
                            commander of the aforesaid corsair, and apprise me of the result.</p>

                            sacred, of loyalty towards the flag of a friendly nation, he should be

                            the concession granted him for furnishing himself with provisions and

                            agreed with you, and I having consented thereto, as a sufficient
                            quantity to enable him to leave the port and place himself at such a
                            distance as not to fear his being harmed by the American corvette-of-war
                            now lying in this port, and for purposes of cooking on board; and the
                            said commander has compromised himself to leave this evening, provided
                            that up to the moment of quitting no American war steamer shall heave in
                            sight, in which case he desires and requires to keep himself under the
                            protection of the flag in whose waters he is now riding at anchor. He,
                            however, has asked <pb facs="0334" n="310" xml:id="pg_310"/> me that,

                            means might be employed towards obtaining that the United States war
                            ship now in this port may only leave this port twenty-four hours after
                            his departure; and it being my desire to maintain complete impartiality,
                            thus communicate the same to you, hoping that you will agree with the
                            commander of the American corvette now here, so as to comply with the

                            impossible to comply. I would state that I arrived here last night at 11
                            o’clock, and am out of coal, and require water and bread, and do hereby
                            enter my protest against being forced to leave without the
                            above-mentioned necessaries, and must decline doing so. Should any
                            mishap befall this vessel while out of fuel your government will be
                            responsible for the same. It is actually necessary to have coal, not
                            only for the purpose of propelling the vessel, but also to make fresh
                            water, as this vessel carries a very small quantity of the latter. I
                            only ask for what the English, French, Spanish, and Brazilian
                            governments, and also your own government, have al-already granted to
                            our vessels.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> It has been stated to me that a letter was
                            addressed by yourself and Mr. R. Bayman, United States vice-consul at
                            Madeira, to the governor of that island, complimentary of his conduct
                            towards the rebel cruiser Florida when the commander of that vessel
                            applied for coal and provisions, on or about the 29th of February last.
                            If this statement be correct, it is desirable that a copy of the letter
                            should be furnished to this legation, to enlighten my official action in
                            reference to a question which I consider raised by the proceedings of
                            the governor.</p>
                        <pb facs="0336" n="312" xml:id="pg_312"/>
                        <p>It is also proper for me to request that an inquiry should be made among
                            the officers and others on board the St. Louis, who may be cognizant of
                            any material facts, with a view to ascertain, as nearly as practicable,
                            the actual quantity of coal which was supplied to the Florida. It has
                            been stated that several barges freighted with 10 tons or more of coal
                            each, were seen from the deck of the St. Louis unloading on both sides
                            of the Florida at the same time, two of them being distinctly visible on
                            the exposed side, and the presumption being that the same number were
                            discharging at the other side, as the fact was notorious that four
                            barges were loaded lying in the bay for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>In a letter to Mr. Munro, of the 1st of March, which he communicated to
                            me for information, you state “the governor allowed her (the Florida) to
                            take in 20 tons of coal, and <hi rend="italic">no more.</hi>” In a
                            subsequent letter from Teneriffe a very positive doubt was expressed
                            concerning the quantity of coal really furnished, which must have been
                            justified by subsequent developments.</p>
                        <p>Under all the circumstances of the case it is necessary to institute a
                            thorough inquiry, in order that the public interests may be properly
                            protected here.</p>

                            received. Agreeably to your request, I have to say that the statement
                            made to you, that I addressed a letter to the governor of Madeira
                            “complimentary of his conduct towards the rebel cruiser Florida when the
                            commander of that vessel applied for coal and provisions, on or about
                            the 29th of February last, <hi rend="italic">is false.</hi> I had no <hi
                                rend="italic">written</hi> communication on any subject with the
                            governor of Madeira, nor did I express my approval of his course, in any
                            manner, verbal or otherwise, and I have reason to believe Mr. Bayman did
                            not; but he can best answer. We neither of us <hi rend="italic"
                                >approved</hi> of or <hi rend="italic">assented</hi> to the Florida
                            being supplied with <hi rend="italic">any coals,</hi> or <hi
                                rend="italic">other stores.</hi> That the Florida obtained more than
                            the 20 tons allowed, I have reason to believe, and so communicated to
                            Mr. Bayman from Teneriffe; what that quantity was cannot be known on
                            board the St. Louis, but I presume can be obtained from the records of
                            the custom-house at Madeira or the books of Messrs. Blandy &amp; Co.,
                            who supplied her.</p>
                        <p>As she had 75 tons on board when she arrived, and applied for 110 tons,
                            and three days after leaving Madeira took on board 75 to 80 tons at
                            Teneriffe, I judge she may have obtained from 40 to 50 tons. The agents
                            of the Florida managed the coaling business badly. Two or three cargoes
                            were afloat in the roads, and could have been ordered to sea to meet the
                            Florida at any appointed rendezvous without our being able to prevent
                            it. I enclose two or three notes from Mr. Bayman to me bearing on the
                            subject. The new orders to the governors of the Portuguese Islands not’
                            having been communicated to me officially, and as my knowledge of them
                            is derived from Portuguese officials, I cannot say how far they would
                            authorize a refusal to supply the Florida with coals; but I <hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> His Majesty’s government ordered a census
                            of the kingdom and the colonies to be taken on the 31st of December
                            last, and I now transmit a resume of the results, which, although not
                            published officially, is accepted as being in the main correct.</p>
                        <p>The returns from the Indian and African possessions have not yet been
                            made known. This census is far from being considered perfect, because
                            the mode adopted left it quite discretionary with the population to fill
                            up the printed forms furnished by the government correctly, incorrectly,
                            or not at all. Prejudice was excited among the uneducated classes from a
                            belief that the census was intended as a means of increasing taxation,
                            consequently many made no report, and others made such as best suited
                            their supposed interests.</p>
                        <p>The population of this capital and its environs, in spite of defective
                            returns, sums up much larger than the common estimate allowed it. A very
                            considerable growth has been noticeable in the last few years, which
                            many adverse causes have not been able to retard. The industrious,
                            enterprising, and emigrating Portuguese of the north, who seek and make
                            fortunes in Brazil, generally adopt Lisbon as the abode of their days of
                            ease and plenty.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The regular and final session of the
                            present Cortes draws near to its close after repeated prorogations. Most
                            of the legislation has been of a local character, relating in the main
                            to improvements which have grown out of the progress which Portugal is
                            beginning to feel sensibly and beneficially.</p>
                        <p>The law of all others which excited most attention and controversy,
                            because it affected the largest interests, was that abolishing what is
                            popularly known by the name of the “tobacco monopoly.” For many years
                            past the government <pb facs="0338" n="314" xml:id="pg_314"/> farmed out
                            the large revenue derived from that source by contract for a round sum,
                            giving the contractors the exclusive management of the business, with
                            only a nominal supervision.</p>
                        <p>A formidable organization, which grew to be indifferent to, if not quite
                            independent of, the government, was the result of a pernicious policy
                            which, while it temporarily relieved the financial necessities of the
                            ministry in power for the time being, was eating up the substance and
                            revenue of the country, and enriching selfish contractors at the expense
                            of the State.</p>
                        <p>Public opinion at last demanded a radical change, and after the 1st of
                            January next tobacco will enter the ports like other merchandise,
                            subject to nearly the same scale of duties as has been lately adopted in
                            England.</p>
                        <p>A movement was recently made in the Chamber of Deputies for the abolition
                            of the hereditary feature of the peerage, which lies over for
                            consideration at the next Cortes. The subject will, however, enter to
                            some extent into the approaching elections, and sooner or later the
                            proposition will be adopted, for the march of ideas is altogether in
                            that direction.</p>
                        <p>When the majorat was abolished a year ago the foundation of the old
                            structure was sapped, and peers who originated that reform in their
                            personal interests did not seem to foresee that the house would fall
                            when its corner-stone was torn away by their own hands.</p>
                        <p>The tendency of this people is towards liberal institutions, and even
                            now, notwithstanding the boasted pretensions of others, there is no
                            country in Europe where liberty of speech and freedom of the press are
                            more conspicuous than here. Old traditions and forms still hamper the
                            administration of government and encumber the statute-book with musty
                            relics of the past, but they are doomed to give place to vigorous and
                            healthy reforms more congenial with the spirit of the age, since the axe
                            has been laid at the root of the whole system.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The Cortes were closed yesterday in state
                            by the King, assisted by the Queen and court. I enclose herewith a
                            translation in French of the royal speech delivered on the occasion.</p>
                        <p>A general election for the Chamber of Deputies (the regular term of which
                            is four years) will be held in November next. The different parties are
                            already organising their forces for that contest, but as, with the
                            exception of a fractional minority, they are not divided by any very
                            radical difference of principle, no material change of policy in the
                            course of the government is to be apprehended, whatever the result of
                            the elections may be. Indeed, the dominant political divisions are only
                            separated from each other by phases of liberal and constitutional ideas.
                            Both the great parties claim to be not only equally possessed of these
                            tendencies, but each one claims it more than the other. The interest
                            which favors reaction or return to the order of things which existed
                            before the present constitutional charter is limited in numbers except
                            in the northern part of the kingdom, where it has a certain strength,
                            but not sufficient to give its adversaries any serious anxiety. That

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The news of the naval combat between the
                            United States steamer Kearsarge and the notorious Alabama, and the
                            complete destruction of the latter, created much sensation here
                            yesterday when it became known in the city by a telegram to me, which
                            was immediately communicated to the authorities and to the commercial
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>The Alabama received her first equipment of arms and munitions from
                            English ships, in one of the remote and secluded ports of the Azores
                            islands and her first depredations were committed not very far from the
                            same spot. Attempts were made by her commander subsequently to repeat
                            the outrage which he perpetrated at Angra bay two years ago, but the
                            precautions taken here prevented their success; consequently that
                            cruiser was well known in these parts, and had given our own and the
                            Portuguese officials no small trouble. For this reason a very general
                            interest was excited when the facts became partially understood, and to
                            satisfy it fully I caused all the information in my possession to be
                            given to the public through the principal newspapers.</p>
                        <p>Besides the ordinary effect to be anticipated from such an event, it is
                            quite certain that the rates of insurance on American vessels and
                            cargoes, which had been inflated by various combinations in Europe, will
                            at once collapse and find their proper level.</p>
                        <p>Still it is to be hoped that vigilance on this side of the Atlantic will
                            not be relaxed, because preparations are making at various points to
                            send out more formidable cruisers than the late Alabama; they only wait
                            for a fitting opportunity and a convenient pretext.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The most important and the largest of the
                            internal improvements of this kingdom, the railroad connecting Lisbon
                            directly with Porto, was regularly opened to the public yesterday, and
                            attracted much interest along the whole route. Like all other great
                            works of the kind, this new route is destined to produce valuable
                            results, the more so as the country which it traverses is comparatively
                            rich and a part of it well populated, and because the means of
                            communication heretofore have been quite inadequate to the wants of the
                            community.</p>
                        <pb facs="0340" n="316" xml:id="pg_316"/>
                        <p>The northern portion of the kingdom, which the railroad now taps, is
                            interesting, beautiful, and fertile, with a population of hardy,
                            enterprising men, who regard labor as honorable, and who are the worthy
                            descendants of that stock which gave Portugal her former greatness and
                            glory.</p>
                        <p>Already lateral routes are projected in the northern provinces, shortly
                            to reach the Spanish frontier in that direction, which is now touched by
                            another road already completed beyond Badajoz and soon to connect with
                            Madrid. In two years more, and perhaps before that time, one may be
                            whirled from Lisbon to Paris by railroad without interruption;</p>
                        <p>Portugal has heretofore labored under many disadvantages from her
                            isolated position, but they are fast disappearing under a strong impulse
                            of progress, and foreign capital is beginning to seek the fields of
                            enterprise, which, though long known to exist, have been as it were
                            beyond the grasp of willing and energetic hands. When these resources
                            are properly developed, and industry and commerce shall be wisely
                            regulated, a new era of prosperity may be safely predicted, in which the
                            present generation must largely participate. New connexions with the
                            outer world will bring along with them the ideas, the energy, and the
                            habits that are now in a measure wanting to keep pace with the rapid
                            march of the age, and will ultimately insure a higher destiny for the
                            kingdom than even the most sanguine minds have ventured to
                            anticipate.</p>
                        <p>It is a part of the great law of universal progress which seems to have
                            been beneficently reserved for this era of ours, that all nations and
                            peoples shall, in a greater or less degree, share of its moral and
                            material benefits, and though, as in our own case, the sacrifices
                            demanded by duty appal and awe the stoutest hearts, still they are the
                            purifying influences which Providence has ordered to work out the mighty
                            end in view, and to solve the problem which has hitherto shackled our
                            advance as the representative of free government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to receive your despatch
                            No. 140, accompanied by a correspondence between the Secretary of State
                            and the chairman of the Committee on Commerce of the Senate, in relation
                            to a project for an inter-continental telegraph to connect the eastern
                            and western hemispheres by way of Behring’s Strait.</p>
                        <p>The views of the department on this important subject are stated with so
                            much clearness, and ability, and force, and the valuable information
                            embodied in the general résumé of the practicability and utility of the
                            enterprise is so instructive, that I venture to believe and hope that
                            Congress will accept and adopt them as the basis of prompt and efficient
                            legislation,</p>
                        <p>Whatever opinions I may have heretofore entertained as to the necessity
                            of telegraphic communication between the Old and New World, considering
                            the proposition mainly with regard to commercial and material interests,
                            I am satisfied, from some observation and practical experience, that in
                            a political or public aspect it is of still greater consequence for the
                            present and for the future.</p>
                        <p>All the first intelligence of affairs in the United States brought across
                            the ocean by the steamers plying between European and American ports is
                            now distributed over Europe, either upon the authority of imperfect,
                            partial, distorted <pb facs="0341" n="317" xml:id="pg_317"/> or
                            fictitious reports furnished by employés of the principal British
                            newspapers temporarily or permanently residing in our large cities, or
                            through telegraphic agencies on this side, which are equally unreliable,
                            prejudiced, and illiberal. The consequence is that a false coloring is
                            given to almost every fact, and the public mind is constantly misled by
                            malicious or ignorant misrepresentation. Bo systematic has this course
                            of conduct become, that those who are better informed as to the real
                            state of affairs at home and the probable turn of events generally read
                            these telegraphic reports in a directly opposite sense to that given and
                            intended, and it may be asserted that, in nearly nine cases out of ten,
                            the contrary conclusion proves to be the correct one when the full
                            accounts are received—the very accounts, too, upon which these false
                            telegraphic reports were professedly predicated.</p>
                        <p>It will thus be seen at a. glance how much the national cause has
                            suffered abroad from the want of a direct and immediate means of
                            telegraphic communication, such as would enable us to be heard fairly,
                            would allow the actual facts to speak for themselves, and at the same
                            time would enable the public authorities to confer freely with their
                            agents and to correct these errors and misapprehensions in our foreign
                            intercourse, which have grown to be serious and embarrassing in many
                            essential respects.</p>
                        <p>Looking at such a telegraphic connexion with application to the actual
                            position of the country, its importance cannot be well overstated, and
                            there is hardly any undertaking which for substantial merit deserves to
                            commend itself more to public favor, or which would be so serviceable to
                            the nation in its exterior relations.</p>

                            registers of American ships during their stay in port, much to the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A letter from the secretary of our
                            legation at London, written in the absence of Mr. Adams, informed me
                            several days ago that the rebel cruiser Georgia had left the port of
                            Liverpool for Lisbon, having been ostensibly converted into a
                            merchantman, and chartered by this government for a voyage to their
                            African possessions.</p>
                        <p>My attention had been previously called to this matter by newspaper
                            reports and by a telegram from Mr. Dudley, of the 12th instant, giving
                            information that the Georgia had sailed the previous day. The
                            ship-of-war Niagara was then in the Tagus, and the telegram was
                            immediately communicated to Commodore Craven, her commander, who started
                            from here on Sunday, the 14th instant, the third day after his
                            arrival.</p>
                        <p>Although eleven days have elapsed since the Georgia left Liverpool she
                            has not appeared here yet, and is not now expected. The contract for her
                            voyage to the coast of Africa to carry the mails seems to have been made
                            through the Portuguese consul at Liverpool, in ignorance of the
                            liability of the Georgia to be taken as a good prize on the high seas,
                            and in culpable disregard of her antecedents. He may have been imposed
                            upon by the pretended transfer of the* cruiser and the fact that she was
                            dismantled afterwards, which, together with the charter in question,
                            were doubtless devices employed by the parties interested to put to sea
                            under shelter of the British flag.</p>
                        <p>The government cancelled the contract for the Georgia when informed of
                            the facts, and much feeling was manifested upon change and in the
                            newspapers that any terms whatever should have been entertained or made
                            with a vessel of such notorious character. This expression was the more
                            emphatic because the commercial community are seriously embarrassed in
                            their operations for the want of a direct means of communication with
                            Africa, as they depended exclusively upon the charter of a special
                            steamer after the government had dissolved a former contract.</p>
                        <p>I fear the Georgia has gone to some appointed rendezvous for the purpose
                            of being armed and equipped to depredate upon our commerce. Every
                            vigilance will be exercised here, but at this moment there is no
                            ship-of-war within call, and I am quite ignorant of the movements of
                            those now on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Our consul at Gibraltar communicated to me
                            the following information, in a letter dated the 26th of September,
                            which reached here last evening:</p>
                        <p>“I have just received the following from our consul at Malta, under date
                            of the 21st instant:</p>
                        <p>“‘An armed bark-rigged confederate steamer was seen off Sicily yesterday
                            morning. She had three masts.’”</p>
                        <p>As none of our ships-of-war are now in these waters I could do nothing
                            more than send a telegram (herewith enclosed) to Mr. Sanford, at
                            Brussels, in the hope of reaching the Niagara or Sacramento, both of
                            which were recently reported by the newspapers to be at Antwerp and
                            Flushing. I am wholly ignorant of the whereabouts of the Iroquois.</p>
                        <p>It is much to be regretted that no system has been devised by which the
                            diplomatic representatives of the government should be informed of the
                            movements of the national ships which have been sent abroad to protect
                            our exposed interests. Nothing would be more simple or easy of execution
                            if the subject could receive the serious attention which it deserves,
                            for the proper application of existing means is all that is needed.
                            Exigencies like the present one frequently occur, and cannot be
                            efficiently met, because no concerted plan for interchanging information
                            between our civil and military agents has been adopted.</p>
                        <p>There are now three fine ships-of-war in Europe, and I find myself quite
                            unable to communicate directly with either of them, from ignorance of
                            their movements, and that, too, when their service is immediately
                            demanded. So it was when the Florida lately appeared at the Azores, and
                            could have been intercepted by prompt measures, which it was found

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The telegram communicated herewith was
                            received from the United States consul at Liverpool yesterday. Another,
                            containing substantially the same facts, reached this legation on the
                            11th instant.</p>
                        <p>This information has been sent to our consul at Madeira; but there is no
                            immediate opportunity of forwarding it to the Azores. It is quite
                            impossible to communicate directly with our naval officers now in
                            Europe, as the whereabouts of the different ships is as unknown to me as
                            to Mr. Dudley at Liverpool. This simple fact illustrates the absolute
                            necessity and importance of at once perfecting some mode of organization
                            by which all the agents of the government abroad may act in concert and
                            with efficiency. Otherwise commerce will be exposed to constant danger
                            from piratical cruisers, and the naval force which is or may be
                            maintained in Europe will continue to be impaired in usefulness.</p>
                        <p>I venture to hope that this subject may receive the attention of the
                            proper department, and that a simple plan may be put in operation,
                            whereby it will be always practicable to invoke the aid of a ship-of-war
                            in emergencies like the present.</p>
                        <p>Since the withdrawal of the official agent in the Algarve there is reason
                            to apprehend that the secluded resorts of that part of the coast, which
                            are infested by a bad population, may be at any time employed to our
                            serious injury.</p>

                            letter of the 14th instant, also one from the consul with the same
                            information.</p>
                        <p>The screw steamer Laurel arrived here on the 13th instant, for Liverpool,
                            reporting cargo merchandise for Bermuda and Matamoras; crew, forty men,
                            and twenty-nine passengers, said to be Poles going to enlist in the
                            rebel army; none of them came on shore. The Laurel took in 140 tons of
                            coal, and was to have left yesterday evening, but a screw that had to be
                            made was not finished as promised till this morning, when the vessel
                            left quite early, but previous to her departure a steamer was signalled
                            and reported as the port’s African packet, but when it came off the port
                            she hoisted English colors and signals, indicating, according to the
                            code, Laurel, and, as the other vessel went out about the same time, it
                            was generally thought it was to give armament to the other to start a
                            fresh pirate. I did not see the vessel, but those who did describe her
                            as a fine-looking three-masted screw, about the size of the Kearsarge,
                            but not strong enough to carry heavy guns.</p>
                        <p>I give you this statement and leave you to communicate with the United
                            States government as you may think proper.</p>
                        <p>I believe the pirate Laurel meant to leave on the evening of the 17th
                            instant, yesterday, and, consequently, the other steamer was another
                            Laurel, and, as frequently occurs here, hoisted her real name in order
                            that she might be reported by Lloyd’s agent at this place. Had the
                            meeting been previously arranged, it seems to me that some means of
                            communication would have been adopted unintellegible to the student of
                            Marryat.</p>

                            <p>The papers received by us from this city are of the 13th October. The
                                most important news they contain relates to a serious question
                                between the governments of Brazil and the United States, which has
                                been provoked and caused by the commander of the federal steamer
                                Wachusett, which has dared in the Brazilian waters to attack the
                                confederate steamer Florida, to kill some of her men on board, and
                                to take her away from the port in opposition to international
                                rights, and in spite even of the fire of the corvette Dona Januario,
                                which tried to put a stop to the outrage committed by the commander
                                of the Wachusett.</p>
                            <p>The following is referred to in the Jornal de Bahia:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Treason, insult, and cowardice</hi>—We have now to
                                register another outrage to our sovereignty, another insult made to
                                our means of defence.</p>
                            <p>The public is already aware of the occurrence which took place in our
                                port between the North American steamer Wachusett and the
                                confederate Florida, but as it might be appreciated unjustly, and to
                                the detriment of our national honor, we shall minutely relate all
                                the circumstances as they took place. The steamer Florida, belonging
                                to the southern Confederate States, had entered our port on the 5th
                                from Santa Cruz, Teneriffe, in sixty-one days, to repair her
                                machinery and take in provisions and water, as the crew had been
                                under one ration of salt beef and drinking filtered sea-water. The
                                American consul claimed from the president of the province that she
                                should not be admitted in the port, and that she should be brought
                                to account for not having respected the Brazilian waters, she having
                                set fire to an American vessel near the island of Fernando Noronha.
                                The president declared that he had allowed her two days which she
                                required to repair her machinery.</p>
                            <p>The North American steamer Wachusett was lying in port. As soon as
                                the Florida came in there had been an evident movement on board of
                                her.</p>
                            <p>Fearing some rencontre, as a<hi rend="italic"> cartel</hi> had been
                                issued, the provincial president obtained from the American consul
                                his word of honor that the country would be respected, and that no
                                occurrence would take place inside the port or the national
                                waters.</p>
                            <p>The Florida for greater security placed herself under the batteries
                                of the flag-ship.</p>
                            <p>On the 6th, the latter’s crew being much in need of repose, one half
                                thereof had liberty given them and went on shore, returning on board
                                in the evening, many of them quite drunk, and the commander of the
                                Florida, considering himself safe in a neutral port, allowed eighty
                                of his crew and several officers to sleep on shore on the night of
                                the 6th instant. At 3.10 a. m. the officer on watch, Hunter, jr.,
                                was surprised to hear that on board the Wachusett they were slipping
                                their chains, and he immediately called his crew to quarters—a very
                                difficult operation.</p>
                            <p>Almost at the same instant he was being boarded by some boats full of
                                men, who received from the Florida a discharge of musketry, but the
                                Wachusett <pb facs="0347" n="323" xml:id="pg_323"/> came to the
                                relief of her boats without its having been perceived, having
                                smothered his fires and availed herself of the very dark night. She
                                had left her anchorage and swiftly proceeded to the Florida, passing
                                under the stern of the Dona Januario, the latter ordering her
                                immediately to cast anchor, to which the commander of the Wachusett
                                paid no attention, but rapidly threw herself on the Florida’s stem
                                which was lying to the north with her head to the flood. Hardly was
                                she on the Florida but she fired her bow-gun on her with shot and
                                canister, and sending on board the Florida (which at once lost a
                                mast) many of her men, and receiving a slight volley from the
                                Florida. It is reported that there were many deaths on both sides in
                                the fight which then took place, chiefly hand to hand, both sides
                                being armed with swords and revolvers, but it lasted a short time,
                                as the Florida’s crew only consisted then of about fifty men. Among
                                the dead the officer on watch is reported as having received a ball
                                in his chest and having been subsequently hung; that the officer,
                                Stone, having killed more than six men, and finding himself
                                surrounded and overpowered, had fired into his own mouth, thus
                                expiring immediately, and that another officer who had jumped on
                                board the Wachusett had then stabbed and killed six men, but had
                                himself subsequently been killed.</p>
                            <p>Of fifteen sailors who threw themselves overboard four escaped,
                                having been picked up by merchant vessels lying near. The remaining
                                eleven were shot by the enemy, who fired nine shots on one man
                                alone. This rapid fight was followed by a short silence, which gave
                                place to prolonged <hi rend="italic">hurrahs</hi> from on board the
                                Wachusett.</p>
                            <p>The chief of division, Gewazio Manceba, sent a boat under Lieutenant
                                Varella to the Wachusett, to order the commander immediately to cast
                                anchor, as he would sink her if the manifestations were continued.
                                The commander replied, under his word of honor, that he would do
                                nothing further, and that he would immediately return to his
                                moorings. This reply was given to the officer, the commander not
                                permitting him to come on board the steamer. But the Wachusett had
                                rapidly passed a tow-rope to the Florida, and, pretending to resume
                                her moorings, proceeding, steering southwest, passed at a distance
                                of a cable’s length from the Dona Januario’s bow; the latter then
                                fired eight shots at the steamer, which made no reply, but, on the
                                contrary, tried hard to get beyond reach of the corvette’s range.
                                The latter’s shots almost all struck the steamer, as the uns were
                                pointed by her best artillerymen.</p>
                            <p>In this state of things, the crews of all the ships of war being at
                                quarters, the chief of the division ordered the steamer Paraense,
                                who had her fires lighted from the commencement of the fight, to
                                take the corvette in tow as soon as she had sufficient steam, and
                                the corvette aiding with her sails, so as to be in a position to
                                retake the prize. The division got under way in the following order:
                                steamer Paraense, corvette Dona Januario, and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >hiate</hi> Rio de Contras. Judging by the speed at which the
                                North American steamer was towing the Florida, it was expected that
                                the corvette would gain on her. When outside the lighthouse the
                                chief of division called all the officers to his cabin, and invoking
                                their attention to the insult which had been received, declared that
                                he was going to sink the steamer to retake the prize and bring her
                                back to port if possible; that, burning with indignation, he was
                                prepared to sacrifice to demonstrate that the honor of a nation was
                                not to be thus wounded with impunity. These expressions were
                                received with enthusiasm by all the officers, who called for the
                                fight with immense ardor. Chase was immediately given to the
                                steamers, which were ahead at a distance of five miles, and doing
                                their best to run away.</p>
                            <p>Up to 7 o’clock in the morning the Paraense, with the corvette in
                                tow, was gaining on the American ships in a decided manner; the
                                fight appeared now certain; but the wind died away gradually. The
                                Florida, which up to this moment was being towed, began to steam and
                                had her sails out, thus, along with the Wachusett, gaining ground
                                and ignominiously running away from our ship. <pb facs="0348"
                                    n="324" xml:id="pg_324"/> The corvette continued a vigorous
                                chase, as well as the other vessels, while the Americans pursued
                                their flight. After losing sight of land, and the fugitives being
                                likewise out of sight, the pursuit was given up at 11.45 a, m.</p>
                            <p>We are told that the enthusiasm, valor, and courage displayed by the
                                chief, his officers, commander of the corvette, and the respective
                                crews, were indescribable.</p>
                            <p>It being impossible to do more, the chief of division with his staff
                                came on board the steamer Paraense and entered the port at 3.30 p.
                                m., leaving outside the corvette and <hi rend="italic">hiate</hi>
                                Rio de Contras.</p>
                            <p>The Florida was repairing one of her engines, some of the tubes
                                whereof are now in the navy yard.</p>
                            <p>It is to be deplored that none of the forts should have fired at
                                least one shot, especially the Gambon fort, as the fugitives passed
                                within one-third shot distance from her. The sea fort, when the
                                boarding took place, merely fired three blank shots as a signal.
                                Although badly armed, these forts might have caused some damage to
                                the fugitives, and perhaps have forced them, by some unexpected
                                effect of the shots, to stay their course; nevertheless everything
                                and everybody appeared to be asleep when the honor of the country
                                was in danger.</p>
                            <p>It cannot, however, be denied that the North Americans have committed
                                in our port, within our waters, an act of barbarism, or rather of
                                real piracy, which is tantamount to an infamous treachery towards
                                their adversaries, an insult to us, and a shameful cowardice on the
                                part of a nation which prides itself on its naval strength.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Reprisals.</hi>—Yesterday when the news was known
                                in the city of the insult offered to us by the American steamer
                                Wachusett, which captured at night within our port the confederate
                                steamer Florida, a mob of people went to the office of the American
                                consul at the Conceicai and pelted with stones the coat of arms
                                which hangs over the door, took it down, and rolled it along the
                                streets. In front of the custom-house some of the Florida’s crew
                                wanted to secure the coat of arms, which, however, was not given up
                                to them.</p>
                            <p>The police immediately sent a force to the house where the consulate
                                is located, and kept guard on the house till night-fall.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The United States steamer Sacramento
                            arrived at this port on Saturday evening, and I had a conference this
                            morning with her commander in regard to his movements, with reference to
                            the rebel cruisers now afloat and depredating upon our commerce. The
                            orders of that officer confine his cruises to the coast of Europe, where
                            the services of his ship are not as much required as among the mid-ocean
                            islands, to be guided by information received here. He is anxious to do
                            all that a sense of duty demands, and in an emergency would be governed
                            by imperative circumstances for justification in departing from the
                            strict letter of orders, which are the law to every proper and obedient
                            officer.</p>
                        <pb facs="0349" n="325" xml:id="pg_325"/>
                        <p>There are frequent occasions when it might be proper for the minister at
                            Lisbon to advise a cruise in the direction suggested or elsewhere,
                            without having sufficient data to justify him in assuming a
                            responsibility which might seem to conflict with the standing
                            instructions of the Navy Department to its officer. And herein lies the
                            difficulty and embarrassment of restricted orders for this distant
                            service, which cannot foresee the contingencies that have so often
                            occurred to the public disadvantage, and that have very recently been
                            repeated in the equipping and arming of a new rebel cruiser called the
                            Shenandoah at the Desertas of Madeira, under the supposed command of R.
                            Semmes, formerly of the Alabama.</p>
                        <p>It was well known in Liverpool that a steamer called the Sea King was to
                            be converted into a hostile cruiser, and that another steamer called the
                            Laurel was to proceed to an appointed rendezvous, with the armament to
                            be transferred at a fitting opportunity. That information was in my
                            possession long before either vessel left England, but every effort on
                            my part to communicate with one of our vessels-of-war failed, mainly
                            from the want of knowledge of their whereabouts, and the criminal
                            enterprise succeeded, with abundant means at our disposal to prevent
                            it.</p>
                        <p>In saying that, I refer to the fact that the Niagara has been practically
                            tied up for several months at Flushing, Antwerp, and the British
                            colonies, and, as is understood, waiting for the orders which are to
                            regulate her future movements. There is no present necessity or even
                            good use for a vessel-of-war in that part of Europe, while there have
                            been constant and urgent reasons for one or two war steamers plying
                            between this port and the Azores, Madeira, Teneriffe, and Cape
                            Verde.</p>
                        <p>I have on several occasions ventured to suggest a plan of organization
                            for the naval force now in Europe, predicated upon my personal
                            experience and observation. The pressure of more imposing duties has not
                            hitherto allowed it to receive attention; but it is quite obvious that
                            unless some system be adopted by which greater efficiency will be given
                            to this force our commerce will be exposed to renewed outrages, and the
                            government to the reproach of having abundant resources for its
                            protection, without seeming to have the disposition or the wisdom to
                            apply them.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                            for the liberal and friendly answer of the Italian government to my
                            suggestion concerning a purchase of the ships-of-war recently built for
                            its use at New York.</p>
                        <p>The attention of statesmen, measurably withdrawn from America, seems to
                            be now fastening itself entirely upon European questions. Information
                            concerning these questions has a certain value for us, although we have
                            no direct interest in or responsibility concerning them. The position
                            you occupy doubtless enables you to study the events occurring on the
                            shores of the Mediterranean from the Alps to the Adriatic, while your
                            long experience will assist you to form prudent judgments concerning
                            their tendency and probable results.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons your correspondence is regarded, at the present moment,
                            with special interest.</p>

                            character, and it seems probable that all parties will prefer to
                            postpone operations during the present year.</p>
                        <p>Our own campaigin is opening with an army virtually renewed. The election
                            indicates increased soundness and steadiness of public opinion, and
                            devotion to the Union.</p>

                            accompanied by printed copies of two treaties lately concluded between
                            the kingdom of Italy and the French empire, and of a ministerial
                            circular extending the benefits of those treaties to the states referred
                            to in the circular, has been received and duly considered. The President
                            is pleased to learn that your efforts to secure for the <pb facs="0352"
                                n="328" xml:id="pg_328"/> United States the privileges accorded by
                            the treaties in question to France and to the states mentioned in the
                            circular have been successful.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the request made by you at the instance of the secretary
                            general of the ministry of foreign affairs, the President instructs me
                            to transmit the accompanying full power, authorizing you to negotiate
                            with his Majesty’s government a new treaty of commerce to take the place
                            of the existing treaties between the United States and the kingdoms of
                            Sardinia and the two Sicilies. You will accordingly, upon the receipt of
                            this instruction, make known to his Majesty’s government your readiness
                            and authority to enter upon the negotiations with any person similarly
                            empowered on its part, and you will proceed to prepare a projet of a
                            convention which shall embody the principal features of the two treaties
                            last referred to, with such modifications and additions as your
                            experience and known familiarity with the respective interests of the
                            two countries may suggest. When such a projet shall have been drawn up,
                            and agreed to by his Majesty’s plenipotentiary, you will forward a copy
                            of it hither for the consideration and further instruction of the
                            department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have read with much interest your
                            confidential despatch of the 25th October, which is devoted exclusively
                            to Italian politics.</p>
                        <p>Italy being a hereditary monarchy in the house of Savoy, has, in that
                            circumstance, a guarantee of considerable value against the
                            demoralization which might be expected to follow a change of capital
                            from its western interior position to an eastern one, or near the
                            Mediterranean. Time will probably materially modify the political
                            sentiments of the Italian people, and thus impair the guarantee I have
                            mentioned. As a distinct proposition I should think any removal of the
                            capital unwise, and a removal to Rome most unwise of all. But Italian
                            statesmen seem to think otherwise, and we may wisely, perhaps, leave the
                            question to their judgment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I received last evening a note from the
                            ministry of foreign affairs, a translation of which is hereunto
                            annexed.</p>
                        <p>As the ministry has been several times changed since August, 1861, it is,
                            perhaps, not strange that my note to Baron Ricasoli, dated on the 26th
                            of that month, proposing the negotiation of a convention between the
                            United States and, the kingdom of Italy for the recognition of the
                            principles of maritime law declared by the congress of Paris, should not
                            be known to the members of the present cabinet, but it is remarkable
                            that the government of France, after having <pb facs="0353" n="329"
                                xml:id="pg_329"/> communicated to that of Italy our proposal of
                            adhesion in terms implying that the adhesion had been accepted, should
                            not have informed the Italian government that the proposed convention
                            was not consummated.</p>
                        <p>The minister of foreign affairs receiving only on Saturdays, I had an
                            interview with the secretary general this morning, referred him to my
                            note of August 26, 1861, which I found was familiar to officers who have
                            been longer in the department than Mr. Cerruti, explained to him the
                            reasons why our adhesion must be given, the form of a convention, and
                            stated the causes of the failure of the regulations at London and Paris
                            in 1861.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cerruti informed me that the proper action to be pursued by his
                            government towards vessels under the confederate flag had been discussed
                            by the diplomatic council, upon the supposition that the adhesion of the
                            United States to the principles adopted by the congress of Paris had
                            been formally given and accepted, and he added that the failure of the
                            negotiations for that purpose gave the question a new aspect in some
                            respects, and would, perhaps, somewhat modify the conclusions at which
                            the council had arrived.</p>
                        <p>The point raised by my note of July 11, 1861, was then discussed, and I.
                            learned that the government had consulted some of the ablest Italian
                            jurists on the subject. The question of the probability of nationalizing
                            and investing with an official character as a ship-of-war a
                            foreign-built vessel never brought within the territorial jurisdiction
                            of the states by which it was commissioned was, as Mr. Cerruti informed
                            me, considered a matter of much delicacy and difficulty; but though I do
                            not expect that this government will fully concede the grounds I
                            assumed, I was assured that such order would be given to the local
                            authorities as would substantially answer the purpose I had in view, in
                            case a confederate cruiser should enter an Italian port. I ought to add
                            that Mr. Cerruti expressed the continued spmpathy of his government for
                            our cause, and I have no doubt of the entire sincerity of these
                            assurances.</p>
                        <p>The conduct of this government is the more entitled to a generous
                            appreciation by us because the cutting off the supply of cotton is a
                            severe injury to Italian industry, especially at a moment when both vine
                            culture and silk husbandry are suffering such ruinous consequences from
                            the maladies of the grape and the silk worm; and apprehensions are
                            entertained of serious disturbances from the expected suspension of
                            large cotton factories near Genoa, which would throw many hundreds of
                            laborers out of employment.</p>

                                the government of the Emperor of the French informed us that the
                                United States of America had declared their intention of accepting
                                the principles of maritime law proclaimed by the congress of Paris,
                                and that the imperial government was ready to certify (<hi

                                the act of adhesion of the United States to the declaration of the
                                congress of Paris has been officially received, and at what precise

                            espouse the confederate cause. The hope of obtaining the cession of
                            Venice from Austria, as one of the conditions of the establishment of an
                            Austrian prince on the throne of Mexico, is not altogether without

                        <p>In conversation with the minister of foreign affairs yesterday morning,
                            the minister alluded to a recent proposal in behalf of the United States
                            government for the purchase of the iron-clad frigates now building at
                            New York for the King of Italy, and said that his Majesty’s government
                            would very gladly oblige that of the United States in the way proposed;
                            but that the possible and even probable necessities of Italy were such,
                            that in the present aspect of affairs the ministry would not think
                            itself, or be thought by the nation, justifiable in depriving it of any
                            element of military strength which it now possessed or could command. He
                            begged me, however, to be assured that his Majesty’s government
                            continued to feel the strongest interest in the prosperity of the United
                            States and the success of the federal authorities in putting down the
                            present unnatural warfare, and added that it would always be happy to
                            give us any proof of its friendship consistent with the usages of modern
                            international law and civilization.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to say that the recent expositions of the condition of affairs
                            in America, from the State Department at Washington, have produced a
                            very favorable impression in most parts of the continent, especially in
                            Italy; and <pb facs="0355" n="331" xml:id="pg_331"/> though the conduct
                            of the war by the Federal government is still criticised as wanting in
                            energy and severity towards the rebel States, yet its management of our
                            relations with Europe receives unqualified praise from all those
                            European statesmen who are liberal enough to find anything to applaud in
                            the acts of a republican government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> According to the custom of this court, the
                            members of the diplomatic corps at Turin were separately received, in
                            private audience, by the King of Italy on the last day of the year 1863.
                            In my interview with his Majesty he inquired respecting the recent
                            intelligence from America, but made no further observations beyond the
                            expression of a hope that the present struggle, which was attended with
                            consequences so injurious to the industry of Europe, might soon be
                            brought to a close.</p>
                        <p>The two leading administration papers at Turin, the Opinione and the
                            Stampa, which were formerly favorable to the interest of the Union,
                            having lately deserted them and virtually espoused the confederate
                            cause, and the Opinione being generally regarded as a semi-official
                            organ of the government, I thought it proper to draw the attention of
                            the ministry of foreign affairs to some offensive articles on this
                            subject in the columns of the latter journal, and I expressed the hope
                            that they were not to be regarded as authorized by the administration,
                            or as expositions of the sentiments and opinions now entertained by it.
                            I was assured, in reply, that the government was in no way responsible
                            for the articles in question, and did not share the views of the
                            writers.</p>
                        <p>I forward, through Mr. Miller, the Opinione of September 28 and of
                            December 30, containing leading articles which will give you an idea of
                            the spirit with which that able and influential, as well as otherwise
                            calm, liberal, and canded journal, is animated towards us.</p>
                        <p>Although, as I have remarked in former despatches, the Federal cause is
                            not, upon the whole, increasing the number of its. friends on the
                            continent, we have still the good wishes of nearly all the friends of
                            progress in Italy, and even so unimportant a circumstance as the recent
                            publication of the correspondence between Jefferson Davis and the Pope
                            has produced an impression quite favorable to us.</p>
                        <p>The letters are thought by many to show that between the great enemy of
                            African liberty in America and the great enemy of all liberty in Europe
                            a sympathy exists which is not shared by the people of the north, nor
                            the government which represents it. The letters have been published in
                            all the liberal papers in Italy, except those hostile to the Union
                            cause, which, so far as I can learn, have not noticed the correspondence
                            in their columns.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I enclose herewith a copy of No. 89 of the
                            Official Gazette of the kingdom of Italy, for the present year, dated
                            April 13, containing a royal decree on the subject of the entrance of
                            foreign ships-of-war into Italian ports, and I forward in another
                            envelope No. 90 of the Gazette, containing the report on which the
                            decree in question is founded.</p>
                        <p>I have this morning called the attention of the minister of foreign
                            affairs to the provisions of this decree, and inquired whether it was
                            intended to apply them rigorously to our only vessel-of-war at present
                            in the Mediterranean. The minister replied that such was not the purpose
                            of the government, and that the decree would not, in the actual state of
                            things, be held to apply to our small naval force in that sea, or to
                            make any change in the extent of the privileges hitherto allowed to us
                            for the convenience of our armed vessels in Italian ports.</p>
                        <p>The report, as you will observe, paragraph sixth, seems to imply that the
                            decree would not be considered as extending to us under present
                            circumstances, and the minister observed that the eighth article of the
                            decree might be considered as embracing our case, we having no
                            ships-of-war in the Mediterranean sent out for belligerent purposes.</p>
                        <p>For the present, then, we are not likely to be embarrassed by the
                            provisions of the new decree; but if our force should be augmented, or
                            if confederate cruisers should make their appearance within the straits
                            of Gibraltar, a less liberal rule of action toward us might be
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>Having in view the royal patent of 24th November, 1827, which settled
                                the regulations of the ports; the penal law affecting the merchant
                                service, dated 13th January, 1827; the royal decree of 22d December,
                                1861, which extends to the new provinces of the kingdom the laws and
                                regulations for the merchant service in force in the old provinces;
                                considering the state of existing relations existing between Italy
                                and other maritime states which are engaged in open hostilities;
                                considering the prerogative reserved by international maritime law
                                in respect of some particular points along the coasts of a maritime
                                state, in view of upholding and guaranteeing the neutrality of the
                                kingdom toward belligerent powers, and to enforce under any
                                circumstances those rights which may possibly arise out of or flow
                                from such a condition, as well as for the object of preserving its
                                freedom of action intact; on the suggestion of our minister of
                                marine, in concert with that of the minister for foreign affairs, we
                                have decreed and do decree:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 1. It shall not be allowed that any
                                vessel-of-war, armed and on a cruise, of any belligerent state,
                                enter and sojourn with prize in the ports or roadsteads of the
                                kingdom except in cases of stress.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 2. In case of entry under stress,
                                ships-of-war armed for cruising, referred to in the preceding, and
                                under the conditions therein pointed out, must remove <pb

                                kingdom as soon as the cause which compelled them to seek refuge has
                                passed away, with reserve of the provisions of article 11.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 3. No sale, exchange, barter or gift
                                of objects proceeding from prize shall be made under any pretext in

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 4. Every Italian subject is forbidden
                                from taking a commission from a belligerent party to arm vessels for

                                the prescriptions of the precedent articles 4 and 5, or commit any
                                act in behalf of a belligerent power contrary to the duty of
                                neutrality maintained by the government of Italy toward the said
                                parties, shall not have a right to protection against any act or

                                same, without prejudice to the punishment which by effect of this
                                decree is threatened against them in provisions of article 80 of the
                                penal code for the merchant marine, dated 13th January, 1827.</p>

                                coast of the kingdom, or the adjacent waters, although she present

                                of at least 24 hours between the sailing of a belligerent party, and
                                the following departure of the other party. This interval may be
                                extended according to circumstances by the maritime authorities of
                                the place.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> 12. In the ports considered as marine

                                only be prolonged in case of stress or damage, after formal
                                permission from the royal government, for which the local authority
                                of the port must apply through the minister of marine.</p>

                                prescribed in this present decree, which will take effect from the
                                day of its publication in various parts of the kingdom.</p>

                            post printed copies of two treaties lately concluded between the kingdom

                            the benefits of these treaties to the states referred to in the circular
                            in question.</p>

                            France by these treaties, and the custom-house authorities at Genoa and
                            elsewhere of course do not think themselves authorized to admit
                            merchandise imported from America upon payment of the reduced duties
                            stipulated by the new treaty with France. This fact became known to me
                            only in the course of the last week, and I at once called the attention
                            of the ministry of foreign affairs to the subject.</p>
                        <p>Some difficulties were raised by the ministry of Vienna, but after
                            several discussions with the secretary general of the ministry of
                            foreign affairs, the minister not having received the members of the
                            diplomatic corps for the last two weeks, I have been this morning
                            informed by the secretary general that it was decided to put our
                            commerce on the same footing with that of other nations which have
                            concluded treaties of commerce with Italy, and that orders to that
                            effect would be immediately given to the custom-house officers in the
                            ports of this kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The secretary states that his government desires to negotiate a new
                            treaty of commerce with the United States, and requests me to ask full
                            powers and instructions for that purpose. Our treaty with Sardinia
                            differs in many particulars from the last treaty concluded between the
                            United States and the Two Sicilies. I am told that the Italian
                            government regards all treaties between foreign states and the kingdom
                            of the Two Sicilies as abrogated, at least for most purposes, by the
                            annexation of that kingdom to Sardinia, and considers the treaties
                            between these states and Sardinia as now extending to the whole
                            kingdom.</p>
                        <p>It is easy, however, to see that upon the revival of our commerce with
                            Sicilian ports it may become an important question whether we are not
                            entitled to the rights and subject to the responsibilities established
                            by the treaty with the kingdom of the Sicilies so far as regards
                            commercial operations in these ports.</p>
                        <p>The anticipation of such difficulties is an argument of some weight for
                            the negotiation of a new treaty, and the ministry of foreign affairs
                            desires that certain privileges—the surrender of deserters from the
                            Italian commercial marine in our ports, for instance, and reciprocally
                            of deserters from our merchant ships in Italian ports—which have been
                            conceded to other nations, be mutually secured to each other by the
                            United States and Italy.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>You will have learned that a treaty for the
                            withdrawal of the French garrison from Rome has just been concluded
                            between the Italian government and the Emperor of France. Rumors of
                            pending negotiations to that effect had, indeed, been some time in
                            circulation, but they were generally regarded as but the hundredth
                            repetition of reports which never had a solid foundation, and the
                            Italian people were quite taken by surprise by the official confirmation
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>The conditions of the treaty are not yet made public, but it is known
                            that among them is a stipulation on the part of Italy to transfer the
                            seat of government from this city to Florence. It is also believed that
                            there is a provision for the assumption of a large part of the public
                            debt of the pontifical government by this kingdom, and it is much feared
                            that the Italian government has, by express promise, or by secret or
                            implied pledge, entered into engagements which are tantamount to a
                            renunciation of the claims of Italy upon Rome as her national
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>I regret to say that I do not think it improbable that this apprehension
                            is substantially well founded. The known opinions and sympathies of some
                            Italian statesmen who are believed to have been active in effecting the
                            conclusion of the treaty, and many other circumstances, give countenance
                            to this view of the subject, and I have no doubt that this Italian
                            ministry understands the Emperor Napoleon as considering the removal of
                            the seat of government to Florence to be a virtual abandonment of the
                            purpose of establishing it at Rome, though it is not likely that such an
                            engagement appears on the face of the treaty, or has been in any way<hi
                                rend="italic"> formally</hi> entered into.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * </p>
                        <p>It is not to be denied that there is much popular dissatisfaction with
                            the policy of this administration in many parts of Italy, and that
                            political agitators, Romish, Bourbon, and Mazzinian, are constantly
                            putting the question, What has Italy gained by her pretended unity? But,
                            after all, there is no question that the belief of a community of
                            interests, the consciousness of a national life, and the conviction that
                            immense advantages to the whole Italian people have already resulted
                            from the gathering of the different provinces under one political
                            organization, are strong and rapidly growing sentiments throughout the
                            peninsula. This, I have reason to believe, is scarcely less true of
                            Naples than of the rest of the kingdom. Distracted as the rural
                            districts of southern Italy are by brigandage and priestly and political
                            intrigues, the recent progress of the city of Naples and of all the most
                            populous parts of the adjacent provinces in material prosperity, in
                            intelligence, in public order, and respect for law has been extremely
                            rapid, and that population seems now hardly less attached to the new
                            government than any others of its subjects. Ten years ago Naples and its
                            dependent territory were socially, morally, and politically more
                            degraded than Spain, or even Greece but they have now left; these states
                            far behind them in the march of substantial improvement. The dynastic
                            views of the French Emperor will find no support in Naples. The Murat
                            faction, always insignificant, has ceased to exist, and the partisans of
                            Francis II keep their numbers good only by the recruits who are sent
                            them by Pius IX and their own fugitive King.</p>
                        <p>The question of the removal of the seat of government is naturally a very
                            exciting one for Turin, and the transfer will meet with a determined
                            and, perhaps, very formidable opposition from the people and politicians
                            of Piedmont. Turin has been a royal capital for generations. It can
                            hardly be said to have <pb facs="0360" n="336" xml:id="pg_336"/> had any
                            other existence or source of life than as a governmental residence, and
                            all its local institutions, all its social habits, all its industrial
                            life, have been modelled accordingly. Its growth, though slow, had been
                            steady, but it received a sudden stimulus in 1848, then an abrupt check
                            from the expectations of the removal of the court to Rome in 1860, and
                            then a new and strong impulse from the rapid increase of the number of
                            its inhabitants, and the apparent defeat or indefinite postponement of
                            the realization of those expectations on the retirement of the Ricasoli
                            ministry in 1862.</p>
                        <p>Since that period a very large number of new houses have been built, or
                            rather commenced, to accommodate the excessively crowded population of
                            the city. The mode of construction prescribed by the customs of the
                            country and by municipal regulations is enormously costly, and a long
                            time elapses between the laying of the foundations and the actual
                            occupancy of the huge piles which are erected as dwellings. Hence a
                            large capital—often borrowed for speculation in building—has been
                            invested in houses, few of which are yet in a state to receive tenants.
                            The proposed change of capital threatens these operations with at least
                            a long suspension, and the enterprising constructors and their creditors
                            with ruin, and at the same time menaces a town which is the winter
                            residence of almost every influential family in Piedmont with the utter
                            prostration of all its material interests.</p>
                        <p>There has, however, thus far, been no ebullition of popular feeling nor
                            any violent expression of public dissatisfaction. All are anxiously
                            waiting the disclosure of the terms of the treaty and the action of
                            Parliament upon them, and in the mean time preparing for a strenuous
                            opposition to the proposed change, which will find many powerful
                            adversaries in other provinces as well as in this.</p>
                        <p>Parliament is summoned to meet on the 4th of October, and it is supposed
                            it will be very soon dissolved, and the election of a new chamber
                            ordered to assemble soon at Florence. It is also thought probable that
                            the King, the court, and the ministers will spend the winter at that
                            city, but that the secretaries general of the departments and the
                            inferior <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the public offices, as well
                            as the archives of the kingdom, will remain at Turin for several months
                            longer, and that the ordinary routine of public business will go on here
                            until perhaps another summer.</p>
                        <p>If this plan of a <hi rend="italic">divided</hi> capital is adopted the
                            diplomatic corps may be embarrassed in the choice of a residence. It
                            being usually impossible to hire houses here for short terms, most of
                            the foreign ministers, I unhappily among the rest, have taken apartments
                            and offices on leases which have still at least a year to run, and we
                            shall very probably be obliged to take apartments and keep offices open
                            both at Florence and at Turin. The question of removal of the capital
                            and of my own principal residence will necessarily be decided before I
                            can hear from the department. I shall endeavor to act solely with
                            reference to the public good; but as I shall in any case be obliged to
                            submit to a heavy pecuniary sacrifice, I shall hope for the indulgence
                            of the President in case I am thought to have made an erroneous
                            decision.</p>

                            suggests. In the mean time, for reasons which need not be suggested, I
                            limit myself to the statement of a very few facts. The number of lives
                            lost in the collisions between the citizens, the police, and the
                            soldiery, is believed to be larger than has been publicly admitted. Some
                            well-informed persons estimate it at not less than a hundred, but I
                            think that this is probably an exaggeration.</p>
                        <p>There is good reason to believe that the police is in a great measure
                            responsible for the first resort to actual violence; and the government
                            has tacitly admitted this by dissolving the branch of that service which
                            is thought especially culpable.</p>
                        <p>As to the conduct of the ministry of the interior, which is fiercely
                            assailed, it is difficult to get at the truth; but I find it impossible
                            to resist the conclusion that a less precipitous and more conciliatory
                            course on its part would have saved the effusion of much of the innocent
                            blood which has been shed—I say <hi rend="italic">innocent,</hi> because
                            it is positively asserted, and is, so far as I know, an undisputed fact,
                            that not one of the citizens killed or wounded was found to have been
                            armed.</p>
                        <p>It is also stated, and I have not seen the statement contradicted, that
                            the death of most, if not all, of the soldiers who were killed is to be
                            ascribed to the folly of their commanders, who posted them on three
                            sides of a public square of no great extent, so that when the order was
                            given to fire on the crowd in the centre the opposite lines of troops
                            were exposed, at very short range, to each other’s balls.</p>
                        <p>General La Marmora has not yet succeeded in forming a ministry. Baron
                            Ricasoli has been in consultation with La Marmora, and it is hoped that
                            he will accept a place in the cabinet. No man deserves or enjoys the
                            confidence of the Italian people in a higher degree than Ricasoli, and I
                            know of nothing which would go further to calm the present excitement
                            than his acceptance of the position of minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Opinione, of this city, which was understood to be the special organ
                            of Mr. Monghetti, and which, I suppose, expresses the views of General
                            La Marmora, admits this morning, for the first time, that the treaty
                            which had been declared by the government journals to be already
                            complete and binding must be submitted to Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The stipulations of the convention have not yet been made public, and of
                            course it is impossible to pronounce at present how far the sanction of
                            the legislature is required for its validity.</p>
                        <p>The fifth section of the constitution of 1848 is as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The executive power belongs to the King alone. He is the supreme head of
                            the state; commands all the forces by land and by sea; concludes
                            treaties of peace, alliance, commerce, and others, giving notice thereof
                            to the Chambers as soon as the interest and the safety of the state
                            permit, and adding the necessary communications. Treaties involving a
                            burden to the finances or changes of the territory of the state shall
                            not have effect until the assent of the Chambers is obtained.”</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">written</hi> treaty may be unobjectionable, but it
                            is hardly to be supposed that Parliament will sustain the government in
                            carrying out any convention without satisfactory assurances as to the
                            nature and extent of the secret articles and moral guarantees which may
                            accompany it.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding the severe bombardment of the Danish left flank near
                            Dübbel no material damage has been sustained. Count Hamilton (late
                            Swedish minister) returned from Als yesterday, and thinks the Danes will
                            be able to hold their position for some weeks. An attack on the whole
                            line is expected. The Danes are said to have had a decided success in a
                            naval engagement off Swinemünde, (the mouth of the Oder.) A Prussian
                            steamship, two corvettes, and six gunboats, under command of the
                            Prussian admiral, undertook to compel a Danish frigate to raise the
                            blockade, and were so severely handled that they sought shelter under
                            the guns of Swinemünde. Should this war continue and become more
                            general, I submit whether our commerce in the German ocean and in the
                            Baltic would not require the presence of an American man-of-war.</p>

                            repulsed in their attacks on Dübbel and Frederica. Before the former
                            place the Prussian army must have lost heavily. His Majesty returned
                            yesterday from the army, pronouncing everything as satisfactory as
                            possible. The Danish government, after declining the first invitation to
                            the English conference, have finally accepted it on the basis of the
                            treaty of 1851-‘52, <hi rend="italic">or on some other condition equally

                            of the 19th instant, on the part of his excellency, from Mr. Vedel, in
                            relation to the Bremen and Hamburg steamers, I can assure his Majesty’s
                            government that its willingness to receive a suggestion (not a demand)
                            from the United States will give great satisfaction to that government.
                            The Bremen steamers carrying the United States mails are the Bremen, the
                            New York, the Hansa, and the America. <pb facs="0364" n="340"

                        <p>The last despatch from my government approves of my course here in
                            relation to his Majesty’s government, and the assurances I have given
                            that the United States will be strictly neutral, and not permit the
                            arming, fitting out, or equipping of any armed vessel against Denmark or
                            the commerce of this kingdom.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatches Nos. 87, of the 6th of
                            April, 88, of the 19th of April, and 89, of the 7th of May, (the latter
                            enclosing the President’s letter of condolence,) have been duly
                            received. His Majesty is at present in the country, but I shall avail
                            myself of the earliest opportunity to present the same. You will have
                            learned, perhaps, before this reaches you, of the extension of the
                            armistice to the 25th instant. The Danish minister has not much hope of
                            peace, though his government is willing to accept a division of
                            Schleswig on the line of Heü and Frederickstadt, a surrender of the
                            whole country occupied by Germans. I am more hopeful of peace, as I can
                            hardly conceive that the four powers not interested would have advised
                            this line unless they were prepared to back it up. To leave the matter
                            to a vote, under the auspices of Prussian and Austrian bayonets, would
                            be to forestall it with a vengeance. I see no reason to change the
                            opinion hitherto expressed, that the object of Prussia was the
                            dismemberment of Denmark. The same fate, I fear, awaits every small
                            power in Europe at all liberal. I shall send herewith a map, (if I can
                            procure one,) with the proposed line of division, and beyond which the
                            Danes will not go.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> On the 21st instant I had an audience of
                            his Majesty, to deliver the President’s letter of condolence on the
                            occasion of the death of the Landgravine princess royal of Denmark,
                            Louise of Hesse. He received me with his <pb facs="0365" n="341"
                                xml:id="pg_341"/> usual cordiality, thanked the President for his
                            letter, and wished me to convey to him his compliments. He is, of
                            course, much tried. At the time of this interview the Russian government
                            was pressing the union of Schleswig and Holstein, and a mere personal
                            sovereignty. It was rejected. Its acceptance by the King would have led
                            to the resignation of the ministry. Denmark may be crushed and divided
                            up, but she will not be a voluntary party to her own annihilation, and
                            the proposition of Russia discloses the fact that she is acting with
                            Prussia. In my late interview with the King, he said that Denmark could
                            not accept the proposition to divide Schleswig on the line of Flensborg
                            and Tondern and which Prussia has proposed. Of course it is expected
                            that hostilities will be resumed after the 26th instant, to-morrow, and
                            to present appearances England is becoming more warlike. In a
                            conversation with my colleague, the British minister, Sir A. Paget, I
                            incidentally referred to our line of action in this war, as indicated by
                            the President, in sanctioning the assurances I gave the minister Mourad,
                            and communicated in my despatch No. 149, of the 7th of March last. He
                            immediately caught at this, and requested leave to communicate it to his
                            government. You will readily see the bearing of this, to what it may
                            help lead, and the division it may create. Repugnant and unwilling as
                            England is to engage in war, we must not make the mistake of supposing
                            she will not, under certain circumstances, go to war.</p>

                            copy of a letter to Consul Boernstein, and which explains itself. I
                            await your opinion in relation to it. We have the news of the
                            destruction of the Alabama by the Kearsarge, on the 19th instant, off
                            Cherbourg. In accordance with the position assumed by Great Britain (and
                            virtually conceded by the then Secretary) in the case of the Caroline,
                            the Alabama should have been destroyed long since in a British port. The
                            English are great casuists; and, as I see in their interpretation of the
                            word “channel,” in the Oregon treaty, would give it a different meaning
                            from what the same word has in connexion with “the Irish,” “the
                            English,” and any number of other channels.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have received your note of the 10th
                            instant, enclosing the letter of C. Gottfried Kohler, of the firm of T.
                            M. de Müller, at Altenburg, Saxony, requesting information in relation
                            to the Sophie, a Bremen ship, “bound from Matamoras to Bremen, with one
                            hundred and fifty bales of cotton on board, sent by a brother of the
                            said Kohler, an alleged citizen of the United States, residing at
                            Houston, Texas, and which ship was said to have been captured by a
                            Danish cruiser on the 19th April last.”</p>
                        <p>In reply, I learn that said ship has been condemned, and all the cargo,
                            excepting two hundred bales of cotton. You do not say in your note which
                            of the brothers owned the cotton. If it belonged to the German American,
                            the invoice, I suppose, would show that fact; and if he has not
                            renounced or forfeited his American citizenship, I should not apprehend
                            any difficulty in the case. He, of course, must show his citizenship,
                            and show his right to the property so captured, to avail himself of the
                            provisions of international law in such cases; and our courts have held
                            that proof of ownership should accompany the goods seized. At all
                            events, there must be unquestionable evidence to whom the property
                            seized belonged.</p>

                            contract with the owner of the line of steamers which plies between
                            Bremen and New York for the carriage of the mails between these points.
                            The service is of great importance to this government itself, and to the
                            large interest concerned in trade and intercourse between the United
                            States and Germany. During our late war with Mexico the English line of
                            mail steamers to Vera Cruz was allowed to continue its trips unmolested.
                            Though England was then a neutral, and, therefore, in a very <pb

                            her belligerent interests to put a stop to the trips of the steamers

                            attention of the department by a despatch from the consul at Hamburg,
                            accompanied by a copy of a letter to him from the directors of the
                            Hamburg Steamship Company.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the controversy between Denmark and Germany, it is
                            needless to say that we are neutrals, and that we shall take no part
                            therein. Our relations to one country are not less friendly than those
                            which exist towards the other, and for the sake of both, and of the
                            general interests of society, we regret the war which has broken out
                            between them.</p>
                        <p>The Bremen and Hamburg steamers are very useful to the United States as
                            carriers of mails and merchandise, more so now than heretofore, owing to
                            the embarrassments of our commerce. It would be agreeable to us if their
                            trips should not be interrupted, and you are instructed to make this
                            known to the Danish government. In doing so, however, you will be
                            careful to let it be understood that we make no demand in the premises,
                            and that all you have been instructed to communicate on the subject is
                            intended to be merely suggestive of what would be considered by the
                            United States as a gratifying evidence of the friendship and good will
                            of Denmark.</p>

                            addressed to this department by Dr. Durbin, corresponding secretary of
                            the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal church, dated at New
                            York, on the 30th ultimo, in which it is requested that you be
                            instructed to ask the government of Denmark to concede to that church in
                            the Danish kingdom, and particularly in Copenhagen, the same liberty
                            that is granted there to the English, French, German, Catholic, and
                            other foreign churches. This request appears to me to be
                            unobjectionable, and you are, therefore, directed to comply with it by
                            addressing a note to the Danish minister for foreign affairs, asking
                            that privileges similar to those which are accorded to all other
                            Christian denominations in Denmark may be granted to the Methodist

                            was duly received. As you are aware that this government still maintains
                            diplomatic relations with the republican government of Mexico, I regret
                            to learn from your despatch that you had thought it not improper to
                            exchange visits with the envoy of the so-called Imperial government of
                            that country to the courts of St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen,
                            on the occasion of his recent visit to the latter place. The error on
                            your part is quite excusable, because you were without instructions upon
                            the subject. You will be expected, however, hereafter to bear in mind
                            that you can know no government of any state but the one which is
                            recognized by this department, and that only agents of governments which
                            are acknowledged here can be treated by you as representatives of

                            however, that the voyage of the vessel referred to must have been in
                            violation of our own laws, and the owner of the cotton, presupposing him
                            to be an insurgent, is clearly entitled to no reclamation.</p>

                            regret, that Baron Wetterstedt has been ordered to Mexico on a mission
                            of some character before coming to this country as the diplomatic agent
                            of Sweden. It is proper that you should without delay inform the
                            minister of foreign affairs that the proceeding referred to is, for
                            obvious reasons, far from satisfactory to this government, and that if
                            it should not prevent the Baron’s official reception here, it would
                            certainly make him less welcome.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have perused your circular, No. 39, with
                            great interest and satisfaction; the résumé is calm, able, and
                            dispassionate, convincing to all impartial minds, even to those laboring
                            under erroneous information and prejudice; it must and will have great
                            effect, especially when results are more favorable than when
                            written—August 12, 1863.</p>
                        <p>The public mind of this kingdom is now occupied by the apprehended action
                            of the German Bund in the “Danish question,” a wearisome German
                            crotchet, most difficult to understand or appreciate. Denmark, Sweden,
                            and Norway, under the genuine term of Scandinavia, are not numerically
                            strong when compared with Germany, (about eight millions,) but powerful
                            in the vigor and independence of their inhabitants, and very important
                            by geographical position. The German Bund, it is thought, has gone so
                            far in the Danish question that it cannot, without loss of dignity,
                            retreat, and it is, therefore, greatly feared that a “corps of
                            execution” will be sent into Holstein. It is said that 5,000 men will
                            enter the duchy, and that a federal army of 50,000 men will be prepared
                            to enforce obedience to the behests of the Bund. The Germans are mad on
                            this question, and I firmly believe that nothing would please them
                            better than to go to war “with the oppressors of their brethren in
                            Holstein and Schleswig.” The inhabitants of the fatherland are unable to
                            emancipate themselves, but, Quixotte-like, are desirous to give liberty
                            to others. It is more likely their great zeal for the union of Schleswig
                            and Holstein is the dream of a German fleet, and intense passionate
                            desire to get Keil as a German seaport. Denmark stated to the Bund that
                            she will not withdraw the proclamation of the 30th of March; that she is
                            ready to take into consideration the proposals of the German
                            confederation and carry out those resolutions of the federal diet, not
                            incompatible with the sovereign and legislative power of the King; that,
                            having recognized the political autonomy of the duchies, no more can be
                            done by her. The Danish government also stated that it will consider the
                            sending of federal troops into Holstein an act of hostility, and will
                            take the necessary measures for maintaining the integrity of the kingdom
                            of Denmark. It is said that a draft of a treaty of alliance between
                            Denmark and Sweden has already been drawn up, and that Sweden will place
                            a “corps d’armée” at her disposal; independent of a treaty, this nation
                            would not willingly remain passive spectators; in fact, the government
                            could not sustain itself if it assumed a neutral position. Denmark and
                            Sweden could blockade the German coast and ports of the Baltic,
                            including the “Hanse” towns, and suffer but little in return. My own
                            conclusions are, there is not much danger of such a rupture or
                            difference as to lead to war. Germany is powerful for defence, not for
                            aggression; often threatening, seldom strikes; quibbling always, never
                            acting; correct in theory, false in practice; suggesting the attitude of
                            the sculptured warrior, the blow ever impending, but never falls. Nor do
                            I think England, France, or Russia will suffer this question to result
                            in war, if it can be prevented by diplomacy or otherwise, as they very
                            well know a very little spark will sometimes kindle a great European
                            war.</p>
                        <p>A treaty of amity, comity, and navigation has been made between the
                            kingdoms of Sweden and Norway and the republic of Liberia, in London, by
                            Count Wachtmeister, (Swedish minister to England,) on the part of his
                            government, and Gerard Ralston, on the part of Liberia.</p>
                        <p>The police arrangements made some time ago I will keep in force until the
                            close of the navigation of the Baltic, on or about the 5th of
                            December.</p>

                            Count Manderström, Swedish minister of foreign affairs, to the Swedish
                            ambassadors in London and Paris. The note of Count Manderström fully
                            confirms the intimations given in the King of Denmark’s address to the
                            Chambers.</p>
                        <p>Count Manderström asserts that every <hi rend="italic">pretext</hi> for
                            “federal execution” has been removed by the repeated declarations of
                            Denmark; that the invasion of any territory of Denmark must be
                            considered a hostile attack, which it is the duty of Denmark to oppose
                            by all means at her disposal. Count Manderström says, “Things have
                            arrived at a point at which <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> intervention
                            in the <hi rend="italic">internal affairs</hi> of Denmark becomes really
                            unendurable; the most extreme measures would be preferable to an
                            unjustifiable submission, in which the Danish people will not
                            acquiesce.”</p>
                        <p>This is the present state of affairs: that both Sweden and Denmark now
                            submit to the cabinets of London and Paris, claiming protection against
                            German aggression. War can only be arrested by a word from Prussia,
                            which will probably be the agent of the violence with which Denmark is
                            threatened. But as Prussia has the stomach to eat with zest indefinite
                            amount of diet, she will eat this (before war) as a change of diet for
                            health by advice.</p>

                            <p>The following note has been addressed by Baron Manderström. Swedish
                                minister for foreign affairs, to Baron N. Adelsvärd, Swedish
                                ambassador in Paris:</p>
                            <p>“The important political affairs which, during the last few weeks,
                                have agitated the European cabinets, and engaged their whole
                                attention, have caused facts which would not have failed to excite
                                general attention at a less animated time to pass by almost
                                unobserved.</p>
                            <p>“Among these is one to which we think it our duty to direct the
                                serious consideration of the government of his Majesty the Emperor
                                of the French. It concerns, as may be easily understood, the new
                                phase upon which the Danish question has entered through the
                                resolutions taken by the German federal diet. In consequence of
                                these resolutions Denmark will soon receive a demand—if, indeed, it
                                has not already been made—to withdraw within six weeks’ time the
                                patent of the 30th of March, 1863, under threat of a federal
                                execution in Holstein. We do not yet know the resolution which
                                Denmark will take, but it appears to us that it cannot be doubted.
                                Things have arrived at a point at which foreign intervention in the
                                internal affairs of Denmark becomes really unendurable. The most
                                extreme measures would be preferable to an unjustifiable submission,
                                in which the Danish people will not acquiesce. We may, therefore,
                                suppose that the Danish government will reply, that by the patent of
                                the 30th of March, 1863, Denmark had conceded to Holstein all the
                                rights which the federal diet has demanded for that duchy. Denmark,
                                therefore, fulfilled all her duties as a federal member, since by
                                this patent the mutual relations of the different parts of the
                                monarchy are established in such a manner that the legislation <pb
                                    facs="0375" n="351" xml:id="pg_351"/> and taxation in the other
                                parts of the kingdom become independent of that which will be
                                adopted in Holstein and Lauenberg.</p>
                            <p>“The Danish government will ever be ready to carry into execution the
                                resolution passed in Frankfort relative to the internal
                                administration of these duchies. Every cause as well as every
                                pretext for a federal execution being, however, removed by this
                                declaration, as also by the patent of the 30th of March, the Danish
                                government can only regard such proceeding as having an object
                                entirely apart from the competency of the German diet, and must
                                therefore consider it a hostile attack, which it is her duty to
                                oppose by all the means at her disposal.</p>
                            <p>“In case this should be the reply of the Danish government, which, as
                                I have already said, appears most probable, it will not be denied
                                that it is based upon facts.</p>
                            <p>“The demand of the federal diet for a common constitution for the
                                whole monarchy is untenable, because it is the German diet itself,
                                and the Holstein estates, which have rendered such an arrangement
                                impossible. As regards the duchy of Schleswig, it is a fact that the
                                Danish government, after Schleswig’s administrative separation from
                                Holstein, decided to extend the liberties of this province, and that
                                it never took any steps to incorporate it with the kingdom. In any
                                case, this is a question with reference to which the federal diet is
                                entirely incompetent, as regards the claims which, in common with
                                Austria and Prussia, it considers itself entitled to make relative
                                to the negotiations of 1851 and 1852.</p>
                            <p>“In the meanwhile the diet’s ill-concealed desire to mix itself up in
                                this question causes the danger of the situation, which we can only
                                regard as highly critical, and approaching a crisis which would
                                unavoidably endanger the peace of the north, and very likely of the
                                whole of Europe.</p>
                            <p>“The government of the King has long avoided a return to this
                                question, but, believing itself to be unable any longer to remain
                                silent, it considers it to be its duty to submit the state of
                                affairs for examination to the cabinets of Paris and London.</p>
                            <p>“It appears to us that it can scarcely be the wish of those cabinets,
                                particularly in the present state of the negotiations relative to
                                Poland, that a war should break out in the north during the present
                                year. Such an event, however, might happen within a few weeks,
                                should Denmark not meet with such support from those cabinets as
                                would protect her against the aggressive measures of Germany. We
                                will not take upon ourselves to propose the means by which such a
                                contingency might be averted. We believe, howeve, that we have a
                                right to express our opinion upon this question. We have this right,
                                first, on account of the sincere feelings of friendship which bind
                                us to the two governments to whom we address ourselves; and,
                                secondly, because of the serious consequences which might result
                                from a contest from which the force of circumstances could alone
                                prevent us from holding aloof, since our dearest interests would not
                                allow us calmly to see our neighbors oppressed under pretexts which,
                                at a later period, might endanger our own independence.</p>

                            despatch of the 5th of last month No. 34.</p>
                        <p>I take the liberty to enclose an abridgment of the great Swedish case
                            (cut from the London Times) relating to “the duties of neutral nations.”
                            In 1825, the <pb facs="0376" n="352" xml:id="pg_352"/> Swedish
                            government was occupied in the construction of its navy, and had sold
                            several vessels of war considered unfit for service. Among others in the
                            year 1825 three vessels, one ship-of-the-line and two frigates, were
                            offered for sale at. Stockholm; these vessels were purchased by a
                            British mercantile firm in open market. The Spanish minister, M.
                            Alvarado, (instructed by his government,) having cause to believe or
                            discovering that the vessels were intended to augment the naval forces
                            of the revolted Spanish American colonies, protested and remonstrated
                            against their being permitted to depart from Sweden, “since these ships
                            (no doubt without the cognizance of the Swedish government) are destined
                            to re-enforce the rebel armaments of Mexico.” He also writes that he is
                            well aware that the British purchasers are far from admitting such a
                            destination, but, on the contrary, have omitted no means to dissemble
                            it, and thereby to deceive the good faith of the cabinet of Stockholm;
                            also, that the sale of such public vessels not being an act of customary
                            trade on the part of a government of a state, Spain protests against it,
                            as an act inconsistent with the neutrality of the Swedish crown.</p>
                        <p>M. de Curry, in commenting on the above transaction in his treatise
                            entitled “Phases et Causes Célèbres du Droit Maritime des Nationes,”
                            observes that the sale of these ships was originally intended as a
                            simple operation of commerce upon the part of the Swedish government,
                            and as such was perfectly legitimate on its part; but as soon as it was
                            brought clearly to its knowledge that such of the vessels as had been
                            permitted to sail were destined to augment the maritime forces of the
                            insurgent colonists, the Swedish government felt it to be inconsistent
                            with the neutrality of the Swedish crown that it should lend itself to a
                            transaction whereby the state would be rendered subservient to the uses
                            of war of one of the belligerent parties, to the manifest prejudice of
                            the other, and as its good faith had been surprised, cancelled the sale
                            of such of the vessels as were still in Swedish waters.</p>
                        <p>The purchasers received $9,000 from the Swedish government for giving up
                            their bargain, and so the affair peaceably concluded.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>At a moment when public attention is
                                much directed to the question of the sale or equipment of vessels of
                                war on account of belligerent states within the precincts of neutral
                                governments, a short account of a diplomatic correspondence, forming
                                an authentic precedent in some degree bearing upon this subject,
                                will probably be acceptable to your readers. I am not aware that the
                                Swedish case to which I am about to refer has been noticed in the
                                recent discussions of this head of international law. The documents
                                relating to this matter will be found in a recent volume of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Causes Célèbres du Droit des Gens,</hi> published
                                by Baron C. Martens, (vol. v, Cause iv, p. 229.) For the benefit of
                                those of your readers who may not have access to the work, I will
                                give a short but sufficient abstract of the facts—the
                                correspondence. I may mention that I have omitted a good deal of the
                                merely political part of the discussion, which smacks not a little
                                of the doctrines of the Holy Alliance. Apart from this, however, the
                                legal bearings of the case are well deserving of study and
                                consideration.</p>
                            <pb facs="0377" n="353" xml:id="pg_353"/>
                            <p>For several years the Swedish government had been occupied in the
                                reconstruction of its navy, and had put up for sale several vessels
                                of war, which were considered unfit for service. This traffic had
                                taken place publicly, without objection in any quarter. In the year
                                1825 three vessels, one ship-of-the-line and two frigates, were
                                offered for sale to the Spanish minister at Stockholm. On his
                                declining to purchase them they were put up for sale in the open
                                market, and were purchased in due form by the firm of Michaelson
                                &amp; Benedicks, who re-sold them to the house of Barclay, Haming,
                                &amp; Richardson, of London. Shortly after the conclusion of this
                                contract, and before the delivery and departure of the vessels, it
                                became generally rumored that they had been, in fact, purchased on
                                account of the revolted states of South America, with whom Spain was
                                then at war. This transaction led to a correspondence of
                                considerable interest and importance between M. d’Alvarado, the
                                representative of the court of Spain at Stockholm, and Count
                                Wetterstedt, the Swedish minister for foreign affairs. The following
                                extracts will give your readers an idea of the leading features of
                                the discussion.</p>
                            <p>In a note dated July 1, 1825, M. Alvarado, after reciting the sale of
                                the vessels, remonstrates against their being permitted to depart
                                from Sweden, “since these ships (no doubt without the cognizance of
                                the Swedish government) are destined to re-enforce the rebel
                                armaments of Mexico. The undersigned is well aware that the
                                purchasers are far from admitting such a destination, but, on the
                                contrary, have omitted no means proper to dissemble it, and thereby
                                to deceive the good faith of the cabinet of Stockholm; that they
                                have alleged that the vessels are twenty or thirty years old: that
                                their second tier of guns has been withdrawn; and, lastly, they have
                                announced that their object is to traffic with India,”</p>
                            <p>The Spanish minister then proceeds to point out the obvious futility
                                of these pretences. He argues, first, “that the purchase of
                                ships-of-the-line by a private individual is an unheard of thing.”
                                Next, “that the vessels in question are wholly dissimilar to those
                                employed in the service of the East India Company.” Thirdly, he
                                points out the absurdity of the supposition that the English
                                merchant should have purchased the vessel on his own account. It is
                                a government, he argues, not an individual who is the natural
                                purchaser of ships of war. <hi rend="italic">It is notorious that
                                    the South American republics are greatly in want of ships. And,
                                    further, the English firm in question is known to be largely
                                    engaged in the rebel loan, and consequently deeply interested in
                                    the rebel cause.</hi> “These observations,” proceeds the
                                note,</p>
                            <p>“Prove sufficiently that the English firm can have no other object in
                                acquiring these vessels than to hand them over to the Mexicans; it
                                has the greatest interest in so doing, and will inevitably do so.
                                After such decisive considerations, can it be necessary to recall
                                the public notoriety of the destination of these ships accredited at
                                Stockholm, Carlscrona, Gothenburg, and London, by public rumor, by
                                commercial correspondents, and even by persons on board the vessels
                                themselves, some of whom aver that they are bound to an unknown
                                destination, while others more frankly speak of their voyage to
                                America? To demand a greater certainty than that which is afforded
                                by such grave presumptions and such vehement grounds of suspicion
                                would be to require the public and legal confession of the
                                purchasers, which it is too much their interest to withhold, or at
                                all events that material but too tardy demonstration which will one
                                day be acquired when the vessels covered by a Mexican flag shall
                                have attacked the Spaniards in the Atlantic.”</p>
                            <p>The Spanish minister proceeds to urge upon the consideration of the
                                Swedish court the following consideration:</p>
                            <p>“What would the King of Sweden think, supposing Norway to be in
                                revolt, if friendly and allied powers were to furnish arms,
                                munitions, and even a fleet to the rebels through the medium of
                                speculators and under the pretence of ignorance of the results?
                                Would the cabinet of Stockholm, when it was apprised of these
                                preparations, wait till the iron and cannon furnished to its enemies
                                had mowed down its soldiers, and the vessels so made over to the
                                rebels had annihilated its commerce and desolated its shores, before
                                it reclaimed against and if possible prevented such
                                transactions?”</p>
                            <pb facs="0378" n="354" xml:id="pg_354"/>
                            <p>The Spanish note concludes by demanding that the contract of sale to
                                the English firm should be rescinded, or at least that the vessels
                                should be detained until further instructions.</p>
                            <p>Count Wetterstedt, the Swedish minister, replied in a note of the
                                date of July 7. 1825. He first of all argues the good faith of his
                                own government— which, indeed, was not disputed—and shows the
                                complete <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of the sale. He then
                                proceeds to the following effect:</p>
                            <p>“A grave accusation is founded upon this sale. The vessels, it is
                                alleged, are destined to re-enforce the maritime armaments of the
                                rebels in Spanish America. Where assertions of this peremptory
                                character are advanced, and a demand for the rescinding of the
                                contract is based upon them, one has a right to expect material
                                proofs of a positive and indisputable character. These the
                                undersigned cannot discover in the reasonings of the Spanish
                                minister founded on the nature of the vessels and the relations of
                                the purchasers with the South American republics. When the public
                                notoriety of the destination of the vessels is relied upon, and
                                letters from persons on board are referred to, it would have been
                                highly desirable that the Spanish minister should have given the
                                details of the information he appears to possess and the
                                correspondence which is alleged to exist, in order that the matter
                                might be kept out of the vicious and deceitful circle of rumor and
                                hearsay. If the Spanish minister can, or thinks he can, demonstrate
                                that the purchasers of these vessels have formed the intention of
                                putting them to a use which may be injurious to Spain, his court
                                should address itself to the British government, which alone can
                                exercise the proper control over its own subjects. But to demand the
                                arrest of a sale upon simple presumption, and under the apprehension
                                of future dangers which might result from it, would be to annihilate
                                the activity and development of all commercial transactions.”</p>
                            <p>Referring to the supposition made by the Spanish minister of a
                                rebellion in Sweden, Count Wetterstedt adds:</p>
                            <p>“In such a case the Swedish government would not seek to render
                                foreign governments responsible for any succors which their
                                subjects, without their knowledge, and contrary to their orders,
                                might render to the insurgents.”</p>
                            <p>The Swedish note ends by declining to comply with the demand of the
                                Spanish minister.</p>
                            <p>On July 15, 1825, M. Alvarado writes a further note, in which he
                                calls attention to suspicious circumstances with reference to the
                                enlistment of crews of the Swedish navy, and then, recurring to the
                                former argument, protests against “the doctrine of irresponsibility
                                which the cabinet of Stockholm professes with regard to these
                                vessels.” He treats <hi rend="italic">with disdain the suggestion of
                                    a recourse to the British government,</hi> and adds that “this
                                will be no <hi rend="italic">justification for Sweden,</hi> since
                                she is the <hi rend="italic">only government in the world which by
                                    selling vessels of this description without precautions to
                                    foreign speculators is the primary cause of the mischiefs which
                                    they may produce.”</hi> Referring to the observation of the
                                Swedish note on the subject of inconveniences of restricting trade
                                upon mere presumption of ulterior consequences, M. Alvarado
                                says:</p>
                            <p>“Does, then, the Swedish government place in the rank of innocent
                                commerce, and of transactions in which activity ought to be
                                encouraged, the sale of ships-of-the-line to private individuals,
                                who offer none of the guarantees which are given by nations and
                                governments? Are these terrible instruments of destruction and
                                conquest to be handed over to the passions or calculations of the
                                first comer without taking any precautions that they shall not be
                                made to serve the ends of piracy?”</p>
                            <p>After this some further correspondence passed not material to the
                                present purpose, but on September 9, 1825, M. Alvarado, having
                                received final instructions from his own court, and re-enforced by
                                the representatives of France, Russia, and Prussia, delivered his
                                ultimatum. Referring to the grounds of suspicion. already set forth,
                                and the notoriety of the destination of the vessels, he adds:</p>
                            <p>“However, although this point is unhappily but too clear, the
                                undersigned cannot conceal from himself that to all his
                                remonstrances the Swedish minister has opposed the observation that
                                he could only regard the matter from a commercial point of view, as
                                a sale which the twedish govenment was at liberty to make to the
                                best account that it could for the sake of Se improvement of its
                                navy.”</p>
                            <pb facs="0379" n="355" xml:id="pg_355"/>
                            <p>Against such a line of argument the Spanish minister strongly
                                remonstrates and asks whether the Swedish government really
                                proposes—</p>
                            <p>“To furnish indiscriminately vessels-of-war to the first bidder, even
                                to private individuals, without any guarantee; laying down, as it
                                should seem, the proposition that the commercial benefits of these
                                sales are of a higher order of necessity to the state than the
                                loftiest political considerations or the most respectable moral
                                obligations. If so, it would be to resolve on eluding the duties of
                                neutrality towards belligerent powers, and those of friendship and
                                alliance towards a friendly power whose subjects are in revolt. If
                                so, then insurgents and pirates would never want maritime resources,
                                for the supply of these implements of war to all sorts of persons
                                would always offer to the Swedish government sufficient commercial
                                advantages to justify their destination and intermediate speculators
                                who would mask the wrongs—commercial advantages which would be all
                                the greater, and speculators who would be all the more generous,
                                just in proportion as the operations for which they were required
                                were the more illicit.”</p>
                            <p>This final note ends by a renewal of the demand for the rescission of
                                the contract with the English firm, and threatens to consider the
                                departure of the vessels as an act of hostility on the part of the
                                Swedish government.</p>
                            <p>On the 1st of November, 1825, the rescission of the contract was
                                formally announced in the Swedish <hi rend="italic">Official
                                    Gazette.</hi> The contract purported to be dissolved at the
                                instance of the purchasers, whose consent, however, was obtained by
                                the offer of liberal terms, as they received $9,000 from the Swedish
                                government for giving up their bargain, and so the affair peaceably
                                concluded.</p>
                            <p>Now, assuming this precedent to be well founded in principle, let us
                                see what it does and what it does not establish. I need not point
                                out to those of your readers who have paid any attention to this
                                kind of questions the capital distinction between a transaction like
                                that in the Swedish case, in which the government of a neutral
                                country is itself a party to the transaction, and a mere sale of
                                munitions of war by a subject of that government without its
                                privity. The sale of the vessels to the English firm by the Swedish
                                government was an act in itself clearly lawful. A sale by the
                                Swedish government to the South American republics would have been
                                equally clearly unlawful. The importance of this case is in showing
                                upon what sort of evidence the Swedish government was bound to take
                                notice that the sale, though apparently legitimate, was yet, from
                                the circumstances of the case, not permissible. It is only in this
                                way that it can be made applicable to the questions which at present
                                engage public attention. It does not aid us to any degree in
                                determining whether, under the foreign enlistment act or otherwise,
                                the equipment of a vessel-of-war by a subject of the neutral
                                government for a belligerent state is or is not an act which it is
                                the duty of the neutral government to prohibit and prevent, or
                                whether it is one which, like the sale of any other munition of war,
                                the neutral government may permit its subjects to engage in at their
                                own risk. But the question which has been recently raised divides
                                itself into two branches. First, are the sale and equipment of a
                                vessel-of-war for the account of a belligerent, acts which a
                                government ought to prohibit and prevent in its subjects directly?
                                Secondly, if this ought to be prohibited if the sale be direct to
                                the belligerent, can the obligation be evaded and the responsibility
                                declined by the colorable interposition of a third party to whom the
                                prohibition does not personally apply, but who there is good reason
                                to think is acting only as a channel for the accomplishment of the
                                illegal intent? It is to this second head exclusively that the
                                Swedish precedent applies itself. Assuming it to be established that
                                the equipment of a ship-of-war for a belligerent is by the municipal
                                law as much prohibited to the subject of a neutral state as it
                                unquestionably is by international law forbidden to the neutral
                                government itself, then the Swedish case shows that the
                                responsibility of seeing that this prohibition is not eluded cannot
                                be got rid of by the mere device of a sale to a merchant professing
                                to purchase on his own account, but which the circumstances make it
                                morally clear is really on account of the belligerent. The whole
                                question is one of agency. <hi rend="italic">Qui facit per alium
                                    facit</hi>
                                <pb facs="0380" n="356" xml:id="pg_356"/>
                                <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> The question is whether the purchase
                                is <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> what it purports to be, or is it
                                only a device for accomplishing indirectly what would not be
                                permitted directly? Whether we ought or ought not to permit our
                                ship-builders to construct steam rams for the confederate
                                authorities may be a matter of dispute on which there is a good deal
                                to be said on both sides. But this is quite clear, that if the thing
                                cannot and may not be done openly, it ought not to be allowed to be
                                done covertly. If the steam rams cannot be lawfully consigned to
                                President Davis, they cannot lawfully be sold to any person who is,
                                to all intent’s and purposes, Mr. Davis’s agent, whether he call
                                himself a French merchant or take any other shape or designation.
                                This is the common sense and common justice which receives an apt
                                illustration in the Swedish case. The principal value of the
                                precedent is as an example of the sort of evidence which ought to be
                                offered and demanded in order to establish the obligation on the
                                neutral government of taking notice of the existence of such an
                                unlawful agency at work in a contract <hi rend="italic">prima
                                    facie</hi> lawful. In this point of view it is well worthy of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            despatch No. 34, of December 1. I enclose notice of the establishment of
                            a new light called Haradskiür.</p>
                        <p>The-all absorbing question here is the federal execution in Holestein.
                            This government is making strenuous efforts to curb the warlike impulse
                            and natural sympathy of the Swedes and Norwegians for their imperilled
                            kingdom in Denmark, beseeching aid. They assume the position that the
                            quarrel now pending between Denmark and Germany concerned the London
                            treaty of 1852, and Sweden cannot separate herself from the other powers
                            who signed that treaty, they having equal responsibility to enforce its
                            observance. Should the execution extend to Schleswig, Danish territory,
                            and not a part or member of the Germanic confederation, this government
                            must and will yield to the demand of the peoples, for their unanimity
                            will be similar to the great uprising of the north, succeeding the first
                            hostile shot at Fort Sumter. As evidence of the public pulse, you read
                            in the non-official papers statements like this: “The King has taken a
                            decided resolution with regard to Schleswig Holstein, and notes were
                            despatched to the great powers yesterday, informing them of his
                            intentions.” Again: “Twenty-two thousand Swedes are coming, the King
                            accompanies them in person”—placing the government in the awkward fix of
                            denying the truth of these statements in the official papers. There is
                            no doubt the King is with the nation, and they well know his intense
                            desire to “flesh his maiden sword.” Military zeal, ambition, and ardor
                            are rampant. Great activity prevails in all the Swedish military
                            establishments. These northmen, slow to anger, when once aroused are not
                            easily pacified; their great fear is not of danger, but the cost of war.
                            The north is poor comparatively, and dreads debt.</p>
                        <p>It was thought at first that England would be more prompt in espousing
                            the cause of Denmark, and no doubt it is owing to the pressure and
                            influence of England in Stockholm and Copenhagen that the position has
                            been assumed that federal execution in Holstein—a part of the Germanic
                            confederation by <pb facs="0381" n="357" xml:id="pg_357"/> order of the
                            Diet—is not of itself a “<hi rend="italic">casus belli;”</hi> and in
                            accord with this phase or understanding, I have no doubt the Danish
                            troops will fall back, and withdraw from Holstein as the corps of
                            execution enter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The American rebellion and Polish
                            insurrection are lost sight of like an old song, almost forgotten, by
                            the superior attraction and deep interest excited by the universal,
                            marvellous, and mysterious agitation of the great German nation. Many
                            are the causes assigned. The question naturally asked is, is all this
                            the result of an outlying German duchy having a personal union with the
                            kingdom of Denmark, whose king is a German prince? <hi rend="italic"
                                >No</hi> is the reply. It is a question of “German nationality.” The
                            Germans have ventured on this <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> movement
                            only as a prelude to a general movement or revolution, Germany takes up
                            in 1864 her revolution where it came to an end in 1848. Failing then,
                            anxious once more to renew the contest with her rulers, she is now again
                            setting up the old war-cry of Schleswig-Holstein. The question of the
                            Danish succession—the claims of the newly proclaimed duke—has little to
                            do with the matter at issue. The attack is made upon Denmark, but the
                            blow is aimed at Prussia and Austria. No wonder, therefore, if these
                            powers evince hesitation and mistrust, having so much at stake in the
                            matter, so much to fear from enemies both at home and abroad. It is said
                            that a majority of the Diet, coinciding with the nation or revolutionary
                            element, (though from other motives,) have <hi rend="italic"
                                >ulterior</hi> objects not avowed; hence the glimpse Prussia and
                            Austria <hi rend="italic">now</hi> have of the “nether fires” of
                            revolution, endangering the stability of their power, if not their very
                            existence, works powerfully for peace.</p>
                        <p>The second identical note forwarded by Austria and Prussia to the other
                            German powers is strong evidence of the apprehensions they feel, the
                            peril of the crisis to which they have arrived. The “central committee,”
                            national or self-appointed, says the identical note, in the following
                            strong and threatening language,</p>
                        <p>“Claims the right of acting for Germany, and of directing the movements
                            of the other associations or unions. Free corps, corps of gymnasts,
                            &amp;c., have been formed for revolutionary purposes; in fact Germany
                            has become a hotbed of revolution. The federal laws of 1854 furnish
                            means for keeping associations like those above mentioned within due
                            bounds. The committee of thirty-six cannot possibly be tolerated, and
                            the representatives of Austria and Prussia at the Bund are instructed to
                            urge the federal governments strictly to uphold their authority, and to
                            take care that peace and order are maintained in Germany.”</p>
                        <p>In conclusion it is almost unnecessary to speculate at this late date. In
                            a few days acts will speak louder than mere words or idle suppositions;
                            the hostile armies are on either bank of the Eider; an immediate
                            withdrawal or settlement must take place, or the clash of resounding
                            arms will startle Europe, unless the German nation are constituted
                            differently from the rest of mankind.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The Germans having taken possession of the
                            telegraphic lines through Holstein, Sweden is cut off from all
                            communication with the outer world by lightning. Postal communication is
                            interrupted to such an extent that this government has extemporized a
                            postal line with the German shore of the Baltic, the ordinary channel
                            through Denmark being closed by the army of execution.</p>
                        <p>Sweden, most anxious to do all in her power, will give no material aid to
                            Denmark without the co-operation or in conjunction with England, knowing
                            that the assistance that they could render would be comparatively small
                            as against united Germany, only tending to raise to the highest pitch of
                            frenzy the spirit of nationality now so rampant in central Europe. It is
                            also well understood that England will not interfere by force, if the
                            war can be localized. Now comes the all-important question, Will Austria
                            and Prussia retire from the duchies, after Denmark has complied with
                            their demand? Will they adhere and observe in spirit the treaty of 1852?
                            Will Schleswig be returned to Denmark subject only to the condition that
                            the union between her and Denmark shall be merely personal? Will Austria
                            and Prussia counteract the revolution which they themselves have
                            created, and remit Schleswig to the position which she occupied with
                            reference to Denmark before the promulgation of the constitution of
                            November last? These are questions which time must answer. For myself I.
                            doubt if Austria and Prussia were willing whether they would dare to
                            face the full torrent of popular indignation the act of withdrawing
                            would excite throughout all Germany; and yet, to the dispassionate
                            observer, Austria and Prussia are<hi rend="italic"> par excellence</hi>
                            the opponents of the doctrine of nationality, justifying for years their
                            act or claim of imposing the “rule of the hated foreigner” on subject
                            races upon the faith of treaties, possession, and conquest. Again, the
                            attitude of France has been most encouraging for the expression of
                            intense nationality in Germany—with what object, only they who read the
                            future as an open book can tell.</p>
                        <p>From the published correspondence (in the American papers) of C. A. L.
                            Lamar, in his letter to John F. M’Cauley, a wealthy citizen of San
                            Francisco, California, formerly of Missouri, who emigrated from Western
                            Virginia some fifteen or twenty years ago, you would suppose that
                            Captain Maffit, accompanied by an engineer, was in Stockholm, or some
                            part of Sweden, in October last. Such was not the case; he met and
                            examined the steamer Carl the X, in Copenhagen, paying to the English
                            purchaser $115,000 in the bonds of the confederacy, or what is better
                            known as the fifteen-million loan, at twenty-seven cents (27 cents) on
                            the dollar, amounting to over $400,000 in bonds; also, as collateral
                            security, pledging cotton in the State of Georgia, the property of
                            Lamar, Son &amp; Co.</p>
                        <p>I have perused with that care and attention due the importance of the
                            subject the communication of B. F. Tefft, ex-consul of the United States
                            of America, to the Hon. F. W. Seward, Assistant Secretary of State, as
                            to the probability “that the rebels will next turn their attention to
                            Sweden for the purpose of supplying themselves with war vessels and
                            other armaments.” While I admit the general correctness of Mr. Tefft’s
                            statement, I cannot admit his conclusion as to the necessity of the
                            employment of a special detective agent, “who will be able, by careful
                            watching of all suspicious movements, to embarrass, if not to arrest,
                            unfriendly operations in the Swedish ship-yards and foundries.” As I do
                            not believe the apprehended danger would justify my supporting his
                            recommendation, I am free to say, I partly think the expenditure already
                            incurred by this legation was almost unnecessary. As I have often
                            informed you, <pb facs="0383" n="359" xml:id="pg_359"/> sir, the
                            Scandinavians are warm friends of our government, our institutions, and
                            the Union; we had their sympathy from the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>,
                            and have it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. They are intensely hostile to
                            slavery in every form and name—under every disguise; and I wish to do no
                            act expressive of unnecessary distrust, unless absolutely required.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor also to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 35,
                            of December 3, 1864.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Count Manderström, minister of foreign
                            affairs, has rendered himself obnoxious to the war party and populace of
                            Stockholm by his advocacy of armed neutrality (for the present) in the
                            war now raging in Denmark. On Sunday last, the 6th of March, a large
                            meeting, previously announced, was held by the friends of Denmark in
                            favor of immediate action, at which resolutions were adopted by
                            acclamation: First, that the cause of Denmark was just. Second, that the
                            interests of Denmark and Sweden were identical. Third, that Sweden was
                            anxious and ready to give national aid in men and money to the extent of
                            her ability. Fourth, they called upon the government to take prompt
                            action before it was too late—before Denmark was crashed by the mere
                            force of numbers. In the evening the populace assembled in the square of
                            Gustavus Adolphus, to the number of three or four thousand, to express
                            their approval of the resolutions of the meeting. Afterwards they
                            paraded through the principal streets, cheering in front of the palace
                            and before the residence of the Danish minister; hooting and other
                            evidences of dislike under the windows of the ministers of Prussia and
                            Austria. They then in mass proceeded to the residence of Count
                            Manderström, before which they remained until long after midnight,
                            calling Count M., in ridicule, the “great minister of war,” and other
                            names of opprobrium common to excited <ref target="http://multitud.es"
                                >multitudes</ref>, but doing no act of violence. On Monday, the 7th,
                            it was rumored through the city that a more violent demonstration of
                            dislike would be made against Count Manderström that evening. On Monday
                            morning I had my customary conference with Count Manderström; he
                            informed me he had no apprehensions of danger; that he mingled with the
                            crowd the evening previous, to whom he was well known; no personal
                            violence was offered or insulting language used to him by any one; that
                            a mob in Sweden were good-natured and kept within the law, which
                            apparently was the fact, as I never saw a more polite, well-behaved,
                            orderly assembly than that of Sunday night. On Monday night, about 7
                            o’clock, the crowd commenced collecting in front of the hotel of Count
                            Manderström, and as they increased in number they became more violent in
                            language, employing terms of reproach the most contemptuous and
                            scurrilous, and then proceeded to acts by smashing in the windows with
                            stones. The military were called out, but before their arrival two
                            fire-engines were ordered to play on the assembled multitude, which
                            created much merriment, and seemed by magic to divert the riotous from
                            the object of their gathering, changing the current of their feelings
                            into a new channel, and before the military arrived, or with their
                            arrival, they quietly dispersed. Neither on Sunday nor Monday was a blow
                            struck; a few arrests were made by the police, but no personal violence
                            on either side. On Tuesday (yesterday) <pb facs="0384" n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360"/> the city was in great ferment. It was said and
                            feared that the mob, emboldened by previous impunity, would now proceed
                            to acts of great outrage. During the day the mayor of the city issued
                            his proclamation, warning the public that no crowds would be suffered to
                            collect in the squares or streets; that they would be dispersed by
                            force, with infantry and cavalry, also calling on all good citizens to
                            assist in preserving the peace. The precautions taken and measures
                            adopted by the city authorities were most excellent. As fast as the
                            rioters arrived in the square of Gustaf Adolph they were arrested, or
                            permitted, on their promise, to return home, so that at no time were
                            they able to collect to the number of twenty-five. To-day all
                            apprehensions have subsided, so complete was the failure of the
                            demonstration on the part of the riotous last night, and so thorough the
                            victory of the authorities.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty leaves Stockholm on Friday, March 10, to open a special
                            session of the Norwegian Storthing, in Christiana, assembled by his
                            Majesty’s proclamation, to take into consideration the present
                            complications in the north of Europe, and provide for the defence of
                            Norway. No Norwegian troops can be marched out of Norway (even for the
                            defence of Sweden) without the previous consent of the Storthing, nor
                            can the navy be employed for offensive purposes without the same
                            permission. In other words, so thin is the thread which connects Sweden
                            and Norway (outside of identical interests) that a declaration of war by
                            Sweden against a foreign power does not necessarily commit or involve
                            Norway; a declaration of war must also be made by the King of Norway,
                            with the sanction of the Storthing, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                                versa.</hi></p>
                        <p>There are indications that the German powers are somewhat dissatisfied
                            with the results of the invasion of Denmark. Austria is said to be
                            especially discontented. Most strenuous are the efforts made (except by
                            France) to bring the war to a speedy conclusion, for it is most evident
                            should the war be prolonged through the spring and summer it will
                            involve all Europe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch, No. 36, of February 23, 1864, and am most
                            happy to reply that your advice, by the authority of the President, “I
                            recommend to you the practice of prudence and reserve in the excited
                            debates by which you are now surrounded,” has been my will of action in
                            the past, and will be implicitly pursued now, confirmed by your
                            instructions in the future. I am a mere “looker on here in Vienna,” and
                            report to you, sir, the impressions of passing events, mixing facts with
                            inferences, leaving to your superior judgment and information to draw
                            correct conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The heart of Sweden and Norway palpitates in sympathetic accord with
                            their brethren of Denmark, resisting with stout courage the force of
                            apparently irresistible numbers. I feel for this brave nation; their
                            past history appeals to the general student, their present to all
                            advocates of republican institutions.</p>
                        <p>Throughout Sweden and Norway relief societies and aid committees are
                            formed to collect money, clothing, &amp;c., to which all contribute. The
                            sufferings of the Danish army have been and are intense; from my own
                            observation, the powers <pb facs="0385" n="361" xml:id="pg_361"/> of
                            this stout northern race surpass all belief; they are out in all
                            weather—as thoroughly at home in snow and ice as in rain and mud. They
                            are no unworthy descendants of those Cimbriâns who astonished the Romans
                            of Marius so many centuries since, by sporting half naked in the snow
                            and making sledges of their shields to slide down the icy slopes of the
                            Alps—a rehearsal of the frolics they were wont to indulge in at their
                            northern home, and a custom, in all its ancient primitive simplicity,
                            retained to this day. Of the excellence of the Danish troops no doubt
                            can be entertained. The rigor of the climate seems to make no impression
                            upon them. The fact is, the Scandinavians are all educated, highly
                            civilized men; they have a self-respect and dignity which stand them
                            instead of the most efficient discipline; and they are treated by their
                            superiors with a familiar friendliness which could only be safely shown
                            to men who know their places. The Danes are anxious for a fair trial of
                            strength with their enemies, and the mere apprehension of a cessation of
                            hostilities is gall and wormwood to them. They think that the advantages
                            of their present position fully counterbalance the fearful numerical
                            odds by which they might so easily have been overwhelmed at the famous
                            Dannewerk, though, I must confess, to me it looks like “hoping against
                            hope.”</p>
                        <p>The Germans have now the whole of Schleswig in their hands, except the
                            petty island of Alsen and the four square miles of ground adjoining it
                            on the mainland. That the position of Dybböl and the island are strong
                            and formidable, and that the Germans are aware of its strength is a
                            matter of certainty, for they turned all their endeavors against it in
                            1849, when it had hardly more than its natural advantages to rely upon,
                            and were driven from it again and again. They appear to dread an
                            assault, and the slaughter and loss it must entail, and seem disposed to
                            resort to the tedium and delay of a regular siege in preference. What
                            European complications may take place from this war, if prolonged—a war,
                            the origin of which is so shrouded in words that no two men can agree as
                            to its cause, purpose, object, demands, or probable conclusion— who can
                            say? England, on two separate occasions, has inflicted much evil and
                            great wrong on the little kingdom of Denmark. Yet England only (with
                            Sweden) has entreated, remonstrated, expostulated, but been seconded by
                            none. No nation in Europe was so faithful and suffered so much for
                            Napoleon the Great as Denmark—the last to desert the fallen fortunes of
                            the empire—but the ties of gratitude for old and disinterested services
                            do not move France. A single word from the Emperor would have prevented
                            the invasion of the duchies. For what reason that word was not spoken
                            events must tell. The Germans are now quarrelling among themselves, and
                            of the two contingencies it seems more probable that the present year
                            will see a revolution in Germany than witness the dismemberment of
                            Denmark.</p>
                        <p>With the departure of the King and his ministers to Christiania, all
                            demonstrations on the part of the populace have subsided, and quiet is
                            restored once more to this most peacable capital.</p>
                        <p>One word more as to the question of Scandinavian union, and the creation
                            of a great northern power, of which much has been said and written. From
                            all I can see, hear, and learn, there is not the most remote probability
                            of such a result. In the three kingdoms the advocates of union are few
                            and destitute of importance. The question of. the <hi rend="italic"
                                >capital</hi> would be a “bone of contention” always existing, ever
                            irritating; but more than all, the old union of Calmar, and its fearful
                            consequences, loom up portentously before the vision of every Swede.</p>
                        <p>By telegram we learn that the Norwegian special session of the Storthing
                            adjourns next Thursday, and that they have made all the appropriations
                            for military and naval purposes recommended by his Majesty. They also
                            express their great sympathy for Denmark, and approve of the conduct of
                            the government in not taking separate action, but doing all in their
                            power, in conjunction with England, to aid Denmark. From this action of
                            the Storthing indorsing the policy of the <pb facs="0386" n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362"/> present ministry, Sweden and Norway will give no
                            material aid to Denmark except in joint action with other powers, or at
                            least with England. What restrains them now is prudence, and the
                            knowledge that their aid alone would he futile, tending to unite and
                            excite Germany to greater exertion.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The public mind at the present moment is in a state of expectation,
                            waiting the result of the London conference on the Danish question.
                            There appeared a universal desire in all classes that the proposition of
                            Lord Clarendon should be accepted; that is, that Denmark should yield up
                            the duchies of Holsteine Lauenburg; and the German portion of Schleswig,
                            thus cutting off all its German possessions, relations and duties, as a
                            member of the Germanic confederation, and be only Danish. This wish on
                            the part of the Swedes may spring from the hope that Denmark, thus
                            reduced in size and importance, will soon gravitate and be incorporated
                            into a united Scandinavia, constituting a powerful nation; a
                            consummation longed for by the enthusiastic, the students, and the
                            literary classes of the three kingdoms; but I fear the question of the
                            capital, Stockholm <hi rend="italic">vs.</hi> Copenhagen, would be
                            troublesome to decide, almost insurmountable, if not, in fact, the rock
                            on which union would split. Again, the spirit of the Danes is yet
                            strong. They are not disposed to accept thankfully, on the
                            recommendation of friends or foes, the dismemberment and disintegration
                            of an ancient monarchy that has successfully braved the storms of a
                            thousand years, remained intact in spite of all political convulsions;
                            and now a kingdom is to be broken up which has stood its ground for
                            centuries, provinces are to be taken from it, which were secured by long
                            prescription—by the faith of repeated treaties. No wonder the Danes say,
                            and think, that the treatment they have received and are now receiving
                            from the hands of the great powers of Europe is the great scandal of our
                            age.</p>
                        <p>The government of Sweden are now building three monitors after the
                            American model, at their national works at Motalda. They received the
                            plans and drawings (if I am not misinformed) from Captain Ericsson two
                            years ago. They expect to improve greatly on the celebrated original. I
                            have no doubt they will, for they study long and closely, make
                            experiments, elaborate every part before expenditure, and their
                            scientific and practical knowledge of naval affairs need not shrink from
                            comparison with the most advanced nation.</p>
                        <p>The secretary of naval affairs, Count Platen, has spoken to me several
                            times of the handsome manner in which the officers and crew of the
                            Sweedish man-of-war were entertained by the officers and employés of the
                            United States in New York and elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>The conference has dissolved; the German-Danish war is renewed. This was
                            anticipated for some time, and has taken none by surprise.</p>
                        <p>The renunciation of the Emperor of Russia of all his rights as head of
                            the house of Holstein Gottorp, in favor of the Grand Duke of Oldenburg,
                            seems to be in favor and in support of the policy of Prussia, that
                            desires to set up a rival for her own <hi rend="italic">purposes</hi> to
                            the claim of the Duke of Augustenbourg to Schleswig-Holstein; and while
                            the Diet of the Germanic confederation are discussing and deciding in
                            solemn deliberations the merits of the contending claimants, (requiring
                            years, according to German precedents, to decide correctly so grave and
                            weighty a question,) Prussia, in possession of <hi rend="italic"
                                >that</hi> she most covets, will Prussianise, incorporate, and
                            absorb the duchies within herself, make a reality of her brightest dream
                            by the creation of a German fleet, and then hold and retain the duchies
                            by the right of conquest and possession. This seems the most rational
                            explanation of the conduct and renewal of the war on the part of
                            Prussia.</p>
                        <p>Sweden, though far from an indifferent spectator to the struggle, is well
                            aware that alone she can give no efficient aid to Denmark—that her
                            assistance would do no good; but, on the contrary, excite German
                            nationality to fever-heat. But Sweden has always been ready and prepared
                            to join and assist England at a moment’s notice in aught that England
                            may propose to do for Denmark.</p>
                        <p>A short time will decide if the war will extend beyond its present and
                            former limits. Will the German powers rest content with the three
                            duchies, or will they attack the island of Laland, Funen, and Zeland? If
                            so, will England send a fleet to protect them? This is now the most
                            important question. Its solution will remove much uncertainty and
                            speculation now existing.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of despatches Nos. 42 and 43. Copious extracts of the
                            communication of the Secretary of State upon the subject of an
                            intercontinental telegraph by the way of Behring’s strait, in reply to
                            the chairman of the Committee on Commerce of the United States Senate,
                            were made and published in the Stockholm papers, as a subject in which
                            Sweden was greatly interested. One article expressed surprise that the
                            first minister of the United States government, in the midst of a great
                            civil war, had the time and disposition to employ his mind to so
                            critical and exact a statistical and geographical examination of the
                            subject.</p>
                        <pb facs="0388" n="364" xml:id="pg_364"/>
                        <p>I have not received the silver medal which the President has directed to
                            be presented to Captain M. F. Broman, of the Swedish ship Atlantic, for
                            his humane services to the shipwrecked crew of the American schooner
                            Gamaliel, in April last. When received I will, as instructed, to the
                            best of my ability, convey this testimonial in an appropriate
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>No one doubts but the suspension of hostilities between Denmark and the
                            German powers must result in peace—that Denmark has no hope but in the
                            generosity of the victors. The fortune of war has rendered submission
                            inevitable, and Denmark must accept the conditions which the German
                            powers may see fit to dictate. It has been suggested that the integrity
                            of the Danish monarchy may yet be preserved by a short and easy road of
                            escape—its absorption into the Germanic confederation; and as a member
                            of the confederation, ranking third in power and importance—in fact,
                            holding the balance of power in the Diet between Austria and
                            Prussia—this union or absorption would be in harmony with the views of a
                            large party in Germany.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 17th of July an attack was made by Prussian troops
                            upon the Norwegian royal mail steamer Vicken, sailing from Christiania
                            to Lubeck, while landing passengers as usual at Frederickshaven, in
                            Jutland. Count Manderström informed me, yesterday, he understood the
                            Prussian officer in command pleads a mistake for his excuse—that the
                            Vicken was taken for a Danish steamer; but as yet he, Count Manderström,
                            had received no reply from the Prussian government to his demand for
                            explanation.</p>
                        <p>A much deeper feeling, and far more painful, was excited throughout
                            Norway and Sweden by the order of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia,
                            that “all foreign officers and volunteers taken prisoners, who were not
                            regularly enrolled in the Danish army, would be tried by court-martial,
                            and on conviction, <hi rend="italic">duly shot.</hi> Count Manderström
                            informed me the order was <hi rend="italic">suspended,</hi> but <hi
                                rend="italic">not revoked;</hi> that he had received no reply to his
                            communication on the subject from the Prussian government; that he had
                            no fear that captured Swedes, &amp;c., would be treated otherwise than
                            as prisoners of war; that it was a European, question, in which all
                            civilized nations were interested. I was struck with the emphatic
                            declaration, as if he wished me to take note and be witness, that the
                            order of Prince Frederick Charles was infamous. He remarked the same to
                            several of my colleagues. It is understood that Austria protested
                            against this order of her ally; for, as is well known, the Austrian
                            imperial service is sought and has the preference with foreigners of
                            distinction and all military adventurers, having for more than one
                            hundred years a larger number of alien officers in her service than all
                            the armies of Europe combined.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of December 4, No. 70, has
                            been received. I learn from it that the imperial government is
                            understood to be preparing the way for a secularization of property held
                            by ecclesiastics in mortmain, with a view to apply its avails to the
                            highest objects of civil administration. This measure seems to become
                            ultimately necessary in every country where ecclesiastical sway has been
                            allowed to become and remain for a long time absolute.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the policy may be ejected without subjecting the
                            empire to the dangers of intestine war.</p>
                        <p>It is not wonderful that the Turkish statesmen study with care and
                            anxiety he political movements of the western powers. I suppose I shall
                            be offering <pb facs="0390" n="366" xml:id="pg_366"/> nothing new to you
                            when I express the opinion that the best security that Turkey can take
                            against foreign ambition will be found in the melioration of her own
                            system, and its gradual assimilation to that of other commercial and
                            industrial nations. No power is more desirous or more hopeful of her
                            success in this policy than the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your three despatches, all dated the 4th ultimo, and numbered
                            68, 69, and 70. The information communicated in the latter, concerning
                            the removal of the Shiek-ul-Islam, is very interesting and
                            instructive.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * ** *</p>
                        <p>The arrest of Mustook Pacha is a gratifying event, and attests the energy
                            of your exertions to prevent a repetition of such outrages as the late
                            assassinations of the Reverend Mr. Coffing and the Reverend Mr. Merriam.
                            It is hoped that your efforts to secure the arrest of the criminal
                            Kaleel may also be successful.</p>
                        <p>The pistols intended for the governor of Adrianople have at length been
                            finished, and will be sent to you by the steamer which will carry this
                            instruction, to the care of our consul at Liverpool, who will be
                            directed to transmit them to Constantinople by the safest and quickest
                            means.</p>
                        <p>The designs for the handles, which are of solid silver, (oxydized,) and
                            those on the barrels, were made by Mr. Ward, a young and promising
                            sculptor of New York, who also superintended the workmanship, which, as
                            you will perceive, is of the very finest description. In presenting them
                            to the ex-Grand Vizier, as a testimonial of the President’s appreciation
                            of the interest his highness took in the arrest and punishment of the
                            murderers of Mr. Merriam, you will use the opportunity to enforce the
                            value of such services as those rendered by him on the occasion referred
                            to, and the high estimation in which they must ever be held by the
                            government and people of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch of the 21st of August, which is not
                            numbered.</p>
                        <p>I learn with pleasure of your safe arrival, and the reassumption of your
                            official duties at Constantinople. As a friend of Turkey, the United
                            States is gratified with the evidence of successful and beneficent
                            administration which the grand council has given in an annual report to
                            the Sultan, which accompanies your despatch.</p>
                        <p>The President hears with surprise and regret rumors of abuses of the
                            privilege of granting protections committed by persons vicariously
                            exercising consular functions in behalf of this government within his
                            Imperial Majesty’s dominions. Recent improvements of administration
                            present some grounds for believing that that privilege might now be
                            relinquished without serious prejudice to the interests of the United
                            States. It is not supposed, however, that in the event of either a
                            radical change of administration, or of the recurrence of religious or
                            other domestic disturbances in the capital or the provinces, the right
                            of granting protections, as heretofore exercised, would be found
                            indispensable to the safety of citizens sojourning in Turkey. In view of
                            these opposing considerations the President has determined that you may
                            announce to the minister of foreign affairs that the power of the
                            ministers and of consuls to grant protection will, until further notice,
                            be restricted so as to allow them to issue only to persons in the actual
                            service of the United States. This restriction will not be claimed to
                            have any bearing upon passports to American citizens granted by this
                            department or other proper authority.</p>
                        <p>You will immediately give notice to the United States consuls in Turkey
                            of the modification of their powers which has thus been made, and
                            require them to conform themselves to the same.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wipperman has not been in any way molested in his functions by the
                            government of the United Principalities since the incident referred to
                            in a previous note and the correspondence between myself and the Porte
                            on the subject. I suppose that the effort of the government of Prince
                            Couza to obtain an indirect recognition of a simulated independence
                            having failed, the question raised may be considered settled. The state
                            of affairs in the Principalities has not been improved by their union,
                            and the form of government established by the convention of Paris in
                            1856. Taxation has greatly increased without any compensation in the
                            improvement of the country, and an arbitrary system of government has
                            been introduced by Prince Couza, which has on several occasions nearly
                            provoked a revolution. The Principalities, as well as Greece, instead of
                            being assisted in the way of progress by the great powers to whom the
                            former owes its partial and the latter its complete independence, have
                            been regarded by them only as centres of intrigue for the ultimate
                            dismemberment of the Ottoman empire, and its partition among themselves.
                            For this reason, in Egypt, Greece, and the Principalities, there are
                            Russian, English, Austrian, and French parties, but no party inspired by
                            local, patriotic impulses. Foreign interests are allowed to predominate,
                            and the local welfare is subordinated to the selfish schemes of the
                            great states of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Within the Ottoman empire the Christian subjects enjoy a liberty of
                            conscience that is not accorded to dissenters from the established faith
                            in some of the most enlightened kingdoms of Europe. They are entirely
                            exempt from military service. They pay but few taxes, and in most
                            respects enjoy higher privileges than the native mussulman population.
                            Many of them fill high posts of honor and profit under the government,
                            while the commerce and trade and most lucrative branches of industry are
                            in their hands. Their exemption from many of the burdens to which the
                            native subjects are liable, conjoined with the special protection they
                            enjoy in their religious belief from European powers, is, indeed, one of
                            the chief causes of the jealousy that exists against them on the part of
                            their fellow-subjects of the Mohammedan faith.</p>
                        <p>The return of the Sultan from his tour to Egypt was signalized by three
                            nights of almost universal illumination in Stamboul and the Christian
                            quarters of Galato and Pera. The American legation residence, in common
                            with all the other legations, was illuminated, and, on the night of the
                            passage of the Sultan through the streets of Para, the flag of the
                            American Union spread its ample silken folds above him in sign of
                            greeting to one of its true friends in the hour of calamity. On the day
                            of the arrival of the Sultan the whole population of Constantinople and
                            its faubourgs covered the shores and surface of the Bosphorus, and
                            welcomed him back to the capital in the most enthusiastic manner. The
                            unanimity of sentiment that pervaded this welcome, conveying, as it did,
                            an expression of unlimited confidence in the future of his reign by all
                            classes of his subjects, produced such a deep impression on the mind of
                            the Sultan as to evoke from him a special act of recognition in an
                            imperial Hatt.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish government has recently established a warehouse system. It
                            has granted to a French company a privilege of thirty years’ duration to
                            establish warehouses at Constantinople, Smyrna, Soulina, Salonica,
                            Trebisond, Samsoun, Rodosto, Enos, and Beyrout, the most important ports
                            of the empire. Goods deposited in these warehouses will not be liable
                            for duties until three months after their entrance into these
                            establishments.</p>
                        <pb facs="0393" n="369" xml:id="pg_369"/>
                        <p>The company is allowed to issue warrants on the deposit of merchandise,
                            which will form an extensive discount paper for the new bank. The credit
                            of three months in payment of duties will be of great benefit to foreign
                            commerce, and particularly to that connected with Constantinople, the
                            import and export tonnage of which last year represented a total of
                            6,584,610 tons. The government has made a free gift to the company of
                            sufficient land at the above ports for the necessary buildings.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to enclose a copy of the official journal containing the
                            charter and statutes of the New National Ottoman Bank.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p>The revenue of the Turkish government for the last year is
                                $75,000,000, against $50,000,000 for 1859. This increase is chiefly
                                owing to the large receipts from customs under the new tariff. The
                                metropolitan customs returns for January, exclusive of the spirit
                                and tobacco duties, show the receipts to have been 4,295,758
                                piastres, as against 1,327,299 piastres for January, 1862. In
                                February they were 4,385,614 piastres, against 1,664,958 piastres
                                for February, 1862. For March 4,975,477 piastres, against 2,734,093
                                piastres for February, 1862.</p>
                            <p>While writing I am informed that the Sultan has determined, within a
                                few days, to recall Fuad Pacha again to the head of affairs as grand
                                vizier. As he is the first statesman of the empire, and one of the
                                most distinguished public men of the age, this appointment gives
                                universal satisfaction. It is a proof that the Sultan is capable of
                                estimating the higher order of talent, and of rising superior to the
                                intrigues of palace cabals and the dictates of mercenary
                                partisans.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Since my last despatch Fuad Pacha has been
                            appointed grand vizier. He is also invested with the control of his late
                            post—the war department— the practical management of which is intrusted
                            to Halil Pasha. The latter has for several several years been the head
                            of the artillery bureau. He ranks high as a man of military science,
                            having been educated to his profession at Paris. Safvet Pasha, late
                            president of the supreme council of state, becomes minister of commerce,
                            his former post. He is a man of modern ideas, and of European education.
                            Edhem Pasha, late minister of commerce, has been appointed government
                            director of the New Ottoman Bank.</p>
                        <p>This change of ministry closes the contest between the progressives and
                            retrograde parties. For a time the latter gained the ascendant over the
                            mind of the Sultan, but the counsels of the representatives of the great
                            European powers neutralized their influence, and secured the return to
                            power of liberal and enlightened statesmen. The Sultan has regained
                            public confidence, and the march of affairs tranquilly pursues its
                            course.</p>
                        <p>Extensive reforms are being introduced into every branch of government,
                            which will lead to a considerable reduction in the annual expenditure. I
                            have heretofore alluded to the abuses growing out of the government of
                            the provinces. These have become so flagrant of late that the Porte has
                            appointed special commissioners to visit every province in the empire,
                            and examine into the character of their administration. These
                            commissioners have been selected from among the purest and ablest
                            statesmen of the empire. Their duty is to visit each district in the
                            province, and to carefully inquire into the complaints of the <pb
                                facs="0394" n="370" xml:id="pg_370"/> people against the
                            authorities. Peculations and corruption of the most extraordinary kind
                            have been already discovered. Extortion, plunder, and robbery have been
                            practiced with impunity for years by the provincial governors, to the
                            disturbance of the tranquillity of their pachalicks, and the detriment
                            of the imperial treasury. The severity with which these investigations
                            are pursued indicates that further mal-administration is not to-be
                            tolerated in the provinces during the present reign.</p>
                        <p>The recent note of Aali Pacha, minister of foreign affairs, on the Suez
                            canal, was rather a peace-offering to the British government than an act
                            of hostility against the work. The Porte will not insist on any of the
                            three points raised in that note. They have been advanced as objections
                            which ought to be obviated, but they will not interfere with the
                            prosecution of the enterprise. It is pushed on as vigorously as ever. It
                            is rumored that the French ambassador has signified to the Porte that
                            the Emperor Napoleon will not permit the completion of the canal to be
                            arrested in any event.</p>
                        <p>The exhibition of domestic manufactures which has been opened in Stamboul
                            for several months past, in a building constructed for the purpose on
                            the site of the ancient hippodrome, is to close with the present month.
                            It has been visited by the people generally, and has excited much
                            interest among the Turks. One portion of the building has been dedicated
                            to the exhibition of labor-saving machines of foreign invention, the
                            principal of which are for agricultural purposes. Many of these have
                            been purchased by the pashas for their cliftliks or farms, and will, in
                            all probability, mark the beginning of a new agricultural era in Turkey.
                            The Turkish manufactures on exhibition are various. The silk and woollen
                            fabrics are the only ones which display much merit. The silk stuffs of
                            Damascus, interwoven with gold threads, are distinguished for firmness
                            of texture and brilliancy of color, but are more costly than the silks
                            of France. The carpets, though not remarkable for beauty of pattern or
                            color, have a reputation for solidity and durability that renders them
                            superior to any carpets of European manufacture. Their unchangeableness
                            of color is such that no acids can affect them. The best of them wear
                            almost without change in body or color for twenty years. This part of
                            the exhibition is interesting, demonstrating, as it does, the
                            incontestable superiority of Turkey over all other countries in this
                            branch of industry. Altogether the exhibition is creditable to the
                            government, and cannot fail of exercising an important influence for
                            good.</p>
                        <p>On the frontier near Bagdad the limits between Turkey and Persia have for
                            a long period of time been a subject of dispute. Some years since a
                            survey was made by a joint commission, but the maps have not yet been
                            published. This debatable ground has recently been the scene of a
                            conflict between the Turks and Persians. The governor of Bagdad
                            regarding certain salt-beds on this tract as important to have
                            possession of, ordered a detachment of troops to drive off the Persians
                            in occupancy of them. They met a resistance, which aroused the Turkish
                            soldiers to such a fury that they massacred a large number of men,
                            women, and children. The Persian minister has demanded satisfaction of
                            the Porte. An ill feeling exists between the Persians and the Turks on
                            account of sectarian differences as followers of the prophet, and
                            serious complications may arise from this apparently insignificant
                            incident.</p>

                            <p>A most important reform in the customs administration has just been
                                decided on by the Turkish government. All of the inland
                                custom-houses, except those on the frontier, are to be abolished.
                                The revenue derived from these sources is to be commuted for a
                                uniform octroi duty to be levied upon all the towns and villages in
                                the empire. The old system was very oppressive, as all goods,
                                whether of native or foreign production, entering or leaving the
                                larger towns, paid heavy customs dues. These dues have operated to
                                the special injury of the subjects of the Sultan, as foreigners are
                                exempted by the late treaties from duties on exportation on every
                                article the product of the soil or industry of Turkey. Native
                                subjects were, at the same time, subject to a three per cent. duty
                                on removing goods from towns where custom-houses existed. The reform
                                will also incidentally benefit foreign commerce, by cheapening the
                                price of articles the traffic of which lies almost exclusively in
                                native hands.</p>
                            <p>The revenue from customs continues to exhibit a remarkable increase.
                                That for the months of March, April, May, and June, 1863, exhibits
                                an excess of 11,946 purses (500 piastres to the purse) over the
                                corresponding period of last year, or an increase of 146 per cent.
                                over the same months in 1861. This is the more striking in view of
                                the fact that the custom-house duties have, according to the new
                                treaties, been reduced one per cent.; for the present year being
                                seven per cent. The above amount does not also include the duties on
                                tobacco, salt, building timber, &amp;c., &amp;c. The chief credit
                                for this increase is due to Kiana Pasha, director general of
                                customs. Through his energy the smuggling heretofore carried on with
                                impunity in the principal ports of the empire has been to a great
                                degree extirpated, and order and efficiency introduced in every
                                branch of the revenue collection service.</p>
                            <p>In case of a European war, growing out of the Polish question, the
                                embarrassment of the Porte will be great. It will be difficult, if
                                not impossible, for it to preserve a neutral position. Should it be
                                involved in war, it may find its first enemies on the frontiers of
                                its own territory. The spirit of the governments and populations of
                                Servia, and Moldavia, and Wallachia is extremely hostile to the
                                suzerain power, and their hostility is encouraged by the secret
                                intrigues of leading European powers. They would seize upon a
                                general war <pb facs="0396" n="372" xml:id="pg_372"/> against Russia
                                as a most propitious season for achieving absolute independence and
                                of commencing the final dismemberment of the Turkish empire. If
                                successful, their example would encourage similar attempts in other
                                parts of the Sultan’s dominions.</p>
                            <p>In Servia, notwithstanding the settlement of the troubles of the last
                                year— by the agreement on the part of the Porte to withdraw the
                                mussulman population from Belgrade, and to destroy the two
                                fortresses held by the Turks in the interior of the Principality,
                                and that the mussulmans dwelling around these and the other
                                fortresses should leave the Servian territory—the Servian government
                                refuses to fulfil its part of the convention. It has not paid any
                                part of the indemnity pledged to the Turks whose houses were
                                pillaged during the troubles at Belgrade. The Porte has fulfilled
                                all its stipulations. The Prince of Servia, while limited by a
                                treaty to only such a military force as is necessary for police
                                purposes, is constantly augmenting his army. It has now reached such
                                proportions as to render it a just object of suspicion to the Porte.
                                In vain the great powers are invoked to enforce the provisions of
                                the convention of Paris, to which the Principalities owe their
                                present form of government. While publicly professing extreme
                                concern for the preservation of the integrity of the Ottoman empire,
                                most of them are secretly promoting plots for its destruction.</p>
                            <p>In view of these eventualities the Porte is steadily increasing both
                                its land and naval forces. Four vessels of war have recently been
                                constructed here, and five iron-clad frigates are in course of
                                construction—one at Constantinople and the others in England. The
                                army was never in such a high state of discipline as at present, and
                                which is maintained by frequent military exercises on a large scale
                                in open camps. The latest improvements in fire-arms have been
                                adopted in lieu of the old weapons.</p>
                            <p>Apprehensive, in the event of war, of hostilities on the part of
                                Turkey, Russia is massing a considerable force on the Asiatic
                                frontier. The Porte having asked for explanations from the
                                representative of Russia, has as yet received no satisfactory
                                answer. It may possibly be the design of Russia, if an attack should
                                be made on her own territory, to counteract the plans of the allied
                                powers by carrying war and insurrection into the Ottoman empire, and
                                thus create political complications of the gravest nature among the
                                allies themselves.</p>
                            <p>The recent signal victories of the Union arms at Gettysburg,
                                Vicksburg, and Port Hudson have been received with great
                                satisfaction by the friends of American liberty and union in Turkey.
                                To none have they given more real joy than to the members of the
                                Turkish government, all of whom, the Sultan himself included, have
                                been our steadfast friends throughout the varying phases of the
                                contest. They are looked upon as the sure presages of an early
                                restoration of the American Union.</p>
                            <p>I have received no despatch, up to the present date, since No.

                        <p>A French translation of Circular No. 39, relative to the progress of our
                            arms in the suppression of the rebellion against the Union, was
                            communicated to his Highness, Aali Pasha, minister of foreign affairs.
                            As on all occasions <pb facs="0397" n="373" xml:id="pg_373"/> when
                            allusion has been made to this subject, his Highness expressed an
                            earnest desire for the triumph of the Union cause, and his satisfaction
                            at the steady progress which had been made towards the achievement of
                            that result from the commencement of the war to the present time. His
                            views are those of all the members of the imperial cabinet,
                            notwithstanding the zealous efforts of my disloyal predecessor to
                            prejudice the government of the Sultan in favor of the rebellion by
                            false statements as to the true origin and nature of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>As the exhibition of our resources, population, and actual condition is
                            of importance in demonstrating the wealth of the country and power of
                            the government, and in giving proper ideas of our capacity for future
                            development and growth, I recently presented, on my own account, to the
                            Grand Vizier, the minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of
                            commerce, a French edition of Mr. Consul Bigelow’s admirable work,
                            entitled “The United States of America in 1863.” I know of no work in
                            the French language which presents such a condensed yet satisfactory
                            account of the agricultural and mineral resources of the United States,
                            of our progress in arts and arms, and of our political institutions, and
                            of our power as a nation. The chapter on the conflict between free and
                            slave labor is a brief but instructive summary of the true character of
                            that struggle.</p>
                        <p>These distinguished functionaries assured me that the gift was to them a
                            very acceptable one, as the subject-matter was to them peculiarly
                            interesting, about which it was difficult to obtain reliable
                            information. I have also distributed copies of the work to several other
                            influential persons, and I am satisfied it will do much good.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that my
                            efforts to bring Mustook Pasha, the Caimacam (lieutenant governor) of
                            Payas, to justice, have at length been crowned with success. Since I
                            first learned that he had given protection to one of the assassins of
                            the Rev. Mr. Coffing, of the name of Kaleel, I have been unremitting in
                            exertions to enforce him to the delivery of the criminal. Failing in
                            this, owing to the impunity with which this functionary has been enabled
                            to defy the Porte audits authority in his mountain-fastnesses, I have
                            from time to time caused vizerial orders to be issued to the governor of
                            Adana to secure the arrest of Kaleel, through representations to the
                            Pasha of the earnest wishes of the Porte on this subject. At one time
                            the Porte, at my request, removed Mustook Pasha from office, but he was
                            restored on the protest of Caleduli Effendi, the commissioner in Syria,
                            who deemed his removal at that time as dangerous to the peace of that
                            part of Syria.</p>
                        <p>Persisting in his determination not to surrender Kaleel, who is a near
                            relative to his wife, the Porte at last resolved to assert its authority
                            in the most decided manner. On the 2d of November last Mustook Pasha was
                            arrested at Payas, by order of the governor of Adana, with the
                            co-operation of Husni Pasha, who, at the head of a large body of troops,
                            seized him in his own territory, to which he had repaired under pretence
                            of aiding the Caimacam in the apprehension of robbers. All his family
                            except one son were taken, and have been sent to the capital. The arrest
                            of this notorious Pasha, who for the last fifteen years has <pb
                                facs="0398" n="374" xml:id="pg_374"/> been the terror of the people
                            of Alexandretta and its vicinity, from his own ruffianism, and the
                            protection which he has accorded to fugitives from justice, has been a
                            subject of great rejoicing among the mussulman and Christian population.
                            It is hailed as a pledge of the restoration of law and order in one of
                            the most troubled provinces of the empire.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen from the enclosed translation of a letter from
                            Vice-Consul Levy to our consul at Beyrout, that this arrest is
                            attributed to my exertions, which I allude to only as showing that
                            American influence is recognized in such a remote part of the empire in
                            a way which honors the American name in the estimation of men of all
                            races and creeds.</p>
                        <p>I need not assure you that I shall not give up the pursuit of the
                            assassin Kaleel and shall continue to have instructions issued by the
                            Porte from time to time to all the civil and military authorities for
                            his apprehension. There will be no security for travellers in Syria so
                            long as criminals like Kaleel are permitted to escape the penalty of
                            their crimes through the connivance of the local governors. In this
                            persevering effort to accomplish justice, I am satisfied I am most
                            properly representing the vigorous and liberal tone of the
                            administration of President Lincoln, which expects from its foreign
                            representatives the strictest performance of duty in the protection of
                            American life.</p>
                        <p>In this connexion, I beg respectfully to remind the department that the
                            pair of pistols promised in one of your despatches to ex-Grand Vizier
                            Kibrisili Pasha, governor of Adrianople, for the interest he took in the
                            arrest and punishment of the murderers of the Rev. Mr. Merriam, have not
                            yet been received.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Consul:</hi>My telegraphic despatch of the
                            2d, by way of Aleppo, advised you that Mustook Pasha, two of his sons,
                            (for one has escaped,) and Yusef Bey, his cousin, were arrested at Pay
                            as, the 2d ultimo, by order of his excellency Ali Riza, Pasha of Adana,
                            through the instrumentality of Husni Pasha, despatched from Aleppo at
                            the head of 1,800 soldiers. At the invitation of the Pasha of Adana,
                            Mustook Pasha repaired to that place a week ago; but not having been
                            able to pay up his arrears to the Porte, now fifteen years standing, he
                            left Adana alone as he entered it. The pasha not being satisfied with
                            his extremely vague promises, two days after despatched Husni to Payas,
                            and there, by stratagem, Mustook Pasha was made prisoner, with his
                            suite. He is at present at Alexandretta, under a guard of 200 regular
                            soldiers, to remain until the arrival of the Russian steamer of Sunday
                            next, by which he is to be taken to Constantinople under a strong
                            escort.</p>
                        <p>It is unnecessary to say to you, Monsieur le Consul, <hi rend="italic"
                                >that the country attributes this capture to the influence of our
                                minister at Constantinople;</hi> and that it is generally believed
                            that the mountain will be more sure now that Mustook Pasha is
                            arrested.</p>
                        <p>I have taken several steps of late in relation to Kaleel. I know that he
                            is near Ali Bekir Oglu. I am on his track, but the capture of Mustook
                            will probably defeat my plans. I do not despair, however, to be able
                            eventually to take him. On this I will speak further in my next.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> An event of no ordinary importance having
                            recently taken place, I deem it my duty to make special mention of it.
                            Last week the Sheik-ul-Islam, whose authority may he best represented by
                            stating that he combines the powers of the Lord High Chancellor and
                            Archbishop of Canterbury, was removed from office. The reasons assigned
                            for this deposition render the occurrence the more remarkable.</p>
                        <p>As no law can be put in force until it has received the sanction of this
                            dignitary, it is in his power to control the legislation of the empire.
                            It appears that the late Sheik-ul-Islam was a mussulman of the strictest
                            sect, and that he was a firm opponent of the reformatory measures of the
                            government, which, for the sake of self-preservation, it has found it
                            necessary to adopt. On several occasions he put his negative on
                            important laws, as conflicting with the spirit and letter of the Koran.
                            He was known, also, to be opposed to the schemes of the government with
                            relation to the Vakouf property, having declared that he could never
                            give his assent to the secularization of the ecclesiastical property
                            known under this title.</p>
                        <p>As the appropriation of the Vakouf property to the uses of the state is
                            of almost absolute necessity in its present condition of the treasury,
                            the Sultan summarily dismissed the supreme judge of law and religion
                            from office, and appointed another, who is expected to interpret the
                            Koran in conformity with the liberal spirit of the age and the
                            necessities of the government. Such an event at one time would have
                            raised the Ulemas and the whole body of the Mohammedan priesthood
                            against the government, and would have led to a revolution. Now it
                            occurs without exciting any visible discontent.</p>
                        <p>The Vakouf represent property which is either held in the name of the
                            mosques, or belongs to them as absolute property. For the sake of
                            security individuals convey the titles of property to mosques, with the
                            understanding, however, that the possession is to remain in the hands of
                            the original owner, on condition of his paying a certain annual rent.
                            The owner can make such disposition as he pleases of his property,
                            subject to his contract with the mosque. He cannot be touched for his
                            debts—it can be transmitted to his children, and it can be sold to
                            another. The mosque pays to the owner a small sum as parchase money on
                            the completion of the contract. It becomes the real owner only in case
                            of the death of the original proprietor without children. In this way,
                            however, a vast amount of property has fallen into the possession of the
                            mosques, an amount of which no strictly accurate estimate exists, but
                            which is said to surpass five hundred millions of dollars. This vast
                            wealth, which now serves but few useful purposes, the government intends
                            to appropriate to the general uses of the state—to road-making, to
                            internal improvements, to the extinction of the public debt, &amp;c.,
                            &amp;c. To accomplish so desirable a purpose, the removal of the late
                            Sheik-ul-Islam was a step of primary importance. We may soon look for an
                            imperial decree in relation to the Vakouf properties, which will have a
                            most important influence on the future fortunes of the empire.</p>
                        <p>The invitation of the Emperor Napoleon to the Sultan to unite in the
                            proposed congress of European sovereigns, which at first was favorably
                            regarded by the latter, seems recently to have excited his distrust. It
                            is said that this has to be attributed to the fact that within a few
                            days a despatch has been communicated to the Sultan showing that the
                            Emperor intends to bring the question of Syria and the Principalities
                            before the congress. As this may open the whole Turkish question, the
                            Sultan is apprehensive that the integrity of the empire may be assailed
                            in that body, and he has, therefore, become very reluctant to give his
                            unqualified adhesion.</p>

                        <p>Reliable advices received here represent that the Russian government is
                            actually engaged in putting its Black Sea ports and adjacent localities
                            in the best possible state of defence. Kertsch, on the straits leading
                            to the Sea of Azof, is being converted into a fortress of even greater
                            strength than Sevastapol. A force of 200,000 men is being massed along
                            the frontier, from the Black sea to the Baltic, and the Turkish frontier
                            is covered by such a large Russian force as already to have provoked a
                            call for explanation from the Turkish government. All the signs prove
                            that Russia is preparing for defensive war on a scale of the grandest
                            magnitude. The general opinion here is, that we are on the eve of a
                            great European war. This may be an unfounded apprehension; but the angry
                            tone of intercourse that exists between leading powers on the Polish and
                            Danish questions, and the difficulty of settling those questions
                            peaceably, seem to give countenance to these fears.</p>
                        <p>The result of the recent elections in the United States has removed all
                            doubts of the determination of the people of the free States to
                            prosecute the war to the successful re-establishment of the Union. The
                            splendid vindication they have given to the wise, humane and energetic
                            action of the President and his cabinet affords one. peculiar
                            gratification to notice.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to communicate the
                            following information concerning the present condition of the Turkish
                            navy. The particulars are derived from reliable authority.</p>
                        <p>In construction: At the Constantinople navy yard, 1 screw
                            ship-of-the-line; 2 screw frigates; 2 paddle-wheel frigates; 1 screw
                            corvette; 2 screw gunboats or yachts. At other Turkish navy yards, 3
                            frigates, 2 corvettes, and other smaller vessels. In England, 3
                            steel-clad frigates are ordered, and 1 in France; but a considerable
                            period of time will elapse before they are finished. Ten gun-boats are
                            also in construction. The Sultan has ordered 10 steamers, of 350
                            horse-power each, to be constructed out of his private purse in England.
                            These are chiefly intended for the personal service of the court.</p>
                        <p>Of vessels ready for service, there are 1 ship-of-the-line of 130 cannon;
                            1 of 90; 5 steam frigates of 90 cannon each, (2 not yet fitted up with
                            machinery;) 2 steam screw vessels of 60 cannon; 2 ditto of 48 cannon,
                            these latter not yot fitted with machinery; 1 sailing frigate of 52
                            cannon; 4 paddle-wheel frigates of 16 cannon each; 6 screw corvettes of
                            6 cannon; 30 goelettes and cutters of 190 cannon in all; about 40
                            transport steamers, of which about one quarter are out of service
                            repairing; 4 sailing transports and yachts; also 10 small steamers on
                            station in Turkish ports.</p>
                        <p>Besides the sailors, there is a force of 3,000 marines.</p>
                        <p>There is one naval school, and that at Khalki, of the Prince’s islands.
                            No practical instruction is given to the pupils by experimental
                            cruisers. About 200 pupils are in attendance.</p>
                        <p>The machinery for the navy is all constructed in England or France, and
                            the engineers are generally Englishmen.</p>
                        <p>None of the more recent improvements in gunnery have been adopted, and
                            but little care is taken to exercise the sailors in nautical manœuvres,
                            and the <pb facs="0401" n="377" xml:id="pg_377"/> fleet cannot,
                            consequently, be considered as in a high state of efficiency. There is
                            not a single rifled cannon on board any vessel in the navy.</p>
                        <p>With such a small and inefficient navy, as yet altogether composed of
                            wooden vessels, there is reason to fear that in a war with Russia the
                            Turkish naval power would be seriously crippled, if not altogether
                            destroyed. It cannot be safely relied on as one of the trustworthy
                            defences of the empire.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>* * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Among the most useful of the latest reforms projected by the Porte is the
                            creation at Constantinople of a tribunal of arbitration for the
                            equitable settlement of all commercial disputes between the Porte and
                            foreigners, and between Turkish subjects and foreigners resident in the
                            Ottoman empire. This court, which is soon to be called into existence,
                            will consist of three members, an English, French, and German lawyer,
                            each with salaries of $6000 per annum, to be paid by the Porte. Such a
                            tribunal, conducted with integrity and impartiality, will facilitate the
                            settlement of many vexatious and important questions, which otherwise
                            would be exposed to the long delays incident to diplomatic negotiation.
                            The Turkish tribunals are all stained with the vice of venality, and
                            their corruption is so notorious that recourse to them is avoided as
                            much as possible. I regret to say that the lust of money, and the
                            corrupting tendencies associated with it, overspread the whole surface
                            of Turkish administration, corrupting every branch of it to such a
                            degree as to stifle both the sense of honor and duty and the instincts
                            of patriotism. The Greek empire, in the last stages of its decline, has
                            had no parallel in corruption which approached it so closely as the
                            Turkish government at the present time. Such wide spread political
                            profligacy is a surer indication of approaching dissolution than any
                            other evidence of weakness in the Turkish empire.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish government is, at present, in great distress for want of
                            money. The income is not sufficient to meet the annual outlay, and hence
                            the necessity of foreign loans. The troops have not been paid for
                            several months in the capital, and in the provinces the arrears cover a
                            much longer period of time. The civil employés in the capital have also
                            not been paid for the last three months. It has lately attempted,
                            without success, to obtain a loan of two millions of dollars from the
                            New Ottoman Bank. A scheme for a forced loan is now being devised. The
                            amount of the actual debt of the empire is distributed as follows:</p>

                            dollar.</p>
                        <p>The hostile attitude of the Danubian Principalities, almost openly
                            menacing war against the Suzerain power of the Porte, and the
                            apprehension of a general <pb facs="0402" n="378" xml:id="pg_378"/>
                            European war, involve the necessity of new expenditures and an increase
                            of debt. The army, which now amounts to 200,000 men, is being increased
                            by calling a large proportion of the reserve force under arms. The Greek
                            frontier is being covered with a line of defensive works, and the coasts
                            of Albania and Epirus, adjacent to the Ionian islands, are also to be
                            provided with formidable military works. The cession of the Ionian
                            islands, always regarded with a hostile eye by the Porte, as seriously
                            menacing the security of the western frontier of the empire, imposes the
                            necessity of great vigilance and efficient measures of defence in that
                            quarter. New fortifications, under the superintendence of distinguished
                            engineers, are in course of construction along the Dardanelles, and
                            every effort is making, in view of a rupture of the existing peace, to
                            defend the approaches to the. capital and the Danubian, Adriatic, and
                            Russian frontiers. The crippled state of the finances will render a
                            defensive war of long duration next to impossible on the part of the
                            Porte without the aid of large foreign loans.</p>
                        <p>I have deemed it my duty to persevere in the effort to secure the arrest
                            of the assassin Kaleel, and for this purpose have requested new
                            instructions from the Porte to the governor of Adana on the subject. The
                            copy of these instructions, which I have the honor to enclose, will show
                            the royal co-operation which I receive from the Porte in the effort to
                            bring this criminal to justice. His late protector, the Caimacam of
                            Payas, Mustook Pasha, has been deposed from office, a fact which will
                            have a most salutary influence in deterring other provincial
                            functionaries from covering the perpetrators of crime with the shield of
                            official authority.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency:</hi>The American legation represents
                                that though a letter dated the 6th of Sefer, 1279, and another
                                strengthening it of Ramazan 10, 1279), A. H., on the subject of the
                                arrest of the individual named Kaleel, said to be one of the
                                assassins of the American citizen, Mr. Coffing, killed near
                                Escanderoon, were sent to those parts with orders to use every
                                possible means for his seizure and a thorough investigation in
                                evidence of the facts for the purpose of reporting them here, it now
                                states that the said Kaleel has not been arrested, and is fearlessly
                                continuing at liberty, the consequence of the indifference of the
                                executive authorities of the place to the performance of their duty;
                                and also that, in case attention be given to the matter, he may now
                                be readily arrested.</p>
                            <p>The legation asks that orders be sent your excellency to this effect,
                                strengthening and confirming the preceding ones.</p>
                            <p>The present order is, therefore, now sent to your excellency to
                                direct that the most complete execution of the preceding ones be
                                effected; and, in case of need, that a communication be opened by
                                your excellency with all the neighboring authorities of those parts,
                                so that every possible means be used to secure the arrest of said
                                Kaleel and the interrogation of other parties, and to report the
                                result here in a Mazbattah.</p>

                        <p>I am pleased to know that the pistols manufactured as a present to his
                            Highness Kibrisili Pacha, governor of Adrianople, in recognition of his
                            services in the arrest and punishment of the assassins of Rev. Mr.
                            Merriam, have been already forwarded from the United States. When they
                            arrive, it will give me great pleasure, in delivering them to his
                            Highness, to execute the very judicious instructions contained in your
                            despatch of January 11, 1864.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish government has been temporarily relieved of its financial
                            embarrassments by the negotiation of a loan with the Imperial Bank to
                            the amount of $2,500,000, giving as security the balance still remaining
                            unpaid of the last European loan, the government to reimburse the
                            principal in four years at 120,000 Turkish liras per annum. This sum is
                            hardly sufficient to cover the arrears to the civil employés and to the
                            army and navy. In case of war the government would be seriously
                            embarrassed for want of funds, as the greater part of the several loans
                            contracted are consumed in meeting current and past liabilities.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of the Danubian Principalities is exceedingly hostile to the
                            Porte, and advantage will be taken of the first favorable moment to
                            assert complete independence of the Porte. It is generally understood
                            that a treaty offensive and defensive in regard to the Porte exists
                            between Servia and Moldavia and Wallachia. The united military force of
                            these two Principalities is estimated at 75,000 men, well equipped and
                            armed.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>I received by the steamer Venitian of last week the case of revolvers
                            intended by the President of the United States as a present to his
                            Highness Kibrisili Pacha, governor of Adrianople, in acknowledgment of
                            his services in securing the punishment of the assassins of Rev. Mr.
                            Merriam.</p>
                        <p>This most elegant gift, admirable alike for beauty of ornament and
                            artistical finish, will be a source of great gratification to his
                            Highness. They have this day been forwarded to him through Mr. Blunt,
                            the English consul at Adrianople. I have requested him to present them
                            in person to the Pacha, with an accompanying letter from me, as he was
                            so honorably and intimately associated with him in his efforts to secure
                            the ends of justice in this case.</p>
                        <p>The Porte has recently addressed to the different legations a note, in
                            which it announces its intention to take under its exclusive charge the
                            maritime postal <pb facs="0404" n="380" xml:id="pg_380"/> service on the
                            coasts of the empire, as it has done with the postal service of the
                            interior. At present the coast mails are carried by French, Russian,
                            Austrian, and Greek steamers, and distributed through their respective
                            post offices. The land service is as well performed as it can be, where
                            the roads are as insecure as they are in this country. I have replied to
                            the above note in approbatory terms. A copy of my reply is enclosed.</p>
                        <p>Mustook Pacha, the protector of the assassin Kaleel, whom I caused to be
                            removed from the Caimacamship of the district of Payas, where he has
                            been the terror of the surrounding country for the last fifteen years,
                            has been degraded from office. Beyazia Oglon Akmet Pacha, a man of
                            entirely a different type of character, has been appointed his
                            successor. Since the arrest of Mustook Pacha, his son, Dede Bey, has
                            been engaged in acts of brigandage on the road between Alexandretta
                            (Iskenderoon) and Adana, to such an extent that it has been found
                            necessary to send a force of six hundred men against him. With his
                            apprehension it is to be hoped that security may again be restored to
                            that part of the country.</p>
                        <p>The insecurity of the roads has again received a striking illustration in
                            the robbery of the Turkish land post, eight hours ‘distant only from the
                            capital, on the route to Adrianople. Several of the guards were killed
                            by volleys from an ambushed band of Greeks, who had landed in boats on
                            the adjacent coast, and 3,000,000 of piastres were carried off. This
                            occurred on Saturday last.</p>
                        <p>The government military school has recently been reorganized on a new
                            basis, and transferred to a large edifice on the heights of Pera. This
                            school is designed to prepare officers for the etat major and for the
                            land forces. The course of study is five years for the former and four
                            for the latter. The programme of studies embraces calligraphy, drawing,
                            arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, chemistry, physics, mechanics,
                            topography, the military sciences, engineering, fortifications, &amp;c.,
                            history, the Persian, Arabic, and French languages, composition and
                            syntax. There is also a preparatory school, in which instruction is
                            given in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, Persian and Arabic.
                            At the last examination a few weeks since, which was held in presence of
                            the Sultan, sixty pupils graduated with the rank of officers.</p>
                        <p>Among the notable features of the day of examination was the admission of
                            thirty-five Christian students, taken from the Armenian, Catholic,
                            Greek, and Bulgarian communities. On receiving these young pupils, the
                            Sultan addressed them in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>“It has been my constant desire to establish a perfect equality among all
                            classes of my subjects. I am happy on every occasion that presents
                            itself to give practical effect to this principle, the application of
                            which, according to the wants and capacities of the different
                            populations of the empire, is destined to complete the scheme of its
                            regeneration.”</p>
                        <p>On the part of the Christian pupils the following address was presented
                            to the Sultan by one of their number:</p>
                        <p>“The Christian communities, subjects of the empire, in receiving to-day
                            this new proof of the jealous solicitude of your Imperial Majesty,
                            cannot refrain from expressing their gratitude for the same. In placing
                            ourselves from this moment under the powerful protection of your
                            Majesty, we promise to devote ourselves assiduously to our studies, so
                            as to render ourselves worthy to serve under the banners of such an
                            illustrious prince. May a gracious Providence bless the reign of your
                            Majesty, and preserve your life for many years for the benefit of your
                            subjects.”</p>
                        <p>I deem it my duty to take note of such movements as the above, indicative
                            as they are of the growing spirit of tolerance of the Turkish government
                            to its Christian subjects, and of its efforts to give them, with the
                            mussulman population, a common interest in the preservation of the

                            note you were pleased to write me on the 4th instant, on the subject of
                            the measures adopted by the Ottoman government for the organization of
                            maritime posts, and thus to effect the conveyance of letters on the
                            coast in the same manner as has already been done, with so many
                            advantages, in the interior of the empire.</p>
                        <p>These measures cannot be otherwise than productive of very great
                            benefits, both to the Ottoman and foreign populations, and to the
                            commercial interests of all classes. The numerous foreign posts existing
                            in the empire, each under different directors, are the source of
                            inconveniences which prevent the free exchange of communications by sea,
                            and the amount of postage, often uncertain and excessive, creates
                            irregularities which call for a thorough reform. Their adoption also
                            shows that the Ottoman government, as an enlightened and progressive
                            nation, is determined to exercise its own evident rights; and that of
                            the United States will observe with pleasure that his Imperial Majesty
                            is not indifferent to the exercise by others of functions which belong
                            to his state only, and should be for its own account, as well as under
                            its own immediate control.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of the present opportunity to renew to your highness
                            assurances of my perfect consideration.</p>

                            from his Highness Mehemed Kibrisili Pacha, in relation to the gift with
                            which he has been honored by the President of the United States. Should

                            gift will be found to have made a lasting impression on his mind, and
                            will confirm him in the friendly feeling which he has ever manifested

                        <p>The zealous care which the President has taken to manifest his

                            jeopardy. This act of liberality shows with what keen watchfulness the
                            present administration regards the conduct of <pb facs="0406" n="382"

                            security of American life is in question. It throws new guards around
                            American life in this semi-barbarous country, and does it honor in the
                            estimation of all who judge of the character of government by the vigor,
                            zeal, and energy it displays in the protection of its citizens in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The struggle for the preservation of
                            independence in Circassia has at length ceased. The last tribe which
                            held out was obliged to succumb to famine, having, for the last seven
                            months, lived on boiled poplar leaves. The country is now overrun in all
                            directions by the Russians, and Circassia has ceased to exist, except as
                            a province of the Russian empire.</p>
                        <p>Almost the entire population of Circassia is emigrating to Turkey. With
                            that hospitality which has always distinguished the Turkish government,
                            the most generous provision has been made for the reception of this
                            brave but unfortunate people. Three ports have been designated at which
                            they are to be landed, and twelve of the largest government steamers are
                            to be despatched to the Circassian coasts to receive the emigrants as
                            they are ready for embarcation. They will be fed and clothed at the
                            expense of the Turkish government. This will occasion a large
                            expenditure, but it is cheerfully borne, as hospitality is a religious
                            virtue among mussulmen, enjoined by the Koran, and scrupulously
                            practiced in all ages.</p>
                        <p>During the last two years there has been a steady tide of emigration to
                            Turkey from Circassia, and from among the Tartars of the Crimea. At
                            least 60,000 Circassians and Crimean Tartars have emigrated to Turkey
                            since the war in the Crimea. As they came into the empire in a destitute
                            state, the Porte is obliged to maintain them until they are able to
                            provide for themselves. This it has not only done, but it has also
                            established a commission charged with the <pb facs="0407" n="383"
                                xml:id="pg_383"/> duty of locating them on government land, which is
                            bestowed upon them as a free gift under certain conditions. They are
                            provided with agricultural instruments and instructed in the proper
                            cultivation of the land; they have for the most part, thus far, been
                            located in that great alluvial plain, called the Dobrudscha, and which
                            lies between the lower Danube and the Black Sea, and where the
                            population is very scant. The Circassians gradually adapt themselves to
                            fixed habits of life and become good farmers. As they appear in the
                            streets of Constantinople, their tall, lithe, straight forms, fresh
                            complexions, almost untinged by the sun, and their mobile and expressive
                            features, never fail to arrest the attention of the stranger. Their
                            physiognomy is altogether European, and it would not be possible in
                            European capitals to detect them as Circassians, so close is their
                            resemblance to the Anglo-Saxon and Latin races, and rather to the former
                            than the latter. Their religion is Mohammedan. The conquest of Circassia
                            is an important political event. It gives Russia the possession of the
                            whole line of the Black Sea coast from the Crimea to the Turkish
                            frontier, of all the country lying between the Caspian and Black seas,
                            and will facilitate the progress of her conquering march across Persia
                            to India.</p>
                        <p>The above facts, so honorable to the Turkish government, I have deemed
                            worthy of special mention. They are a part of the history of the times,

                        <p>I have the honor to enclose, from the official paper of the government,
                            the annual report of the Grand Vizier to the Sultan on the action of
                            various departments of the Turkish government during the last year. It
                            exhibits a gratifying picture of progress, and of skilful administration
                            of the finances. The expenditures have been reduced below the estimates;
                            roads have been opened an various points in the interior of the empire;
                            improvements have been made it the system of public instruction; and
                            important reforms have been adopted in the government of the provinces,
                            and in the administration of justice. Mention is made of that most
                            extraordinary event, the emigration of the Circassians. From this report
                            it appears that within the last nine years about 600,000 of these
                            unfortunate people have fled for refuge to Turkey, where they have met
                            with a hospitable reception from the government of the Sultan. Of this
                            number, 283,000 have emigrated to Turkey since the final subjugation of
                            their country by the Russians during the present year.</p>

                        <p>In order to obviate the abuses of government in the provinces, the Porte
                            is about dividing Asiatic Turkey into three great provinces, of the
                            first of which, embracing the present provinces of Damascus, Saida, and
                            Jerusalem, Damascus will be the capital. Of the second, embracing the
                            present provinces of Aleppo Erfas, Adana and Marash, Aleppo will be the
                            capital. The third government will include the pachalicks of Kurdistan
                            and Erzeroum, with the city of Erzeroum as capital</p>
                        <p>The evils of decentralization will by this system be lessened, and a
                            closer responsibility to the central government be created. A large
                            increase of power over that enjoyed by the present provincial governors
                            will be granted to their successors under the new system, that they may
                            be able to reflect the policy and views of the Porte with greater vigor;
                            but they will be held to a more strict responsibility for their acts and
                            the condition of their respective governments. It is expected that this
                            administrative reconstruction, and the changes and reforms connected
                            with it, will have a tendency to improve the government of Asiatic
                            Turkey, a part of the empire which has suffered more than any other from
                            the corruption and malpractices of its rulers, and whose evil
                            administration has been such a fruitful source of crime and
                            disorder.</p>
                        <p>Another very important reform is also about to take place. The judges,
                            who have heretofore been appointed for a year, are to hold their offices
                            during good behavior. At present the judges are paid exclusively out of
                            the expenses of the <pb facs="0409" n="385" xml:id="pg_385"/> suits
                            instituted before them, and from this source they compensate their
                            employés. In all cases it is the plaintiff who pays the judicial
                            expenses of the suit. As these judges are supported by fees alone, it
                            is, of course, their interest to increase the amount of the same as much
                            as possible. Such a system of itself explains the origin of the
                            extortion and corruption incident to all Turkish tribunals. Hereafter
                            the judges are to be paid out of the state funds, which will certainly
                            cheapen justice and. remove the. temptations to existing corrupt
                            practices.</p>
                        <p>The flattering prospects recently held out with reference to the finances
                            of the empire cannot be realized. A deficiency of more than 120,000,000
                            piastres has been discovered, of which the enemies of the present grand
                            vizier are taking advantage to drive him from office. It is proposed,
                            however, to equalize the receipts and expenditures in the published
                            budget by certain economies in the different bureaus of administration.
                            The government has been obliged to negotiate a new loan of 2,200,000
                            Turkish liras at eight per cent. per annum. A part of this loan is to be
                            disposed of by the holders of it through a lottery, a system greatly in
                            vogue in Europe and Germany, especially for raising money for state
                            purposes.</p>

                            their present treaty stipulations with the United States as to concede
                            and guaranty general and equal rights and protection to all citizens of
                            the United States, without distinction of religious creed, travelling,
                            sojourning, or doing business in Switzerland. The additional article,
                            however, which has been proposed by Mr. Dubs, the president of the
                            confederation, stipulating that “the United States will accord to Swiss
                            citizens sojourning in those countries of America where Switzerland may
                            have no representative the same protection upon demand, by the consuls
                            of the United States, as is accorded to their own citizens,” is not
                            deemed admissable. You may state to Mr. Dubs that the United States will
                            cheerfully lend their good offices towards securing protection for Swiss
                            citizens under the circumstances referred to, but that the assumption of
                            such an obligation as he proposes would be a departure from the line of
                            proceeding hitherto pursued by this government in its conventional
                            arrangements with foreign powers which it would not feel justified in
                            making.</p>

                            city Mr. John Hitz, has transmitted to this department, by request of
                            the federal chancellor of his government, a communication inviting the
                            United States to participate in the proceedings of a congress which is
                            to assemble at Geneva, on the 8th of next month, for the purpose of
                            taking into consideration the means for the better care of wounded men
                            in time of war. Mr. Hitz has been informed that the answer to this
                            invitation would be communicated to you. The object of the proposed
                            congress is certainly laudable and important, and the department sees no
                            objection to your being present on the occasion. You are therefore
                            authorized to attend the meeting in an informal manner, for the purpose
                            of giving or receiving such suggestions as you may think likely to
                            promote the humane ends which have prompted it.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to add that your presence at the congress would be
                            improper if any of the insurgent emissaries of the United States in
                            Europe should be permitted to take part in its proceedings.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Your despatch of July 13, No. 64, has been
                            received, and has been considered with all the attention due to the
                            subject of which it treats, and with that profound respect and good will
                            which the United States habitually entertain for the republic of
                            Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>I have no hesitation in approving and confirming all that you have
                            written to the federal council upon the case of John Zweifel. That
                            person emigrated to this country and became naturalized here. As a
                            citizen of the United States he had free choice to remain here and enjoy
                            the full benefits of his change of allegiance, or to return to
                            Switzerland, escaping such responsibilities, and foregoing such present
                            benefits of American citizenship as are dependent on domicile in the
                            United States. By the constitution and laws of Switzerland and by treaty
                            he was entitled to visit and indefinitely remain in that country. The
                            United States by force of any law or treaty cannot impose upon him in
                            Switzerland the performance of any of the duties of a citizen, nor even
                            require that he shall be obliged to leave that country and return to the
                            United States. No law of nations, no treaty, no law of the United
                            States, nor even any municipal law of any State or city, entitles a
                            citizen, whether native or natural zed, who voluntarily abandons this
                            country and seeks asylum in a foreign land, to be supported there or to
                            be recalled here to receive support or even protection from this
                            government. No law of nations, no treaty, no law of the United States,
                            no municipal law of any State or city makes any provision either for
                            supporting such paupers in voluntary exile or for bringing them here as
                            objects of public charity. No law or treaty of any kind binds the United
                            States to Switzerland or to any other country, to relieve it from the
                            care of the poor of whatever class, who by treaties or emigration has
                            fallen under its care. Nor is the principle which is deduced from these
                            premises a harsh, or ungenerous, or inhuman one. The United States
                            receive a thousand emigrants from every European country in exchange for
                            each individual American citizen who seeks a foreign domicile. Among
                            such emigrants who are annually reckoned now even by hundreds of
                            thousands many come who either flee from poverty or disease at home, or
                            are overtaken by such affliction on their way hither and succumb to them
                            after arriving here. All such are at once placed upon the broad
                            foundations of our public charities, and the question is not even asked
                            whence they came, nor even the question whether they have become
                            naturalized, or in any way domiciled in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The United States will in good faith fulfil their treaty with
                            Switzerland. All of their citizens who shall be sent hither by the
                            government of that republic in conformity with the treaty will be
                            cheerfully received at all times and under all circumstances, they,
                            their wives and their children. But this government must decline to go
                            further and become almoners in foreign countries, or bring back at the
                            public expense recreant or inconstant citizens who fall into misfortune
                            abroad.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of the 2d of July, No. 62,
                            has been received. The explanations which you gave to the President of
                            our reasons for declining to make a <pb facs="0412" n="388"
                                xml:id="pg_388"/> formal stipulation that our consuls in American
                            States should extend their functions so as to afford protection to
                            citizens of Switzerland were so judicious, that I should not have been
                            dissatisfied if you had placed the responsibility for them on this
                            department. We shall in no proper case decline to give special authority
                            to a consul, or even a diplomatic agent, to render any service to the
                            government of Switzerland that shall be compatible with our obligations
                            to foreign States, under the law of nations. It would, however, be quite
                            a different thing to enter just now into a formal arrangement pledging
                            ourselves to the general exercise of such a comity. Nations not friendly
                            to the United States, although at peace with them, might seize such a
                            circumstance and turn it into a precedent for similar assumptions, which
                            we might find it necessary to disallow. It must be remembered that the
                            European maritime powers appear to have lifted up the insurgents of our
                            country to the condition of lawful belligerents. Most of the lesser
                            states range themselves with these maritime powers in this new and
                            injurious attitude towards the United States. Under these circumstances,
                            many consuls whose functions, legitimately exercised, would tend to the
                            promotion of legitimate foreign commerce, are now practically employed
                            as agents in furthering illegitimate and contraband trade with our
                            domestic enemies. It would be very unwise on our part to do anything
                            which might even indirectly result in increasing. these
                            embarrassments.</p>

                            of the 9th ultimo, relative to the proposed exchange of arms between
                            Switzerland and the United States, a letter upon the subject was
                            addressed to the Secretary of War, to which a reply has just been
                            received, of which I herewith enclose a transcript. You will learn from
                            this that the arms and accoutrements for the Swiss government are now
                            nearly ready for transportation.</p>

                            “confidential,” of the date of September 14, and enclosing a copy of a
                            despatch dated September 11, to Mr. Motley, United States minister at
                            Vienna, is received.</p>
                        <p>Having, carefully read your despatch to Mr. Motley, permit me to say that
                            the suggestions therein contained, and which seem to be intended as
                            directions for all the United States diplomatic agents abroad, commend
                            themselves to. my judgment as eminently timely and wise. I cannot doubt
                            that our government looks with intense interest upon the proceedings of
                            the French government in Mexico. There can, for a long time, have been
                            no doubt, in the minds of intelligent observers of the events there
                            transpiring, that the Emperor of France is <hi rend="italic">now</hi>,
                            at least, if not at the commencement of his invasion, bent on
                            supplanting a republican form of government by an imperial one, and that
                            without <hi rend="italic">really</hi> consulting the Mexican people.</p>
                        <p>That these proceedings will, at some not very distant day, demand and
                            receive the attention of the people and government of the United States,
                            I firmly believe. That no recognition of, or consent to, those
                            proceedings will ever be extorted from our indifference or weakness I as
                            firmly hope. Having, as that expedition against Mexico did have, its
                            origin in a scheme against the peace and integrity of the United States,
                            it is due, not less imperatively to a sister and neighbor republic than
                            to the dignity and character of our own government, that the invaders
                            receive no aid or countenance at our hands. Begun in conspiracy, and
                            prosecuted under false pretenses, I trust to see no concessions or
                            recognitions on the part of our authorities interposing to save this
                            Mexican enterprise from the disaster and disgrace it so richly
                            merits.</p>
                        <p>But it is not necessary that we do more at presesent than maintain a
                            “masterly inactivity” in view of events transpiring in Mexico. It may
                            not be advisable that we <hi rend="italic">protest</hi> even, except by
                            our silence. Our nation has work of its own which cannot wait. Its <hi
                                rend="italic">present</hi> duty is to save itself. Its <hi
                                rend="italic">future</hi> may be to save its neighbor, and vindicate
                            the supremacy of republican institutions upon the American continent. I
                            trust in Heaven it will. But for that future we can afford to wait,
                            while we cannot now afford to throw down the gauntlet to any new
                            foe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that the
                            biennial elections for the renewal of the national councils have just
                            been held in all the cantons throughout the Swiss confederation. I have
                            the pleasure to add, also, that they have taken place without any undue
                            excitement, and in a manner everywhere highly creditable to the whole
                            people of Switzerland and to the liberal republican institutions under
                            which they live.</p>
                        <p>This election derives its national importance from the fact that upon the
                            body just elected, in addition to being the popular law-making branch of
                            its government, devolves the duty of designating the executive of the
                            confederation, the members of the federal council for the ensuing three
                            years, commencing with the first of January next.</p>
                        <p>In a very few districts the people failed to make a choice and subsequent
                            elections will be held. But they will in no respect vary the general
                            result already ascertained, which is regarded as a popular indorsement
                            of the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> and <hi rend="italic">measures</hi> of
                            the present liberal administration.</p>
                        <p>One important change, however, in the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of
                            the present federal council will take place, by the voluntary retirement
                            of Mr. Staempfli, who was last year, and has been during several
                            previous years, president of the confederation. Mr. Staempfli retires to
                            accept the direction-in-chief of an extensive banking institution just
                            established at Berne. The reasons he assigns for withdrawing from the
                            government is the duty of providing for the wants of a growing family, a
                            duty which the small salary accorded to the members of the federal
                            council and to the president of the confederation would not enable him
                            to fulfil.</p>
                        <p>This step of Mr. Staempfli, though not working any present change in the
                            policy or spirit of the government of the confederation, is deemed to be
                            not without its importance, from the fact that he has been, for a series
                            of years—indeed, ever since the adoption of the federal constitution—<hi

                        <p>The Swiss national assembly has just adjourned, after a busy, but
                            generally harmonious, session of three weeks. As was expected, all the
                            members of the federal council, with the exception of Mr. Staempfli, who
                            is replaced by Mr. Schenk, of Berne, were re-elected for the ensuing

                        <p>Subsequently, from this federal council of seven, the two houses, in

                            president of the confederation, and Hon. Carl Schenk, of the canton of
                            Berne, vice-president for the year 1864. Mr. Dubs, who is the present
                            vice-president, is a gentleman <pb facs="0415" n="391" xml:id="pg_391"/>

                            not be without interest to the President, as well as to yourself, to be
                            informed that the late national assembly before its adjournment passed
                            resolutions, with almost absolute unanimity, in strong disapproval of
                            the system of human slavery, and that with direct and special reference
                            to the attempt now making in America to lay the corner stone of a new

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Yesterday being the day fixed by the Swiss
                            constitution for the inauguration of the new president of the
                            confederation, all the heads of the legation made it, as is customary,
                            the occasion of calling upon the president, at the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Palais Federal,</hi> to felicitate him upon his accession, and to
                            exchange the salutations of the new year.</p>
                        <p>In my interview the president took occasion to speak of the profound
                            interest with which not only himself but all the members of the Swiss
                            government had watched the great struggle in the United States. There
                            was, he said, but one sentiment, in truth, among the whole Swiss people,
                            that was a sentiment of repugnance to the rebellion and of earnest
                            sympathy with the efforts of the government to maintain the Union. He
                            added that it gave him great satisfaction to congratulate me on the
                            military successes which had lately attended the armies of the
                            Union—successes which rendered it, in his judgment, more than probable,
                            that the year just commenced would witness the re-establishment of the
                            authority of the federal government over all their territory.</p>
                        <p>Every Swiss, he said, looked with aversion upon the institution of
                            slavery, which they could not but regard as utterly irreconcilable with
                            any just pretensions to republicanism. The system as it had existed in
                            the United States had justly been our great national reproach, which no
                            European republican could defend, and in view of which the most despotic
                            princes could point at us the finger of scorn. The system was not only a
                            disgrace and a curse to America, but it was, as a product of almost
                            exclusively republican growth, a stumbling block in the path of liberal
                            ideas and popular institutions all over the world. Great and appalling
                            as were the sacrifices of the present war, the overthrow of that system
                            would repay them all, and make of our contest a holy war for the rights
                            of man in all lands.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, he spoke of the high appreciation with which the public
                            sentiment and conscience of all Europe was gradually coming to regard
                            the character and person of the President: of. the United States, whose
                            name, he predicted, would one day, and that not far hence, be enrolled
                            among those rulers who have done most for the advancement of human
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>Above I do not pretend to give the president’s words with <hi
                                rend="italic">verbal</hi> exactness. Indeed I could not, as the
                            conversation was in French. But I give the substance with entire
                            accuracy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatches of January 29 and February
                            4, Nos. 48 and 49, are received. I communicated to the president of the
                            confederation so much of your despatch as relates to the death of Mr.
                            Hitz, and the high estimation in which he was held by yourself, the
                            President, and all who were in the way of holding official relations
                            with him. The president said his death was greatly regretted by the
                            Swiss government and people, and wished me to thank you for the kind
                            manner in which you had borne testimony to his loyalty to his own
                            country, and to his just and honorable bearings toward the great sister
                            republic to which he was so long accredited.</p>
                        <p>The president then referred to the subject of appointing a successor to
                            Mr. Hitz, on which no action had yet been taken. There was, he said, a
                            very general desire, especially among the Swiss in America, for the
                            appointment of a minister to Washington. But such a step would
                            necessitate the appointment of ministers also at London, St. Petersburg,
                            Vienna and Berlin, and would thus entail a great additional charge upon
                            the treasury, which the Swiss people could not now well bear; the
                            government having at the present moment certain great public works on
                            its hands, which demanded all the financial resources of the
                            confederation.</p>
                        <p>The president wished me to reiterate to you his anxious desire for the
                            early suppression of the rebellion and the restoration of our Union to
                            more than its ancient power and prosperity.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the satisfaction of informing you
                            that, at length, the Swiss government have given me assurance of their
                            readiness to so far modify their present treaty stipulations with the
                            United States as to concede and guarantee general and <hi rend="italic"
                                >equal rights</hi> and protection to all citizens of the United
                            States, without distinction of religious creed, travelling, sojourning,
                            or doing business in Switzerland. This, you are aware, they have
                            heretofore held themselves not bound to, by reason of the proviso
                            contained in the first article of the treaty negotiated by Mr. Dudley
                            Mann, which proviso subordinates the general scope of the treaty to “the
                            constitutional or legal provisions, as well <hi rend="italic"
                                >federal</hi> as <hi rend="italic">state</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                        <pb facs="0417" n="393" xml:id="pg_393"/>
                        <p>Under this sweeping reservation, inserted, doubtless, with special
                            reference to South Carolina’s theory of State sovereignty, and no rights
                            to free negroes, a few of the small Swiss cantons have refused to
                            recognize the application of the treaty to such American citizens as did
                            not profess the Christian religion, and especially to such as adhere to
                            the Israelitish faith. The consequences have been reclamations and
                            complaints preferred to the legation here, and by the legation
                            communicated to the federal council. To all of which the federal
                            council, while regretting the illiberal legislation of those cantons,
                            feel obliged to point to the proviso in the treaty, and to content
                            themselves, after the manner of the successor of Saint Peter, with a <hi

                        <p>In a conversation, however, held to-day with the president of the
                            confederation, Mr. Dubs, he informed me that the federal council are now
                            disposed to so amend the existing treaty that no discrimination founded
                            on religious belief shall hereafter be made or endured by citizens of
                            the United States within the limits of the Swiss confederation.</p>
                        <p>He desired me also to propose to you the addition of a second article of
                            the general purport following:</p>
                        <p>“The United States accord to Swiss citizens sojourning in those countries
                            of <hi rend="italic">America</hi> where Switzerland may have no
                            representative, the same protection, upon demand by the consuls of the
                            United States, as is accorded to their own citizens.”</p>
                        <p>Upon the admissibility of the above article, or its equivalent, as a
                            treaty stipulation, I confess to some doubts, but I have not considered
                            it carefully enough to have formd an opinion; in some way, I make no
                            doubt, the object sought to be secured by the proposition of the
                            president of the confederation can be reached.</p>
                        <p>I assured the president that he could rely upon the desire of the
                            President of the United States and yourself to do everything within your
                            rightful authority to strengthen the relations of sympathy and
                            friendship so long and happily subsisting between two sister
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>Submitting the proposition to your consideration, and awaiting your
                            instructions, I am, very respectfully and sincerely, your obedient

                            the proposition for a treaty stipulation engaging United States consuls

                            the Swiss Confederation may have no official representative.</p>
                        <p>I learn that, by treaty engagements made long since, <hi rend="italic"
                                >French</hi> consuls have been accustomed to afford the same kind of
                            protection, on application, to Swiss citizens in the east which they ask
                            of the United States consuls in the west. The <hi rend="italic"

                                rend="italic">to</hi> my despatches Nos. 58 and 59, dated April 16
                            and 29, communicating the proposition of the federal council for an
                            amendment of the existing treaty between Switzerland and the United
                            States, I beg to recall your attention to the subject.</p>
                        <p>In this connexion it has occured to me that possibly the treaty might be
                            modified with advantage to the citizens of both countries in some other
                            of its provisions. For instance, article 2 provides that while “the
                            citizens of one of the two countries residing in the other shall be free
                            from personal military service, they shall be liable to the pecuniary of
                            material contributions which may be required, by way of compensation,
                            from citizens of the country where they reside, who are exempt from the
                            said service.” The practical operation of this provision is believed to
                            inure exclusively to the Swiss, inasmuch as Americans residing here are
                            required to pay a <hi rend="italic">military tax,</hi> while I apprehend
                            no such tax is ever levied on Swiss in the United States.</p>
                        <p>There may be some other provisions which ought to be modified, and which
                            may occur to the State Department in looking over the existing
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>But possibly you do not deem any modification necessary for the present,
                            and decline the proposition of the president of the confederation which
                            I communicated in my former despatch. If so, I would like to be informed
                            to that effect, and be enabled to communicate the response of the State
                            Department to the federal council.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Your despatch No. 52, of the 31st May, was
                            received some days since. The day after its receipt I waited upon the
                            president, with a carefully prepared translation in the French of the
                            same. Having read the despatch, the president expressed some
                            disappointment at the inability of the United States government to
                            accede to the proposition of the federal council in relation to American
                            consuls (in America) affording protection to Swiss citizens.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that, as you had stated, it would be a departure from the
                            policy hitherto followed by our government, and that <hi rend="italic"
                                >now</hi> was especially a most inopportune moment to adopt a new
                            policy, which might be construed as a departure from that course of
                            “non-intervention” which we were persistently demanding that other
                            powers should maintain towards ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I suggested, further, that the delicacy of our present relations with.
                            France, in part growing out of recent and current transactions in
                            Mexico, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be an additional reason why the
                            United States must hesitate before any step that could possibly produce
                            new complications, at a time when all the national energies were tasked
                            to guard and vindicate the national life.</p>
                        <p>Of course I was careful to say that these suggestions were my own, and
                            not those of the President or of the State Department.</p>
                        <pb facs="0419" n="395" xml:id="pg_395"/>
                        <p>The president repeated his regret, requested me to leave the copy of your
                            despatch that he might lay it before the federal council, and promised
                            to talk with me further on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Having waited nearly a week without having received any communication or
                            any suggestion, I deem it proper to report progress to this extent
                            without longer waiting. Should I have soon more to report, I will report
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the Israelite question, the exigencies of commerce are
                            rapidly solving it, and are quite too important for a few small Catholic
                            cantons to long hold out against the tolerant tendencies of the age. In
                            a commercial treaty just concluded between France and Switzerland it is
                            understood that the right of French Jews to have and enjoy all the
                            privileges accorded to Christians in every part of Switzerland was made
                            a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of its completion. As the treaty
                            is not yet published, I cannot vouch for the absolute accuracy of this
                            understanding.</p>

                            be a naturalized citizen of the United States, now sick and poor in his
                            native canton of St. Gall, whither he returned and married some five
                            years since.</p>
                        <p>In my two notes to the federal council, herewith subjoined, I have
                            ventured to give <hi rend="italic">my</hi> construction of article 3 of
                            the treaty existing between the United States and Switzerland, which
                            evidently differs from that of the authorities of St. Gall, and
                            according to which they make the reclamation, to which my notes are in
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>I will not repeat what I have there written, but will ask the attention
                            of the State Department to the correspondence, and <hi rend="italic"
                                >your</hi> approval of, or dissent from the views I have expressed.
                            To me it is clear that the demand in relation to Zweifel is unwarranted
                            by the terms of the treaty, and inadmissible on general principles. But,
                            perhaps, you may think differently, and in such case, or in any case, I
                            shall be content to follow instructions, and thankful for suggestions in
                            relation to the true course to be pursued in this and similar cases.</p>
                        <p>With sincere respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>In referring to the correspondence which it already has had the honor to
                            exchange with the legation from the United States of America accredited
                            to the confederation, concerning the individual named Jean Zweifel, of
                            Brooklyn, State <pb facs="0420" n="396" xml:id="pg_396"/> of New York,
                            the federal council has the honor to present to Mr. Fogg as follows:</p>
                        <p>Jean Zweifel, antecedently citizen of the commune of St. Gall, at
                            Kallbrunn, emigrated in 1851 to North America, and acquired the right of
                            citizen at Brooklyn, by certificate of 28th July, 1859.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of this acquisition, Zweifel renounced by act 16th August
                            of the same year the rights of citizen communal and cantonal of St.
                            Gall, and was, in consequence, released by resolution of 7th December,
                            1859, from the ties which connected him with his original country.</p>
                        <p>Zweifel returned about 18 months afterwards from America to the canton of
                            St. Gall, married in the canton of Glavis a girl coming from the commune
                            of Rieden, in St. Gall, had by her one child, and settled in the last
                            commune, where he still sojourns with his wife and child.</p>
                        <p>By the tenor of a report of the communal council of Rieden, of the 5th
                            current, Jean Zweifel lives with his family in the greatest indigence,
                            and being affected, as appears by a physician’s certificate, with a
                            chronic pulmonary complaint of grave character is not possible for him
                            to maintain himself and provide food for himself and family. At the
                            request of the government of St. Gall, the federal council begs the
                            minister resident of the United States of America to be so good as to
                            procure, in the mode it shall judge proper, contributions in favor of
                            Jean Zweifel and his family, citizens of the American Union.</p>
                        <p>If the condition in which Jean Zweifel is found should not improve, the
                            government of St. Gall would find itself obliged to insist on his being
                            sent back to America, in conformity with article 3 of the treaty
                            concluded between the Swiss confederation and the United States of
                            America of the North, of 25th November, 1850.</p>
                        <p>In expectation of overtures which the minister resident of the United
                            States of America may be in position to make in consequence of this
                            communication, the federal council has the honor to renew to him the
                            assurances of its high consideration.</p>
                        <p>In the name of the Federal Council, the President of the
                            Confederation,</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, minister resident, &amp;c., &amp;c., has the honor to
                            acknowledge the note of the high federal council concerning the case of
                            a certain named John Zweifel, alleged to have been in the canton of St.
                            Gall, from whence he emigrated to the United States, and was naturalized
                            in Brooklyn, State of New York, and shortly after returned to St. Gall,
                            married a woman of the commune of Rieden, in said canton, where he is
                            now living with his family in great poverty, the result of pulmonary
                            disease.</p>
                        <p>In response to the demand of the government of St. Gall forwarded by the
                            federal council, that aid be furnished to the said John Zweifel and his
                            family, the undersigned would say that, while he profoundly sympathises
                            with the unfortunate condition of Mr. Zweifel, he has no authority to
                            furnish or procure the aid asked for. The government of the United
                            States takes no cognizance of poverty or mendicity. It is a question
                            exclusively for the several states, countries, and communes. By the laws
                            of the several states, provision is made for the aid and maintenance of
                            all poor persons without distinction of origin or nationality, <pb
                                facs="0421" n="397" xml:id="pg_397"/> who may find themselves within
                            the limits of those States; but there is no law requiring the
                            authorities of those States to follow and relieve the necessities of
                            persons, whether native or naturalized citizens, who choose to emigrate
                            and become residents of a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>To return to Mr. Zweifel, the undersigned, without wishing to discuss the
                            question, would respectfully suggest a doubt whether the case comes
                            fairly within the provision of “article 3 of the treaty concluded
                            between Switzerland and the United States, the 25th Nov. 1850.” The
                            question may be raised, is not Switzerland “<hi rend="italic">le pays

                        <p>The federal council has given information to the government of the canton
                            of St. Gall of the declaration contained in the note of 30th May last
                            from the minister resident of the United States of America, importing
                            that he is not in position to be enabled to supply or procure for the
                            family of Jean Zweifel, of Brooklyn, State of New York, fallen sick and
                            destitute of means of living, the contributions solicited in his
                            behalf.</p>
                        <p>This declaration has appeared extraordinary to the government of St.
                            Gall, which declares that it cannot admit the construction given by Mr.
                            Fogg to article 3 of the treaty concluded between the Swiss
                            Confederation and the United States of North America, the 25th February,
                            1850. It appears to that government that the minister resident has not
                            noticed the last paragraph of article 3 of said treaty, which takes away
                            every sort of doubt upon the meaning of this article.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 of the treaty says very clearly, that, ex gr., a citizen of the
                            American Union who shall be sent away under the laws about mendicity, as
                            is the case of J. Zweifel, of Brooklyn, shall be received with his wife
                            and children in the country where he shall have preserved his rights in
                            conformity to the laws. But J. Zweifel has not preserved his primitive
                            rights of citizenship in the canton of St. Gall; after having formally
                            renounced that right, and having acquired the right of citizen of
                            Brooklyn, he not only has been, with the consent of the competent
                            authority of the commune of Kaltbrun, released in all the forms of law
                            by the government of St. Gall, the 7th December, 1859, from the ties
                            which united him to that state, but, moreover, the fortune which he
                            owned in the. canton of St. Gall, and which was under pupillary
                            administration, was returned to him. Per contra, Jean Zweifel has
                            preserved the right of citizen of Brooklyn, and it is thence, according
                            to article 3, several times mentioned, very clear, that he should be
                            sent back, he, his wife and his children, because of his indigence, and
                            should be received at all times and under all circumstances at
                            Brooklyn.</p>
                        <p>The government of St. Gall must, in consequence, solemnly reserve to
                            itself the evident right which it has to send back J. Zweifel and his
                            family to Brooklyn, and it expresses the expectation that the minister
                            resident of the United States of America would please to take the steps
                            necessary, with the competent authority of the State of New York or the
                            authority of the city of Brooklyn, to obtain from it the expense of the
                            subsisting and transportation needful in favor of J. Zweifel and his
                            family.</p>
                        <pb facs="0422" n="398" xml:id="pg_398"/>

                            council hopes that it will be favorably received by Mr. George G.
                            Fogg.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, minister resident, &amp;c., has the honor to acknowledge
                            the receipt of the note of the high federal council calling his
                            attention to the demand made upon him by the authorities of the canton
                            of St. Gall, in relation to one <hi rend="italic">Jean Zweifel</hi>,
                            alleged to be a naturalized citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>By reference to a former communication of the high federal council, it
                            appears that the said Jean Zweifel is a native of the canton of St.
                            Gall, from whence he emigrated to the United States in the year 1851,
                            and acquired the rights of citizenship in Brooklyn, State of New York,
                            in 1859, and that, subsequently, he returned to his native canton of St,
                            Gall, where he remained a citizen and inhabitant of said canton and
                            there became the father of a child, and has resided there with his
                            family ever since. It further appears that he, Zweifel, is affected with
                            a serious pulmonary malady, in consequence of which he is in extreme
                            indigence, and is unable to maintain himself and his said family.</p>
                        <p>Upon this state of facts, the authorities of St. Gall, through the high
                            federal council, ask of the undersigned that he take the necessary steps
                            to obtain from the authorities of the State of New York, or of the city
                            of Brooklyn, the means of maintaining the said Zweifel and his family in
                            their present place of abode, or of transporting them to America.</p>
                        <p>To this demand, the undersigned can do little more than repeat what he
                            had the honor to communicate to the high federal council in his note of
                            May 30, 1863.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 of the treaty concluded between the Swiss Confederation and the
                            United States provides that:</p>
                        <p>“The citizens of one of the two republics residing or established in the
                            other who shall desire to return to their country, or who shall be <hi
                                rend="italic">sent thither</hi> by a judicial decision, by an act of
                            police, or in conformity with the laws and regulations on morals and
                            mendicity, shall be <hi rend="italic">received</hi> at all times and
                            under all circumstances, <pb facs="0423" n="399" xml:id="pg_399"/> they,
                            their wives, and their legitimate issue in the country to which they
                            belong, and in which they shall have preserved their rights, in
                            conformity with the laws thereof.”</p>
                        <p>Now, unless the undersigned entirely misapprehends the import of the
                            above article, here is no engagement on the part either of Switzerland
                            or of the United States to follow and bring back their emigrant citizens
                            residing or established in the territories of the other—be those
                            citizens sick or well, rich or poor. There is only, as it appears to the
                            undersigned, the engagement that if the authorities of one of the two
                            republics shall, “by a judical decision, by an act of police, or in
                            conformity with the laws and regulations on. morals and mendicity,” send
                            back the citizens of the other residing within its territory, such
                            citizens thus sent back shall be <hi rend="italic">received</hi> with
                            their wives and children, “in the country to which they belong, and in
                            which they shall have preserved their rights.”</p>
                        <p>Without at this time raising the question whether, according to the terms
                            of the treaty, the wife and child of Jean Zweifel may rightfully be sent
                                <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to the United States—they having been
                            born and always resided in Switzerland— the undersigned would
                            respectfully suggest that the only mode of proceeding under the treaty
                            is for the authorities of St. Gall to send, at their own expense, the
                            said Jean Zweifel, with or without his family, back to New York, or
                            rather to Brooklyn, of which last city he is alleged to be a citizen. If
                            he shall be “received” as is provided for in the treaty, there will be
                            no necessity for any diplomatic interference whatever, or for any appeal
                            to the federal government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>And, in any case, the undersigned has the honor to inform the high
                            federal council that inasmuch as he sustains no official relations with
                            the State of New York, nor with the city of Brooklyn, he can only
                            communicate to his government copies of this correspondence and await
                            their instructions. Meanwhile he takes occasion to repeat what he said
                            in a former note, that the government of the United States takes no
                            cognizance of pauperism, or mendicity, which pertain exclusively to the
                            local authorities, State, couuty, or communal.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that the general views and suggestions herewith submitted may be
                            found correct, and commend themselves to the judgment of the high
                            federal council, the undersigned takes this occasion to renew to their
                            excellencies the assurance of his high respect and consideration.</p>

                            advising my attendance, “in an unofficial manner,” upon the sessions of
                            the International Sanitary Congress, to be held the ensuing week at
                            Geneva, is received. I shall do so with pleasure, subject to the
                            contingency you suggest.</p>
                        <p>The object of the originators of this congress is undoubtedly good and
                            worthy of encouragement; whether, however, the object is likely to be
                            attained in the way proposed is at least problematical. I confess to
                            great doubts on the subject, doubts which the result will confirm or
                            dissipate.</p>
                        <p>I could have wished, however, in view of the great practical solving by
                            our countrymen and countrywomen of nearly all the problems likely to be
                            considered by this congress, that some member of the United States
                            National Sanitary Commission, familiar with the practical working of
                            that organization, and able to speak from personal observation on the
                            field of battle and in the hospitals, should have been commissioned,
                            either by the government or by the Sanitary Commission <pb facs="0424"
                                n="400" xml:id="pg_400"/> itself. The exhibit such a person would
                            have been able to make would, I am sure, have told more powerfully than
                            any theories in favor of the ends sought to be realized by the
                            originators of the proposed congress.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of such a person, I shall cheerfully communicate such
                            facts as I may be in possession of, and which may appear apposite to the
                            purpose and spirit of the occasion, not of course venturing to do or say
                            anything which can be construed into a committal of the government of

                            response to mine of July 13 indorsing my correspondence with the federal
                            council in reply to the demand of the authorities of the canton of St.
                            Gall that one John Zweifel, alleged to be a naturalized pauper citizen
                            of the United States, be supported in St. Gall or transported to New
                            York, by the authorities of the United States, has been received, and I
                            thank you for the approval you have been pleased to accord to the views
                            contained in my share of that correspondence. Although you did not
                            expressly authorize me to do so, I deemed the importance of the question
                            a sufficient warrant for transmitting a copy of your despatch to the
                            federal council. And this, indeed, courtesy seemed to require, inasmuch
                            as in my last note, a copy of which I enclosed to you, I informed the
                            federal council that I should send the entire correspondence to the
                            State Department and await your instructions.</p>
                        <p>The entire question is so plainly and exhaustively treated by you that I
                            do not anticipate a response; much less a renewal of the pending or of a
                            similar demand. Indeed, 1 apprehend the question was never seriously
                            considered in connexion with the treaty by the federal council, but that

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Your despatch of July 28, No. 55<hi
                                rend="italic">,</hi> approving of the tenor of my verbal explanation
                            to the president of the confederation, of the reasons which render it
                            impracticable, at present, for the United States government to enter
                            into a treaty stipulation, as proposed by him, for the protection of
                            Swiss citizens by American consuls, has been received.</p>
                        <p>As the president has not since resumed the conversation, as he proposed,
                            I have not deemed it necessary to acquaint him with the additional
                            suggestions <pb facs="0425" n="401" xml:id="pg_401"/> contained in your
                            last despatch. Indeed, no practical advantage can come of pressing the
                                <hi rend="italic">other</hi> question—that of Israelitish
                            toleration—inasmuch as that question is settling itself as rapidly as
                            possible. As I intimated in my despatch of July 2, the treaty recently
                            concluded between France and Switzerland expressly guarantees the right
                            of French subjects, without distinction of faith or worship, to travel,
                            sojourn, and transact all lawful business, as freely as Swiss Christian
                            residents of other cantons may do the same. This treaty is not yet <hi
                                rend="italic">ratified</hi> by the federal assembly, comprising the
                            two branches of the national legislature, which bodies are to have an
                            adjourned session the 20th of September next.</p>
                        <p>It is known that there will be opposition to the treaty in those bodies,
                            and this principally on account of the Jew-tolerating provision. But
                            there is believed to be no serious doubt that the treaty will be
                            ratified on account of the commercial and industrial advantages secured
                            to the citizens of Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>The treaty with France once ratified, the whole question is <hi
                                rend="italic">practically</hi> settled. When the thousands of <hi
                                rend="italic">French</hi> Jews are tolerated and protected, it will
                            be absurd to proscribe and persecute the dozens or hundreds of other
                            nations. Besides, there are now pending several treaties with other
                            governments containing the same guarantee in favor of the Jews, and the
                            ratification of the French treaty will seal the success of the others,
                            and, without serious doubt, put an end to all complaints and
                            reclamations on account of disabilities founded on difference of
                            religious faith and worship.</p>
                        <p>Promising to acquaint you with the fate of the French treaty in the
                            national assembly, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
                            obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In my despatch of August 29, I informed
                            you of the negotiation by the federal council of a commercial treaty
                            between Switzerland and France, in which is conceded to all French
                            subjects, “without distinction of faith or worship,” the right to
                            sojourn and transact all branches of lawful industry and commerce in
                            every part of Switzerland, subject only to such regulations and
                            restrictions as may be rightfully imposed upon all classes of Swiss
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>I further informed you that there would be held, on the 20th of
                            September, a special session of the federal assembly, (a congress,) to
                            consider and ratify, or to reject the treaty. Since then the session has
                            been held, and has just adjourned, having ratified the treaty by a very
                            large majority. There was strenuous opposition to the ratification by
                            the representatives of several of the small Catholic cantons, among the
                            people of which prevails a strong prejudice against the Jews, whom they
                            regard as still tainted with all the sins of their fathers, who
                            crucified the Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p>There were also some <hi rend="italic">liberals,</hi> “strict
                            constructionists,” who opposed the ratification on <hi rend="italic"
                                >constitutional</hi> grounds, they arguing that neither the federal
                            council nor the federal assembly have the power to admit Jews to an
                            equality of rights with Christians, in disregard of the laws of those
                            cantons which deny them such equality. To effect this object it was
                            contended that a change of the federal constitution was necessary. This
                            position, however, was not sustained by the majority, which decided the
                            treaty expedient, and not in contravention of the constitution.</p>
                        <pb facs="0426" n="402" xml:id="pg_402"/>
                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">principle,</hi> therefore, the question so long
                            mooted, and which occasioned so voluminous a correspondence between my
                            predecessor, Mr. Fay, and the Swiss authorities, may be regarded as
                            settled. The <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> question may also, I
                            trust, be regarded as settled, in accordance with the demands of
                            enlightened Christian opinion in both Europe and America. The treaty
                            just ratified secures, it is true, only the rights of French Jews; but
                            it will be followed by treaties with other powers, and must, in the end,
                            enfranchise the whole race, since the Swiss authorities having taken the
                            first step in a movement so obviously just, and so imperatively demanded
                            by the spirit of the age and their own position as the vanguard of
                            liberty in Europe, they cannot recede, but must go forward.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the despatches of the department to No. 24 inclusive, the
                            contents of which have been duly noted.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the quantity of cotton reported in appendix B, of my
                            despatch No. 31, as exported from Egypt during 1862, only represents
                            about the third of the crop actually raised, the whole amount of ginned
                            cotton produced last season being nearly fifteen hundred thousand’
                            ginned cantars.</p>
                        <p>This year the breadth of land declared by the local officers of the
                            government to be sown with cotton is 700,000 acres, promising the
                            unprecedented yield of from two millions to twenty-five hundred thousand
                            cantars.</p>
                        <p>The Nile has risen higher this season than for many years, but the canals
                            are so clean, and the Viceroy has taken such precautions, that the fear
                            of a destructive inundation has almost passed away. Such an accident
                            would ruin both the cotton and Indian corn, (the latter the principal
                            food crop of the country.) The cotton will be ready to commence
                            gathering by the middle of the present month.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Since my last despatch, No. 43, nothing of
                            special importance has occurred in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As you are already advised, the cotton crop is in great excess of former
                            years; indeed, the value of it is estimated at about two-fifths that of
                            the crop of the United States in former years. But there is a great
                            deficiency in the means of transportation to market, owing to the almost
                            entire monopoly of the freight trains by the Viceroy and his friends,
                            and the absence of steamboat communication on the Nile. Thousands of
                            bales are consequently delayed at the stations on the line of the
                            railroad, waiting week after week for a chance to be taken to the port
                            of Alexandria. At present there is an active demand at $44 per 100
                            pounds for middling, though at times the price has been as high as
                            $50.</p>
                        <p>Not long since a rumor that France was about to recognize the southern
                            confederacy caused a reduction in price, and bargains were made on the
                            strength of that report which resulted in very heavy losses to
                                sellers<hi rend="italic">;</hi> for no sooner was the rumor
                            circulated than it was disproved by events, which brought the article up
                            again.</p>
                        <p>The Viceroy is still occupied with his controversy about the Suez canal—a
                            controversy still unsettled, although the works are not interrupted.
                            Among his recent acts indicating a disposition to reforms, is the
                            establishment of prizes for marksmanship among his soldiers, and of
                            races twice a year at Cairo and Alexandria for the improvement of the
                            breed of horses here, which, by the way, has <pb facs="0429" n="405"
                                xml:id="pg_405"/> greatly declined of late. The prizes are offered
                            by government to the competition of horses of all nations.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of December the extension of the fresh-water canal from
                            the Nile to Suez was celebrated at the latter place, with the proper
                            ceremonies. A navigable canal of fresh water over 200 miles long now
                            pours itself into the Red sea, staining its waters for two or three
                            miles, a thing unknown since the days of the Pharaohs, when the products
                            of India were transported by a similar canal to the European shores of
                            the Mediterranean. This new canal, though primarily intended for the
                            benefit of the French colonies on the line of the Suez maritime canal,
                            will be of great use to the natives of Egypt, by fertilizing large
                            tracts of what is now desert land, and supplying Suez with an abundance
                            of potable water. Not less than $16,000 have heretofore been paid by
                            this government for the annual supply of water required by railroad and
                            steamships at the latter place.</p>
                        <p>An unusual number of travellers has gone up the Nile this winter. Among
                            the distinguished Europeans who have arrived is Mr. Rougét, of France,
                            the most eminent living Egyptologist. Mr. Rougét is commissioned by the
                            Emperor of the French to take a photographic copy of every hieroglyphic
                            inscription and painting in Egypt, and to furnish a translation of them.
                            The preservation of these vanishing records will be a great service to
                            science. It is also worthy of mention that Mariette, a French savant,
                            distinguished for his archaeological labors here, has erected and
                            arranged at Cairo, for the Viceroy of Egypt, during the past year, an
                            admirable museum of Egyptian antiquities, in some respects not equalled
                            by any other in the world.</p>
                        <p>While referring to these researches of the French, I may. record the
                            mission of Professor Desjardins of the Ecole Normale at Paris, who, a
                            year ago, came to Egypt by imperial order, to examine the traces of
                            ancient Roman domination here. The results of his investigation will
                            appear, it is said, in the Emperor’s forthcoming life of Julius
                            Caesar.</p>
                        <p>In announcing, in my last despatch, the appointment of Mr. Charles Marsh
                            as vice-consul at Cairo, I neglected to mention the reason for the
                            dismissal of his predecessor, a Levantine English subject, named Robert
                            I. Wilkinson; this individual having been detected in practices
                            degrading to the character of an officer of our government, and, on
                            having his attention called to the subject, declared himself wholly
                            independent of the United States, avowing publicly and repeatedly that
                            he was in correspondence with Jeff. Davis’s agent, who, as he said, had
                            promised to make him consul-general of the so-called southern
                            confederacy. He (Wilkinson) also threatened to raise the flag of the
                            southern confederacy in one month, and to surrender to said secession
                            agent the consular archives, which he had removed from the consular
                            office, and which had to be recovered from him by the forcible
                            assistance of the local police. Whether his declarations were well
                            founded or not, they were used by him (unsuccessfully, however, with few
                            exceptions) to induce our protégés to withdraw from the jurisdiction of
                            our government. Ordinarily, I should not regard the attempt to lessen
                            the number of our protégés as a grievance, but, under present
                            circumstances, it certainly shows the disposition of the offender to
                            give aid and comfort to our enemies. Such delinquencies of Mr.
                            Wilkinson, (which are authentically attested,) in my opinion, required
                            his prompt dismissal, which took place on the 20th of last November.</p>

                            Marsh, while on a visit here, was confined to his bed a few days by
                            typhoid fever, of so mild a type that neither himself nor his physicians
                            apprehended any serious result, although such attacks are generally more
                            trying to men of his vigorous physique and sanguine temperament than to
                            others. On Sunday, the 24th, he for the first time expressed himself as
                            feeling seriously unwell, and at 4 p. m. a rush of blood to the head
                            rendered him insensible. In this condition he remained until his death,
                            seven hours later. He was assiduously attended by three of the most
                            skilful European physicians in the Viceroy’s service.</p>
                        <p>On the afternoon of the 26th ultimo the funeral ceremonies were
                            solemnized at the consulate and in the Church of St. Catherine. They
                            were attended by the chief functionaries of the local government, and
                            the consular representatives of the different nations, in uniform,
                            besides a very large concourse of European residents, many of whom,
                            notwithstanding the shortness of his stay, had known the deceased well
                            enough to feel a sense of personal loss in his death. Among the
                            pall-bearers were consular officers of England, Russia, Italy, and
                            Holland. The remains were placed in the Catholic cemetery of
                            Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>At the time of his decease Mr. Marsh had hardly attained the prime of
                            life, and up to the last illness seemed the embodiment of vigorous
                            health. No requisite of happiness and prosperous fortune was wanting to
                            him. His eminent social qualities, his generosity and talents had gained
                            him an unusually large circle of friends in America and Europe. He had
                            been the trusted associate of Mr. Webster and others of our leading
                            statesmen; but as a rule had declined to accept official preferment for
                            himself. Only once, I believe, he consented to represent his native
                            city, Portsmouth, in the New Hampshire house of representatives, where
                            he was nominated by one of the two great parties for the speakership. He
                            was a graduate of Harvard College, and his published volumes of
                            Reminiscences of Mr. Webster, and of travels in Madeira and Spain; as
                            well as his various contributions to magazines and journals, had given
                            him a creditable place in American literature.</p>
                        <p>It was but November last that Mr. Marsh accompanied me from Paris to this
                            country, in the fulness of health and pleasant expectations. Few indeed
                            of his many friends will be prepared for the affliction which thus
                            befalls them.</p>
                        <p>The steps required by law in relation to the property of the deceased
                            have been duly taken, and the proper information communicated to his
                            brother, Mr. Clement Marsh, of Portsmouth, N. H.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to report, that soon
                            after the date of my last despatch a formal interview was arranged for
                            the presentation of my credentials from the <pb facs="0431" n="407"
                                xml:id="pg_407"/> President of the United States to the Viceroy of
                            Egypt, in the usual manner. The interview was postponed from time to
                            time, on account of the great heat, the indisposition of the Viceroy,
                            and the more serious illness of his minister, Cherif Pacha. Not less
                            than four or five messages were sent to me, during this interval, to
                            excuse the delay, but as the Viceroy had received me informally,
                            immediately on my arrival in Egypt, there was no substantial reason for
                            regretting it. The reception took place last week at Cairo.</p>
                        <p>The state ceremonial rigorously observed by this oriental court on such
                            occasions, to do honor to the representatives of other countries
                            accredited to it, has been faithfully described in the official
                            communications of my predecessors; referring to these to avoid
                            repetition, I content myself with remarking that nothing of the usages
                            was omitted in the present instance which could testify the respect of
                            the Egyptian government for our own, or express their cordial welcome to
                            the representative of the United States. The consuls general of Persia,
                            of Greece, and of Brazil were also received by the Viceroy the same
                            week; precedence, however, was accorded to me. In presenting the letters
                            of the President I made a brief address to the Viceroy in French, of the
                            tenor prescribed by my instructions; to which the Viceroy replied, in
                            the same language, reciprocating the President’s expressions of good
                            will, and promising that nothing should be lacking on his part for the
                            maintenance of the most friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>The same day Cherif Pacha, the minister of foreign affairs, called upon
                            me at my hotel; and although such visits, being regarded as merely
                            ceremonious, usually last but a few minutes, it may be remarked that in
                            the present instance the minister remained nearly two hours, engaged in
                            earnest conversation. He said that he would have much to say, by way of
                            complaint, of the irregular proceedings of Mr. Dainese, but that the
                            arrival of a new representative of our government inclined him to allow
                            these grievances (which it is painful to say are personal as well as
                            political) to be forgotten. Passing to a broader field after this
                            generous consideration, he asked for the latest news from
                            America—manifesting a very accurate information and an enlightened
                            interest in our struggle to maintain the integrity of our Union. He
                            recurred to the conversations which he used to have with my predecessor,
                            Mr. Thayer, on the subject; and declared that the progress of events had
                            not in the least shaken his confidence in the strength of our cause, and
                            in our ultimate and perfect success, opinions which he expressed at the
                            beginning of our war, and repeated to the late Viceroy, Said Pacha, in
                            the presence of the Emperor of the French, in the year 1862.</p>
                        <p>Mr. George C. Taylor, appointed by the President to be consul at Cairo,
                            having arrived in Egypt shortly before the official reception, I
                            presented him to the Viceroy, immediately after my own reception, and,
                            in accordance with the instruction No. 32, addressed to my predecessor,
                            I applied to the government of his Highness for the necessary
                            recognition to enable Mr. Taylor to enter upon his duties, which was
                            immediately granted, and Mr. Taylor is now at Cairo in their
                            discharge.</p>
                        <p>The members of the consular corps who happened to be in Cairo called upon
                            me there, and the others since my return to Alexandria, and I have
                            returned their visits. These courtesies have been exchanged with the
                            most hearty good will. The consuls general accredited to the Viceroy now
                            number seventeen, from the following countries, besides our own:
                            Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Greece,
                            Hanseatic Towns, Italy, Netherlands, Persia, Portugal, Prussia, Russia,
                            Spain, Sweden, and Norway.</p>
                        <p>The whole body of consuls general was convened at the ministry of foreign
                            affairs to-day, at the instance of Cherif Pacha, to receive a project
                            for the establishment of a municipality for the better government of the
                            city of Alexandra. The imperative necessity of some such measure will be
                            apparent when it is observed that Alexandria, most happily situated near
                            the junction of three continents, is fast regaining the position it
                            anciently occupied in the commerce <pb facs="0432" n="408"
                                xml:id="pg_408"/> of the Old World; its trade embraces nearly all
                            countries; it is a city of about 150,000 inhabitants, of whom about
                            50,000 “enjoy the rights of nationality,” as it is called; that is to
                            say, are excepted from the operation of the local laws, being subject to
                            the jurisdiction of the seventeen consulates general. It is plain that
                            no proper municipal government can be had with jurisdictions so
                            diverse.</p>
                        <p>It must be recollected that one of the incidents of this system is the
                            complete exemption from taxation of all the fifly thousand Franks,
                            comprising the most wealthy of the inhabitants of the town. The
                            government cannot with justice keep the streets drained, swept, paved
                            and lighted, either at the expense of the poor rayahs, nor assess the
                            cost upon the general revenues of the country It follows that the
                            streets are always in a most filthy and dangerous condition; life and
                            limb are insecure, and the advantages of civilization are lost among a
                            numerous and wealthy community. The European residents are generally not
                            only willing to be taxed for municipal purposes, but earnestly ask for
                            the municipality. It is only desired that there shall be due safeguards
                            to prevent oppression and to secure the proper application of the moneys
                            raised.</p>
                        <p>In Constantinople, and it is believed also some of the large towns of
                            China where the system of exterritoriality prevails, the adoption of a
                            municipality of some kind has been found necessary, and has received the
                            assent of the representatives of the Christian powers, including our
                            own.</p>
                        <p>There was an entire accord among the consuls general present at the
                            meeting to-day (which included representatives of all except Portugal
                            and Brazil) in accepting the principle of the municipality, and a
                            memorandum to this effect was signed by us all. With reference to the
                            details of the plan, in which much difference of opinion exists, it was
                            agreed that the consuls general should meet to compare opinions on the
                            1st of December.</p>
                        <p>The United States have here few permanent residents to be affected by the
                            scheme, and the opinion of these I shall be careful to gather; the
                            important interests of the missionaries will be protected by the
                            exemption from taxation which it is proposed to allow to property used
                            for religious purposes; while all American travellers will be benefited,
                            without cost, by the public improvements which the plan, if successfully
                            carried out, will give to the town.</p>
                        <p>You understand, of course, that nothing is proposed which will be
                            inconsistent with the express terms of the famous “capitulations” or of
                            existing treaties, and nothing which is inconsistent in principle with
                            the system already adopted for Constantinople, with the assent of the
                            Christian powers.</p>
                        <p>Great care in arranging the details of the plan will unquestionably be
                            exercised by the representatives of powers, who have here numerous
                            colonies of subjects, some of them counted by thousands; and I trust
                            that it may be agreeable to the department to authorize me to acquiesce
                            in behalf of the United States in the adoption of such plan, not
                            inconsistent with the important limitations already expressed, as may
                            appear satisfactory after consultation with our citizens here, and not
                            objectionable to the representatives of powers having greater interests
                            involved. In view of the distance of America, to ask a delay for
                            communication at each step in the proceedings, when we have but few
                            citizens here, would be distasteful to the Viceroy’s government, which
                            takes a deep interest in the plan, and is anxious for its speedy
                            adoption. Indeed, its forbearance in hearing objections is
                            remarkable.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your instruction No. 3 in
                            reference to the acknowledgment of a generous contribution in Egypt in
                            aid of the widows and orphans of the defenders of the Union, and to
                            report that I expressed the thanks of the government by a letter

                        <p>The term of service of Captain G. Frank Stevens, appointed provisionally
                            vice-consul at Cairo, was honorably ended upon the arrival of Mr.

                        <p>For vice-consul at Alexandria I have appointed Mr. Y. Barthow, one of the
                            most respectable, as he is one of the oldest Frank residents of Egypt;
                            he may truly be said to be the oldest American here, for he was born on
                            the soil, of American parentage, (his father was a native of New
                            Jersey,) under the United States flag. He has for a long time been in
                            the actual discharge of the duties of vice-consul, but, as it appears,
                            his name has not heretofore been formally communicated to the
                            department. I deem it proper now to make the nomination, and
                            respectfully request for it the approval of the government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            late despatches up to No. 15 of the 5th ultimo, including your private
                            communication of the same date.</p>
                        <p>Before the receipt of your latest communications on the subject of the
                            hostility which has recently been manifested towards the Jewish
                            population of Morocco, the attention of the department had been called
                            to it by the board of delegates of American Israelites at New York. A
                            copy of their letter, dated the 25th of November, and of my reply, dated
                            the 3d instant, is herewith enclosed. I send also a transcript of a
                            letter relating to the same subject, dated the 1st instant, addressed to
                            the Assistant Secretary of State by the secretary of the board of
                            delegates.</p>
                        <p>If the facts represented to you by the governing committee of the Hebrew
                            congregation at Tangier, and derived by you from other sources, should
                            be confirmed by subsequent investigation of the painful occurrence which
                            took place at Saffi, you are authorized to exert all proper influence to
                            prevent a repetition of the barbarous cruelties to which Israelites in
                            the Moorish empire have, on account of their religion, been subjected.
                            Such a course, which is dictated by common humanity, will, no doubt, be
                            pursued by the representatives of all the Christian powers at Tangier,
                            and their united efforts will, it is believed, effectually check the
                            proceedings complained of.</p>

                            matter in which we feel assured that we have your sympathy, and can rely
                            upon your kind offices in adopting our suggestions, as far as may be
                            consistent with the policy and views of our government.</p>
                        <p>Information has reached us of the renewal of atrocities and barbarities
                            toward the Jewish population of Tangier, that are regarded as foreboding
                            a general persecution of the Israelites of Morocco. Such a powerful
                            effect has the bare recital of these outrages had upon the minds of our
                            co-religionists in Great Britain, to whom the intelligence was first
                            communicated, that they have commissioned the venerable Sir Moses
                            Montefiore to visit the scene and represent them; and, accompanied by
                            two other gentlemen of the “Board of Deputies of British Jews,” he has
                            set out for Morocco, assured of the cordial co-operation and sympathy of
                            the British government, who have, we understand, tendered him the aid
                            and influence of their representatives in Morocco, whom they have
                            instructed to farther the mission of the Jewish representatives in
                            securing justice to unoffending, innocent Israelites, accused of fearful
                            crimes, and barbarously <pb facs="0435" n="411" xml:id="pg_411"/>
                            tortured, and several executed, in response to the cruel mandates of the
                            Emperor of Morocco at the solicitation of the Spanish authorities.</p>
                        <p>What we desire to represent to your department is our earnest hope that
                            you* will convey to the United States consul at Tangier the instructions
                            of our government that he will co-operate with the British authorities
                            in measures that may be taken to further the mission of Sir Moses
                            Montefiore authorizing him to proceed to as great an extent as may be
                            consistent with the relations of this government and the Barbary States
                            in securing justice to these unfortunate people and preventing the
                            general persecution apprehended.</p>
                        <p>As a precedent we need only refer to the action of the United States
                            during the administration of Mr. Van Buren, about the year 1840, when
                            Mr. Forsyth, then Secretary of State, instructed the American
                            representative near Damascus to exercise his influence in the case of
                            similar atrocities there, when the same steps as here indicated were
                            taken by our British co-religionists, assisted by the British
                            government, and indorsed by our authorities, at the solicitation of
                            American Israelites.</p>
                        <p>We are satisfied that it is only necessary to submit this to your
                            department to receive the assurance that our government will, through
                            its authorized agents, signify its pain and abhorrence at these
                            outrages, and will cordially co-operate with the representatives of
                            Great Britain in furthering the humane and benevolent mission of Sir
                            Moses Montefiore as far as it consistently can.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_412"/> the honor of transmitting to you yesterday, the
                            appeal itself being a copy of the statement presented to the “Board of
                            Deputies of British Jews.” This postcript is, perhaps, the most
                            essential portion to be transmitted to the departments, the details
                            being already communicated. I shall, however, take occasion to send a
                            copy of the entire document.</p>
                        <p>I should be sorry should any delay on my part have prevented the
                            department coming to an early conclusion in the matter, as it would be
                            extremely gratifying to this board to be able to communicate as soon as
                            practicable to our brethren at Tangier the assurance that the United
                            States government will be prompt as ever to exercise its powerful
                            influence in behalf of the oppressed, and that it will cordially
                            sympathize with the mission undertaken by Sir Moses Montefiore, to
                            secure justice to the innocent, and the prevention of the apprehended
                            persecution.</p>

                            <p>P. S.—The equal to this despatch was transmitted to the “Board of
                                Deputies of the British Jews in London,” and to the “Central
                                Consistory,” and to the “Universal Israelitish to Alliance” of
                                Paris, and we doubt not that those respectable boards, with their
                                usual zeal, will interest themselves with their respective
                                governments, in order that they may intercede with the government of
                                Morocco, so that injustice may not be committed against their
                                brethren in Morocco; and this we expect of you as co-religionists
                                and inhabitants of a country of liberty and justice, and under a
                                government full of civilization, liberal, just, and humane, that you
                                may be seen to interest yourselves and to intervene with the
                                honorable President of the United States that he may recommend to
                                his representative here, Jesse W. McMath, esq., a sincere man
                                sympathizing with the Hebrews, to intervene under his honorable
                                influence, and in the name of humanity, to alleviate the injustices
                                which are sought to be committed against your brethren in Morocco. A
                                recommendation of this sort will give us espiration and honor in
                                this barbarian country.</p>

                            his Majesty the Sultan to all foreign nations represented in Morocco, in
                            reference to a light-house erected by his Majesty’s order on Cape
                            Spartel, I have now the honor to transmit a copy of a letter of the 11th

                            receipt of your letter of May 19, transmitting a copy of a despatch from
                            the United States consul at Tangier, who encloses the form of a treaty
                            proposed by his Majesty the Sultan of Morocco, for the assent of the
                            commercial nations represented at his court, binding them to make annual
                            contributions for the maintenance and repair of a light-house recently
                            erected by the government of Morocco on Cape Spartel, at the entrance of
                            the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic. It appears that Morocco,
                            having no naval or commercial marine, is indisposed to assume any
                            expense in this matter, beyond that incurred in building the
                            light-house.</p>
                        <p>In the articles of agreement as originally draughted the minister of
                            Spain resident in Morocco proposes certain amendments, and you state it
                            as your impression that an arrangement in this modified form may have
                            some political value.</p>
                        <p>In view of the peculiar circumstances of the case and of the consul’s
                            statement as to the importance of the structure to the commerce of all
                            nations trading in the Mediterranean, I am of opinion that the United
                            States may very properly assume their proper share of the 15,000 francs
                            to which the annual expense is limited.</p>
                        <p>Would it not be better, however, to pay their proper proportion of the
                            principal, of which that sum would be the annual interest, and engage
                            the Sultan by treaty to maintain the light?</p>
                        <p>The change of the first article suggested by the Spanish minister seems
                            to be judicious, as it strikes out the proposed guarantee of the
                            territorial sovereignty and ownership of the light-house, and
                            substitutes a simple acknowledgment of the jurisdiction of the
                            Sultan.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> The governing committee of the Hebrew
                                community of Tangier solicit, in the name of humanity, your good
                                offices in behalf of our persecuted brethren in Morocco.</p>
                            <p>You will not ignore the Barbary cruelties, which, without any
                                reference being had to the usual forms of justice, have lately
                                befallen some of our brethren, and in consequence of which we have
                                had recourse to the Board of Deputies of British Jews in London, as
                                well as to the Central Consistory, and the “Alliance Universal
                                Israelit at Paris,” which (corporations) have given effect to their
                                customary zeal, and addressed themselves to their respective
                                governments with a view to put a stop to the said act of
                                persecutions.</p>
                            <p>It appears, however, that their action has had the effect of
                                aggravating rather than mitigating the cruelties which are daily
                                committed upon our co-religionists, and that this state of things is
                                owing to the determination to show how little regard is paid to the
                                representations made in England and France, and to the
                                disapprobation expressed by the government and press of said
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the intervention of the representatives of foreign powers,
                                many years have passed since the punishment by torture and unjust
                                and barbarous proceedings have ceased in this country, as is proved
                                by the fact that up to the time when these unfortunate Jews who had
                                been accused at Saffi were subjected to a cruel death, and the
                                recent bastinado infliction took place, without even a light cause,
                                the penalty of death has not been for many years past carried into
                                effect by the Moorish government on the persons of Jews, nor at
                                Tangier, even, that of the bastinado; but unfortunately we see with
                                much pain that this description of punishment has been
                                re-established, and, what is more to be regretted, that this is done
                                under the inspiration of the representative of a civilized nation.
                                We cannot believe that this is done with the consent of the
                                government of her Catholic Majesty, since in addition to the
                                kindness, benevolence, and kind reception which our brethren who
                                took refuge in their country received from her Majesty the Queen of
                                Spain, her ministers, generals, officers and subjects, during the
                                war, and the occupation of Zetnow, as well as from the unctionaries
                                who have before now represented that government in Morocco, who (the
                                latter) have always shown themselves to be the friends of the Jews,
                                and favored our brethren whenever they had the occasion to apply for
                                their good offices.</p>
                            <p>You are informed of the act of barbarity and tyranny committed two
                                days ago upon two of our co-religionists, without sufficient cause.
                                The same has been originated in a trifling dispute they had had with
                                a groom of the Spanish minister, Señor Merry, which proceeding,
                                according to the statement of the local authorities, took place at
                                the instigation of her Catholic Majesty’s minister, and surprises us
                                very much, as we cannot understand what the intentions may be of
                                that legation and consulate, operating against a race so weak and
                                defenceless as that of the Jews in Morocco.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances we implore you to take our case under
                                consideration, to lend to us your well-known aid and protection, and
                                adopt whatever measures may be necessary to do away with these acts
                                of barbarity.</p>
                            <p>The object which we <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to attain we do not
                                think we shall accomplish un less all the civilized powers interest
                                themselves in our favor, and assist us to ward of the calamitous
                                events with which our poor co-religionists, who are subjects to the
                                jurisdiction of the Moorish government, are threatened. We therefore
                                hope you will have the goodness to submit to your government this

                            <p>I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, in the name of this

                            <p>An act of horrible and heathen atrocity has just been perpetrated
                                only a narrow lattitude beyond the borders of Europe at the
                                instigation of a Christian power. It will be the less astonishing,
                                however, when we record the fact that this atrocious outrage against
                                all human nature was committed by an agent of the country of the
                                inquisition—Spain. We call attention to it in order that, if
                                possible, the Spanish government may be brought to disavow the crime
                                of its representative, a crime worthy of the most savage and gloomy
                                tyrant that ever occupied the throne of Constantinople, or wallowed
                                through a sullen career of slaughter in the blood-stained capital of
                                the Persian Shahs. The Spanish receiver general of customs at Saffi,
                                on the coast of Morocco, recently died, and upon a mere whisper of
                                scandalous suspicion his servant, a Jewish youth, only fourteen
                                years of age, named Jacob Benionda, was accused of having poisoned
                                him. There was no post-mortem examination; there were no medical
                                authorities called in; there was no judicial investigation whatever.
                                The Spanish consul, in a fit of Popish fury, instantly, summarily,
                                and peremptorily demanded that the poor Hebrew boy, with three of
                                his co-religionists should be arrested and condemned. Accordingly,
                                submissive to the fiat of this execrable little despot, the child
                                was seized and tortured, until amid the shrieks and groans of his
                                agony some vague and in all likelihood involuntary expressions
                                escaped him, which the gloating consul of Spain at once distorted
                                into a confession of guilt, and he forthwith demanded that the
                                miserable mangled victim should be prepared for death. It was done
                                at his behest; this functionary of a Christian nation stood by while
                                the unhappy boy, protesting to the last breath of life his
                                innocence, underwent the appalling doom prescribed for him by the
                                consul of her Most Catholic Majesty to the cities on the shores of
                                Morocco.</p>
                            <p>If the enormity had ended here, all Europe might have been justified
                                in protesting against a deed of vengeance and injustice so utterly
                                inconsistent with the decency, humanity, and civilization of the
                                age. But the Spanish consul was not yet satiated with blood. Much
                                more torture and much more death were necessary to appease and glut
                                his indignant spirit. There was a man named Benelous whom it was his
                                pleasure to charge as an accomplice of the child whose body lay
                                mutilated in a pool of blood at the place of execution. This unhappy
                                man was first submitted to a tremendous infliction of the bastinado
                                as it has been inflicted from time immemorial in the most barbarous
                                regions of Asia. The effect of this torture on the fla yed and
                                bleeding soles of the feet is an anguish indescribable; and, as <pb
                                    facs="0441" n="417" xml:id="pg_417"/> we shall reiterate again
                                and again, a Christian official was standing by to witness and
                                aggravate its administration. But that did not suffice. Poor
                                Benelous, over whose writhings the Roman Catholic functionary of
                                Spain so unctuously presided, remained inflexible. The bloody rod
                                would not abate his protestations of guiltlessness in the matter of
                                the Spanish collector general’s death. They next hung him up by the
                                feet naked, and continued scourging him until, under the force of
                                the blows, his body swayed to and fro like a pendulum. Still the
                                miserable Jew persisted in declaring his innocence, with that of the
                                youth and the two other men who had been impeached as his
                                accomplices in a crime which had probably never been perpetrated at
                                all. Then the bigotry of the Mohammedan reconciling itself with
                                delight to the exulting and congenial fanaticism of the Roman
                                Catholic, a third species of agony was invented for the deplorable
                                victim. They thrust him, like Regulus, naked as he was, into a cask
                                through the staves of which a thousand small and sharp nails
                                inverted their lancet-like points, and, the barrel being violently
                                rolled upon the ground, he endured a suffering which the human
                                imagination fails to realize. At last, exhausted and maddened,
                                delirious with pain, broken in spirit, and utterly reckless of
                                results, he, to escape the terrible torture, shrieked out to his
                                butchers something which they eagerly interpreted as a confession.
                                The fate of the poor Jew was sealed. They dragged him to where the
                                carcass of the young Benionda still lay shamelessly exposed, with a
                                hundred traces of brutal cruelty upon it, and there a long,
                                double-edged dagger was plunged, mercifully it may be said, from
                                behind the left clavicle bone right through his heart, and the man
                                was dead. [This is a mistake.]</p>
                            <p>Fancy, however, a Spanish gentleman, a Christian officer, a
                                countryman of Cervantes, not only beholding, but urging on and
                                insisting upon atrocities like these! Fancy him outdoing even the
                                natural and hereditary barbarisms of Morocco, and that in the
                                presence of a Spanish ship-of-war from whose mizzen flew a pennon
                                which pretends to be the emblem of civilization! These acts ought
                                not to pass without protest and execration. That boy and man were
                                accused upon no evidence whatever, were literally tried upon the
                                rack, were condemned by no legal tribunal, and were executed without
                                having been judicially condemned. Suppose an English consul, upon a
                                fanciful suspicion of some wrong done to a countryman, were to
                                insist, in China, that a man should be buried up to his neck in the
                                earth and bowled at, might he plead that such was the custom of the
                                country, and that he was only exacting justice after the aboriginal
                                fashion? We rather think that, if not hanged or condemned to chains
                                for life, he would be permanently expelled from society; although we
                                remember, with humiliation, that Cabrera has danced and been popular
                                in English drawing-rooms. We may be reminded that there was an
                                immense outcry, right or wrong, when Sir James Brooke began his
                                crusade against the pirates of Borneo; but here we have the fiendish
                                apathy of the savage executioner imported into Europe; for the
                                Spanish consulate at Saffi, in Morocco, is virtually no less a part
                                of Europe and beneath the jurisdiction of European and Christian law
                                than Madrid itself. Both these laws, however—that of Europe,
                                excepting Russia, and that of Christianity, with the same
                                exception—have been flagrantly broken. And although the victims were
                                two unfortunate and friendless Jews, belonging to a race which has
                                not lately attracted very strongly the sympathies of the world, the
                                flagitious conduct of the Spanish official was not mitigated by that
                                fact. Spain, indeed, appears determined in isolating herself from
                                among the progressing civilizations of the earth. The old gloomy
                                rancor against religious liberty which once haunted the Escurial,
                                and breathed itself forth in pitiful mutterings beneath those
                                gorgeous cathedral roofs which an ignorant eye might deem dedicated
                                to holier and nobler purposes, still haunts the stucco palaces in
                                which Queen Isabella flaunts, despised and derided by the world. It
                                was long ago said that she was the only continental monarch who
                                would not dare to propose a visit to the pure Court of St. James.
                                The teachings of her nefarious mother <pb facs="0442" n="418"
                                    xml:id="pg_418"/> have made her the scorn of humanity; but if
                                the agents of her ministers are permitted to wreak abroad cruelties
                                copied from the Red Indian school, a still deeper degeneracy will
                                become the characteristic of Spain. Is it not enough that the Bible
                                is persecuted and prohibited as though it were an emanation from the
                                spirit of evil, that free worship is denied to Christians, and that
                                an illiterate, intolerant, and merciless priesthood, drugged with
                                the refuse of middle-age legends, tyrannize over a peasantry whose
                                condition, under the sway of a woman and a mother, is exemplified by
                                the fact that they share the acorns of the Valencian hills with the
                                swine that are happier than they? Is it not enough that Spain is the
                                barbarous paradox of Europe, and that in her present state her
                                population might almost yearn backwards towards the day of Cid? The
                                Spanish kingdom is a vast, solemn, and mournful ruin, whose very
                                monuments of ancient splendor contrast with the squalid intrigues,
                                the degraded morals, the lost place in Europe, and the famished
                                industry of Spain, in the nineteenth century; but are we to witness,
                                as a climax of this melancholy decay, the breeding of another
                                Spanish race, which shall go forth, as of old, <hi rend="italic">in

                            <p>The board held a special meeting on Thursday, the 8th instant, at the
                                vestry rooms of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue, Bevis Marks;
                                the president <hi rend="italic">pro tem.,</hi> J. M. Montefiore,
                                esq., in the chair.</p>
                            <p>The minutes of the last meeting having been read and confirmed, and
                                the secretary having reported that £200 had, as a first instalment,
                                been despatched to Turkey for the suffering co-religionists by the
                                fire at Monastir,</p>
                            <p>The president explained that the meeting had been convened at an
                                unusually short notice (24 hours) in consequence of a most urgent
                                case detailed in the letter lying on the table. The Spanish original
                                had been addressed to Sir Moses Montefiore, although intended for
                                the board. It had reached the worthy baronet at his country seat,
                                Ramsgate, in the course of the latter holidays; and its contents
                                showing that not a moment was to be lost if the further execution of
                                innocent men was to be prevented, he at once communicated with the
                                Foreign Office, requesting Earl Russell to interpose in behalf of
                                the innocent survivors in Morocco, condemned to death by the Spanish
                                consul, and he had now the satisfaction of announcing that, in a
                                prompt reply from the Foreign Office, Sir Moses was assured that
                                telegrams had at once been forwarded to the proper officials in
                                Morocco energetically to interfere in behalf of the prisoners. The
                                meeting had been convened at the earliest day possible in order to
                                ask it to ratify the steps taken by Sir Moses, and to adopt such
                                additional measures as might be deemed expedient.</p>
                            <p>The secretary then read the translation of the Spanish letter, which
                                was lengthy, and which gave minute details of the atrocities
                                committed and of the fruitless steps taken by the Jewish communities
                                and several consuls in order to induce the Spanish consul to delay
                                the execution of the iniquitous sentence pronounced by him, until
                                his government could be communicated with. The account of the
                                cruelties resorted to by Señor Merry to extract from the prisoners a
                                confession of the crime imputed to them, as well as the terrible and
                                lingering death inflicted on them, extorted from this grave body a
                                cry of horror, and, but for the irrefragable evidence lying before
                                them, they would have been strongly disposed to disbelieve the
                                statements made, as it was scarcely conceivable that the
                                representative of a civilized nation could have indulged in such
                                cruelties.</p>
                            <pb facs="0443" n="419" xml:id="pg_419"/>
                            <p>A vote of thanks was passed to Sir Moses Montefiore for his prompt
                                action. It was further resolved to memorialize the Foreign Office on
                                the barbarities committed on two innocent Jews at Tetuan, at the
                                instigation of the Spanish vice-consul, and which were likewise
                                detailed in the letter alluded to. It having transpired during the
                                meeting that the lives of the two surviving prisoners in Morocco
                                would be spared, in consequence of the representations made by Baron
                                James de Rothschild, of Paris, to the Spanish government, it was
                                resolved, before taking any further steps, to await additional
                                information from Morocco, promised by the writer of the letter
                                referred to. The meeting then separated.</p>
                            <p>We observe that we have omitted the various details given in the
                                letter on the origin of these proceedings, and the means taken by
                                Señor Merry to obtain his object, as we have, in another column,
                                inserted communications addressed to us which give full
                                particulars.</p>
                            <p>All accounts of these atrocities hitherto published by us have
                                reached us through Jewish quarters, which may be suspected of
                                partiality. We will, therefore, insert one emanating from a
                                Christian residing at Mogadore, who gives it as he has heard it,
                                evidently from those to whom the guilt or innocence of the prisoners
                                is a matter of indifference. We may consider his version as that of
                                Señor Merry’s partisans. We will not alter one single word in it.
                                Let our readers judge in how far Señor Merry’s own version justifies
                                his deeds. The Mogadore Christian writes: “A very shocking affair
                                has occurred at Saffi, a town about sixty miles distant, which, if
                                proved to be true, is very discreditable to the Jewish community of
                                this country. The Spaniards have a Spanish collector of customs, and
                                each port receives half-duties on account of the Moorish debt to
                                them. In Saffi the collector was a gentleman about fifty years of
                                age, and lately a colonel in the army. He resided by himself, having
                                a couple of Jewish servants, one a lad of fourteen and the other a
                                woman. It appears, so it is affirmed, that they conspired, with
                                three or four others, to murder and rob him. They gave him arsenic,
                                but as he, not liking the food, ate little of it, and it took no
                                effect, they then gave him corrosive sublimate in some milk
                                puddings, which effectually destroyed him: he died in three or four
                                days. They have been taken on suspicion, and beaten. They then
                                acknowledged and confessed to have been guilty. There are seven in
                                prison—five Jews and two Jewesses. I think the authorities acted
                                wrong in beating them till they confessed, as it is very likely the
                                lash would make them confess to almost anything. The body ought to
                                have been analyzed. They await the decision of the Emperor, at
                                Tangiers. I expect they will be decapitated; but I believe there is
                                a great deal of poisoning carried on in this country.”</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">To the Editor of the Jewish Chronicle:</hi></p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir:</hi> I have further details to hand
                                on the tragedy and outrages at Saffi, Tangier, and Tetuan. I enclose
                                translation of the copy of letter I read to you addressed by Messrs.
                                S. Benhayon and Haim Labos from Tangier to Mr. Judah de Azar
                                Serfaty, Gibraltar, whose hearts bleed at seeing our brethren of
                                Morocco so much exposed to the repetition of scenes so awful and
                                disgraceful. Poor Morocco Jews! their lot is most distressing,
                                inasmuch as they are living in a country where the local government
                                is quite a nullity. The Tetuan congregational committee are cautious
                                how they complain; this, of course, arising from that timidity which
                                is so natural to a people who have no rights to protect them and no
                                laws to apply to for redress whenever they are so very roughly
                                handled. They are now afraid of exciting the resentment of the
                                Spanish representative at Tangier, or that of his subalterns along
                                the coast, as these <pb facs="0444" n="420" xml:id="pg_420"/> have
                                always opportunities to avenge themselves upon individuals. They are
                                invariably acting most arbitrarily in that country, actually
                                trampling upon sovereign rights. It is to be wondered that the
                                representatives of Great Britain and France should show themselves
                                so indifferent, and tolerate gross injustices so revolting to every
                                feeling person. The general opinion, however, is, that if Sir John
                                Drummond Hay, her Britannic Majesty’s minister, had been at Tangier
                                perhaps these awful occurrences might not have taken place; but he
                                was absent.</p>
                            <p>The Sultan is said to be a good and most affable person, and that he
                                loves the Jews; but he is so weak-minded, and dreads war so much,
                                that he cannot evince his sense of justice to the Jews when a
                                foreign consul demands, with or without a cause, their punishment.
                                He is in a most critical position, as it is said, “between the sword
                                and the wall,” especially as he has made it a rule to avoid the
                                least imbroglios with foreign nations, thinking that by this policy
                                he will obviate every possibility of aggressions upon his dominions
                                by European powers. Some of the representatives, as well as their
                                countrymen, whose mischievous propensities blind them, take
                                advantage of this known weakness, and the former and the latter have
                                become so many petty despots, and the evil-disposed never lack
                                opportunities in which they make sad use of the uncontrolled power
                                of their unscrupulous consuls to gratify their resentment by basely
                                avenging the least pretended personal offences, forcing the local
                                government, which is only their tool, to be the executive of their
                                malicious machinations and artful devices. The Moors know nothing of
                                the European machinery of justice, and literature and journalism are
                                quite sealed books to them. This fact led the European powers to
                                stipulate by clauses in their treaties with that empire, investing
                                thereby their consuls with judicial authority in questions wherein
                                their respective subjects might be concerned. But at present the
                                native Jews have no appeal whatever for wrongs endured, nor any
                                claims to fair play. Consequently they are openly trodden down with
                                barefaced impunity by all parties, and their lives, liberty, and
                                possessions are totally disregarded; naturally they live in constant
                                dread. Even those Jews who are protected by consuls are likewise
                                haunted by that fear, lest they should lose that protection by
                                incurring the least displeasure of their protectors.</p>
                            <p>Hence they must adopt every mean artifice, if necessary, in order to
                                ingratiate themselves, and thus obtain protection for their persons,
                                families, and possessions. This frightful state of things, some
                                believe, might be easily removed if proper measures were taken by
                                the board of deputies for the establishment of a competent tribunal,
                                composed of three or more of the consuls, for instance the English,
                                French, and Italian, to take cognizance of important matters
                                affecting the Jews, who would thus be relieved from that timidity
                                which degrades them; and it would be the most efficacious check upon
                                that tyranny and despotism created by the uncontrolled actions of
                                some of the consuls along the coast, when Jews or even Moors are
                                concerned, inasmuch as they are now perfectly irresponsible for the
                                awful consequences arising from that unnatural assumed power so
                                recently displayed, as we see it, in the tragedy of Saffi and
                                Tangier, in which two lives have been sacrificed after enduring
                                torments too harrowing to be detailed; and though dying innocently
                                as they did, what redress can their bereaved and afflicted families
                                obtain? Public opinion, no doubt, will be telling in this case, but
                                it is necessary that the European press should take up the matter,
                                and this will promote the endeavor to place the native Jews under
                                the control of a properly constituted tribunal in cases, at least,
                                where corporal or capital punishments are involved.</p>
                            <p>Yours, truly,</p>

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir and Esteemed Friend:</hi>By your
                                    letter to our friend, Mr. S. Benhayon, we are informed of the
                                    great zeal and warmth with which our countrymen have taken up
                                    the disastrous catastrophe which occurred on the 10th instant.
                                    [It was on the 13th.] Mr. S. Benhayon and myself have written to
                                    M. Cremieux, president of the Universal Israelitish Alliance,
                                    communicating to him all that has taken place. At the same time
                                    we acquaint you with the deeds of the minister of her Catholic
                                    Majesty, Sir Don Francisco Merry y Colon, who, knowing the weak
                                    points of the Moroqueen government, which has latterly succumbed
                                    to the force of arms, and which is smarting painfully from the
                                    payment of the indemnity, bends to everything that is asked for;
                                    and the consul, prompted by his pride, imposes capricious laws
                                    without justice, (and there are facts to prove it.) I shall
                                    speak out without reserve—these are the deeds of the people in
                                    charge of her Catholic Majesty’s legation in this country; hence
                                    he demanded the immolation of those two victims against all law.
                                    The confession of these has been extorted by the rack, calling
                                    to mind the latter part of the 15th century, and resuscitating
                                    Fray Tomas de Torquemada, who has been dead 365 years. There are
                                    rumors to-day in Saffi and here that it is not certain that the
                                    collector died from the effects of poison, but from illness.
                                    There was no post-mortem examination, although two governments’
                                    surgeons were taken there for that purpose; but Señor Merry
                                    would not allow it, alleging that the prisoners had already
                                    confessed. The young man of fourteen years, Jacob Benyudah,
                                    confessed under <hi rend="italic">palos</hi>, (lashes or
                                    cudgelling,) and, as he lacked experience, he caught at the
                                    offers of liberty that were made to him. He made six
                                    declarations, each different from the other. They did not take
                                    his tender age into consideration, but subjected him to a
                                    horrible death, mutilating his body.</p>
                                <p>The other atrocity is their having brought the second supposed
                                    criminal to be executed here, among a population which had not
                                    any complicity in the supposed crime. He confessed under the
                                    following tortures: 1. He suffered with fortitude and patience a
                                    great number of lashes, and without confessing. 2. He was hung
                                    with his head downwards, yet remained firm. 3. He was put into a
                                    box, with the points of nails inside, piercing his body. Under
                                    this infamous and fatal torture he shrieked in desperation, “I
                                    have killed ten, not one.” This was taken as a confession, and
                                    he was sentenced to death. Horror! there must have been thirst
                                    for Hebrew blood.</p>
                                <p>Immediately, and without the loss of a second, after the
                                    unfortunate Elias Beneluz was executed, we took possession,
                                    almost <hi rend="italic">a viva fuerza,</hi> of the body, head,
                                    and blood of our brother, having during the execution
                                    administered the religious consolation of the Shemang. As soon
                                    as Señor Merry knew this he sent a message to the governor,
                                    asking why he allowed the Jews to possess themselves of the
                                    executed so soon, when he ought to have left him cast on the
                                    ground, exposed to the public gaze, for at least two hours. This
                                    is, dear brethren, the clemency and grace to be obtained from
                                    the petrified heart of Señor Merry.</p>
                                <p>To corroborate the deeds of these employés, I shall tell you that
                                    at Tetuan, on the eve of Rosh Hashana, a robbery was committed
                                    in a shop belonging to a Spaniard, in which an old shoe was
                                    found. Señor Fantom, the Spanish vice-consul, repaired to the
                                    governor, demanding the punishment of the thieves. The governor
                                    sent for all Jewish shoemakers. On presenting themselves, he
                                    asked who made the shoe that was found. One replied, “Sir, it is
                                    mine.” The governor dismissed the others and sent this one to
                                    prison. Then the vice-consul accused a young man, a Jew, who was
                                    formerly a servant to the Spaniard. He was produced and sent to
                                    prison. On Wednesday after Rosh Hashana they were taken to the
                                    meshuar, in the presence of the governor, who ordered the man to
                                        <pb facs="0446" n="422" xml:id="pg_422"/> say to whom he had
                                    sold the shoe, since he knew it was his own making. “Sir,” he
                                    answered, “it is impossible for me to bring to recollection to
                                    whom I sold it, as I am an old man, and as I make many every day
                                    and sell them. It is impossible for me.” The governor, not
                                    satisfied with this, nor the vice-consul either, and seeing that
                                    the young man made no confession, shut them up in the meshuar,
                                    and they were punished with the lash. On the report going
                                    abroad, the young man’s father came to implore mercy in behalf
                                    of his son, but the soldiers at the gates opposed his entrance;
                                    and on his insisting, a soldier came up to him with a cudgel,
                                    and with one blow inflicted a severe wound on his head. The
                                    unfortunate man fell senseless to the ground, was thence taken
                                    to the hospital, and is said to be in danger.</p>
                                <p>Hasten, dear brethren, to use without delay, and with ardor, all
                                    the means that your intelligence may suggest. Do not depend on
                                    the gentlemen of this Junta. They do not possess the energy or
                                    unanimity so much required. They are full of dread lest they
                                    should come into collision with one or the other government.
                                    There being no unanimity for any purpose, the spirit evaporates,
                                    the energy. is lost, and the affair dies out.</p>
                                <p>In us the Jewish blood boils, more so when we think of the blood
                                    of our brethren shed. God will help you, dear brethren, and we
                                    trust that the Lord of the universe will help you on in your
                                    good deeds, and from our home we shall pray for your

                                    <p>The first impression produced on our mind by the report of
                                        the proceedings of the board of deputies, and the perusal of
                                        the letter on the same subject, inserted in another column,
                                        is no doubt that which they will make on every one of our
                                        readers. We saw Spain as of old revived—cruel, fanatic, and
                                        panting after the blood of unbelievers. The spirit of the
                                        sanguinary <hi rend="italic">visigoths,</hi> with its fierce
                                        war of extermination against the Jews, strode once more over
                                        the blood-stained soil of the peninsula, and, finding no
                                        longer victims at home, sought them on the coast beyond the
                                        Straits of Gades. It seemed as though Spain’s darling
                                        institution— the inquisition—unable to gratify again the
                                        eyes of the faithful with the pleasing sight of racked and
                                        burnt heretics either in Europe or America, had transferred
                                        its seat to the country of the Moors, and there commissioned
                                        Torquemada Redivivus to renew his atrocities. It seemed all
                                        but impossible to believe that the representative of a power
                                        within a few hours’ sail from his government should have
                                        dared, on his own authority, to torture and butcher persons
                                        accused of a crime for which there is not a tittle of
                                        evidence, save the admission extorted by the rack from the
                                        prisoners, and for the commission of which no reasonable
                                        motive could have existed. Yet, on the other hand, how is it
                                        conceivable to suppose that these crimes against helpless
                                        individuals should have been sanctioned by a goverment which
                                        only four short years ago evinced so much humanity toward
                                        Jewish fugitives from the same coast, who sought, and found,
                                        temporary safety on Spanish ground, and which so efficiently
                                        protected the Jewish inhabitants of Tetuan while the city
                                        was occupied by its troops? By what process of reasoning can
                                        be reconciled the line of conduct pursued by the same
                                        government in releasing from their confinement Spanish
                                        subjects guilty of the crime of having propagated heresy at
                                        home, with that prescribing the extermination <pb

                                        abroad, who never owed allegiance to the Spanish crown?
                                        Would it not be sheer madness, in a great nation just
                                        emerging from an unparalleled state of prostration and
                                        barbarism, the consequence of the terrible crimes of the
                                        past of which it is now conscious, striving hard for its
                                        rehabilitation, and taking again its stand by the side of
                                        Europe’s mightiest states, to rouse the indignation of the
                                        civilized world by misdeeds that might throw doubts on its
                                        resolution to break forever with the ignominious past, and
                                        represent all its modern enlightened institutions as a mere
                                        sham, as a slight varnish intended to conceal the dark
                                        ground-color, and thus to alienate from it that public
                                        opinion which within the last few years began to veer round,
                                        and to believe in the extinction of the race of those
                                        delighting in the shrieks of men and women—ay, of youths and
                                        maidens—expiring in the flames?</p>
                                    <p>In this perplexity of deciding whether the Spanish
                                        representative at Tangier, in enacting the tragedy described
                                        elsewhere, proceeded on his own sole personal
                                        responsibility, without communicating previously with his
                                        government, or turned torturer and murderer by direct orders
                                        of his superiors—there being no <hi rend="italic">tertium
                                            medium</hi>—we prefer the former explanation, presenting
                                        as it does less insuperable difficulties than the second
                                        alternative. Individual fanatics, even in authority, have
                                        unfortunately existed under liberal governments even in
                                        modern times. Some twenty-three years ago the chief agent in
                                        the atrocities then perpetrated on innocent Jews in another
                                        Mahometan city, through the instrumentality of a Mahometan
                                        court of justice, was the representative of enlightened
                                        France. If Damascus had its Ratti-Menton, who, armed with
                                        the power of the mighty nation represented by him, lashed,
                                        racked, and tortured to his heart’s desire, until he
                                        extorted the confession of the murder of a man of whom it
                                        has never been proved that he was murdered, why should not
                                        Tangier be afflicted with a Merry, following in the same
                                        bloody track in order to avenge the death of a man of whom
                                        it has not even been shown that he died by any other means
                                        save the visitation of God? There is a circumstance
                                        inclining us still more to the alternative adopted. The
                                        Spanish government, at the intercession of Baron James de
                                        Rothschild, through its ambassador at Paris, we learn, at
                                        once interposed, ordering the lives of the two prisoners,
                                        still in the power of Señor Merry’s Moroqueen hangman, to be
                                        spared. It is not likely that the Spanish government would
                                        have so quickly complied with the request of the Baron had
                                        the execution of the two murdered prisoners taken place by
                                        the direct order of his superior authorities, as stated by
                                        Señor Merry to his colleagues of Italy, France, and England,
                                        when they urged him to defer the carrying out of the
                                        iniquitous sentence pronounced by him until the ministry
                                        could be communicated with.</p>
                                    <p>But this explanation proposed by us, however plausible, must
                                        remain a conjecture as long as the Spanish government does
                                        not express by an overt act its disapprobation of the
                                        proceedings taken by its representative, washing its hands
                                        publicly of the innocent blood shed by him, and which cries
                                        up for vengeance from the ground which has opened its mouth
                                        to receive it. If the Spanish government wishes to clear
                                        itself from the very suspicion of having in any way
                                        participated in this terrible crime—if it wishes
                                        convincingly to prove that the order to spare the lives of
                                        the two survivors, still in prison, is not the consequence
                                        of second thought, of a vague dread of Europe’s public
                                        opinion horrified at such deeds, reminding of the darkest
                                        century of the dark middle ages—it cannot allow matters to
                                        rest where they are; it cannot, for its own credit, but
                                        institute a rigid inquiry into the proceedings taken by its
                                        representative, and cannot but preliminarily remove him from
                                        a post which he has so sadly disgraced, for which he has
                                        proved himself so wofully incompetent, and which, if he be
                                        permitted to retain, would unfortunately offer to him such a
                                        vast field for other outbursts of his fierce fanaticism.
                                        These are matters of the utmost gravity, deserving the
                                        earnest consideration of the Spanish government. But the
                                        families of the victims of its representative have also a
                                        duty to perform. They are most concerned by <pb facs="0448"
                                            n="424" xml:id="pg_424"/> the crime committed; they are
                                        the chief sufferers. They are, therefore, primarily called
                                        upon to vindicate the cause of justice, to protect their
                                        community from similar atrocities, and to obtain for
                                        themselves compensation, in as far as pecuniary compensation
                                        can atone for the terrible wrong inflicted.</p>
                                    <p>Señor Merry is a Spaniard, and as such amenable to the law of
                                        his country. We are not acquainted with this law. But as the
                                        country of a civilized nation, claiming kindred with the
                                        civilized nations of the earth, it must be governed by a
                                        code which offers the innocently persecuted legal means to
                                        call the wrong-doer to an account, and to obtain redress for
                                        just grievances. Surely the Spanish law cannot permit a man
                                        to be charged with poisoning when there is no proof that
                                        anybody has been poisoned. Surely the Spanish law does not
                                        permit a prisoner to be tortured, in order to extort a
                                        confession; nor can it receive such a confession as
                                        evidence, and still less inflict capital punishment on such
                                        evidence. All this, however, Señor Merry has done. His own
                                        will has been a law to him, for he has set aside both the
                                        procedure of the country in which he is, and of that which
                                        he represents. Surely the circumstance that these atrocities
                                        were not enacted on Spanish soil cannot insure to him
                                        impunity, and still less so the fact that he commissioned
                                        Moroqueens, and not Spaniards, with the perpetration of the
                                        crime. Spain has a law, and by this he must be judged. Our
                                        earnest advice, therefore, to the families of the victims is
                                        to appeal to the law. This may be expensive; but the
                                        congregation of Tangier offered to pay to the Spanish consul
                                        any sum he might ask as a ransom for the lives of the two
                                        murdered persons. Let the sum which the congregation was
                                        ready to pay as a ransom be employed in the legal
                                        proceedings which we advise. And if an appeal by the
                                        families of the victims were made to Europe, we have no
                                        doubt but it would be responded to. The necessary funds for
                                        defraying the cost of the trial would be forthcoming, and
                                        contributions might even be expected from liberal-minded
                                        Spaniards. We should not be afraid of the issue of such a
                                        trial. We have full confidence in the sense of justice of
                                        the Spanish tribunals, which would thus have an opportunity
                                        afforded for vindicating the national character, and wiping
                                        out the blot with which the lawless proceedings of the
                                        representative of the country has stained it.</p>
                                    <p>But even if, contrary to all expectations, the course of
                                        justice should be obstructed, the criminal protected, and
                                        the innocent condemned, the attempt at seeking redress would
                                        not be without advantage; for there is a tribunal higher
                                        than any court of justice, which can neither be blinded by
                                        corruption, intimidated by dictates of tyranny, nor misled
                                        by the sophisms of special pleadings. This tribunal is the
                                        supreme court of public opinion, which, heedless of any
                                        other sentence, would decide that a man who in the second
                                        half of the nineteenth century accuses before it has been
                                        proved that a crime was committed, tortures in order to
                                        extort a confession of guilt, condemns on such evidence, and
                                        at last kills in virtue thereof, is, in the eyes of God and
                                        the laws of all civilized nations, worse than he that should
                                        waylay his victim, pounce upon and assassinate him. No
                                        amount of evidence brought forward after the deed could
                                        justify the deed itself, since every man must be held as
                                        innocent until he has been proved guilty by the laws of the
                                        country which judge him; and no amount of evidence brought
                                        forward after the deed would be free from the grave and
                                        well-founded suspicion of having been moulded, twisted, and
                                        perverted, if not devised for the very purpose of justifying
                                        the crime. The verdict of public opinion, therefore, could
                                        not be doubted. Such a trial, whatever its issue, would
                                        further serve as a check upon the lawless proceedings of
                                        unprincipled Europeans, in authority or not, who we are
                                        assured, as matters now stand on the coast of Morocco, but
                                        too often work on the fears of the Moors, using them as
                                        tools, in order to lord it, for purposes of their own, over
                                        the unfortunate Jews. These Europeans would find that,
                                        although not amenable to the laws of Morocco, they can yet
                                        be reached by those of their own country, and the wholesome
                                        dread that it might not <pb facs="0449" n="425"

                                        country to throw over lawless men the mantle of her
                                        protection would not lose its effect.</p>
                                    <p>In whichever aspect, therefore, we regard the counsel which
                                        we tender our Moroqueen brethren, we cannot but earnestly
                                        urge it on their attention. Their own government would have
                                        no reason to prevent them from pursuing a course which their
                                        own safety requires, which liberal Europe would applaud, and
                                        in which they might look forward to the energetic support of
                                        all friends of justice, and of all enemies of fanaticism, be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your despatch, No. 9, dated 14th November last, and, in
                            pursuance of instructions therein contained, I informed the Moorish
                            minister for foreign affairs that the President was entirely satisfied
                            with the royal order issued, in the name of his Majesty the Sultan,
                            relative to vessels of the insurgents visiting the ports of Morocco. As
                            soon as the royal order reached the bashaws of the ports, they at once
                            informed our vice-consuls that, should the occasion require it, they
                            would be ready and willing to carry the order into effect.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch, No. 10, dated December 9, last, with enclosures, reached
                            me on the 7th instant. Before it came to hand, Sir Moses Montefiore,
                            baronet, of London, had, with the sanction of Earl Russell, it is said,
                            visited Madrid, and obtained from the minister for foreign affairs
                            instructions to the Spanish minister in this city to demand from the
                            Sultan the immediate liberation of the two unfortunate Jews who were
                            implicated with the two Jews so barbarously executed for the supposed
                            poisoning of the receiver at Saffi, and, I am glad to say, his Majesty
                            has set them at liberty. Sir Moses visited Tangier, and after remaining
                            here ten days went to Gibraltar, at which place he embarked on one of
                            her Britannic Majesty’s frigates for Mogadore, en route to Morocco city,
                            to have an interview with the Sultan on the condition of the Jews in the
                            empire. T. F. Reade, esq., her Britannic Majesty’s consul in this city,
                            accompanied him as interpreter. I beg to enclose a printed copy of the
                            instructions given by her Catholic Majesty’s government to her Catholic
                            Majesty’s minister and consuls in this country in reference to the
                            future treatment of the Jews in this country. Her Britannic Majesty’s
                            minister, and the Italian and Portuguese consuls general have also
                            received instructions from their governments of a like character.</p>
                        <p>Whether the Jews apprehended a general crusade against themselves on
                            account of their religion, or acts of injustice from any other cause,
                            after the horrible occurrence which took place at Saffi, resulting in
                            the execution of two of their race, without the least shadow of proof of
                            guilt or that a crime had been committed, they were clearly justified,
                            in my opinion, in appealing to the liberal nations of Europe, and to our
                            own, for an amelioration of their unfortunate condition in this country.
                            In view of all the circumstances connected with the late occurrence at
                            Saffi, and upon the authority of your instructions, at the same time
                            exercising the greatest care for the just rights of all concerned, I
                            believe it to be my duty, in the name of humanity, to exert my influence
                            with his Majesty’s government to prevent any injustice to this race.</p>
                        <p>Your circular, No. 43, dated 28th November last, has been received.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient
                            servant,</p>

                            <head>The mission of Sir Moses Montefiore.</head>
                            <p>Sir Moses Montefiore, who has been staying for some few days in
                                Gibraltar, is about to proceed to Saffi, one of the ports of western
                                Barbary, whence he will travel into the interior to have an
                                interview with the Sultan. We subjoin an extract from a circular
                                addressed by the Spanish minister to the consular agents of his
                                government in Morocco, which shows that Sir Moses Montefiore has
                                been completely successful in his mission. The execution of two
                                Jews, and the condemnation to death of two others, in connexion with
                                the death of the Spanish collector at Saffi, was the cause of Sir
                                Moses Montefiore’s journey to this quarter of the world. The Spanish
                                authorities believed that the collector was designedly poisoned; the
                                Jewish population of Barbary was firmly convinced that his death was
                                the result of natural causes, and in the subsequent proceedings,
                                which it is not necessary again to detail, the Jews of Morocco saw
                                only a persecution of their race. They therefore appealed earnestly
                                for help to their co-religionaries in Europe. It will be seen that
                                the Spanish government indignantly repudiate the notion that the
                                action of their authorities in this matter was prompted by a feeling
                                of hostility towards the Jews in Morocco, and they denounce as
                                calumnious everything which has been written in that belief. We
                                stated on a former occasion that the prevailing impression on the
                                minds of the Jews, that they were the objects of systematic
                                persecution, was no doubt a mistaken one, and we are glad to see
                                that the Spanish government have now taken the best and most
                                effectual means of removing the erroneous opinion by enjoining their
                                consuls and vice consuls in Morocco to use their influence for the
                                defence and protection of the Jews against cruelty and injustice
                                from the Moorish authorities.</p>
                            <p>The object which Sir Mosès Montefiore hopes to accomplish by his
                                personal visit to the Sultan is, doubtless, to obtain some
                                improvement in the social <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of the
                                Morocco Jews. The fact that his humane mission is supported by the
                                governments of Christian Europe will, no doubt, powerfully
                                contribute to its success. Every one who desires to see a good cause
                                prosper must sympathize with Sir Moses Montefiore in his generous
                                and self-sacrificing endeavors to benefit his fellow-creatures, and
                                must heartily wish that he may safely pass through the fatigues and
                                perils of a land journey in Barbary in mid-winter, which he is about
                                to encounter at an advanced age, and return to England with the
                                satisfaction of having perfectly succeeded in the object which drew
                                him from his country.</p>

                            <p>“The government of her Majesty the Queen has seen with great
                                displeasure the gross calumnies which have been written against
                                Spain, in the belief that the Spanish consuls in Morocco have
                                undertaken a crusade against the Israelites established in this
                                empire.</p>

                                ought they to cause the agents of Spain to alter their course of
                                proceeding respecting the Hebrews in Morocco, or to cease supporting
                                and protecting them.</p>
                            <p>“On the contrary, the best mode of replying successfully to such
                                calumnies is by increasing your solicitude for this race, which is
                                so sadly circumstanced in this country.</p>
                            <p>“Thus you will avail yourself of every occasion which may arise to
                                prevent acts of cruelty on the part of the Moorish authorities
                                against the Hebrews, and also in cases of notorious injustice, and,
                                when it is in question to inflict the punishment of the lash, you
                                will resolutely interpose your influence with the local authorities
                                to prevent the commission of such acts of barbarity.”</p>
                            <p>The executive committee of the Jewish congregations in Tangier desire

                                the Jews in Morocco:</p>
                            <p>“We, the executive committee of the Jewish congregations at Tangier,
                                having accompanied our honored and venerable patriot, Sir Moses
                                Montefiore, baronet, to Gibraltar, are unwilling to lose the
                                opportunity of giving a public expression to our thanks, and of
                                recording our conviction that his visit to the empire of Morocco has
                                already been productive of a most important influence, and that
                                there is much reason to hope that great and permanent benefit to our
                                co-religionists in that part of Africa will result from it.</p>
                            <p>“Leaving home with the cordial support and countenance of the
                                government of her Majesty the Queen of England, Sir Moses Montefiore
                                had the gratification of a gracious reception from the Queen of
                                Spain and from many of the highest personages of her court. The many
                                distinguished introductions with which he was furnished were
                                powerfully seconded by the conciliatory character of his own
                                personal influence. Hence the object of his mission, for which we
                                are deeply indebted to the board of deputies of the Jews in England,
                                not merely obtained the prompt and warm support of the English
                                minister, our proved friend his excellency Sir J. Hay Drummond Hay,
                                K. C. B, but also that of the other representatives of foreign
                                powers, amongst whom the Spanish minister, his excellency Don F.
                                Merry y Colon, must be specially named, as, by direction of his
                                government, he promptly circulated to his subordinates, the Spanish
                                consuls and vice-consuls in Morocco, a code of instructions
                                admirably calculated to secure our brethren from any repetition of
                                the unfortunate occurrences which have recently inflicted upon them
                                so much suffering and alarm. The influence of the representatives of
                                the other foreign powers will likewise be cordially employed for the
                                same purpose. The good will of our Sultan, already felt to be in our
                                favor, cannot fail to be strengthened and secured by the visit which
                                our venerable champion is on the point of paying to the court of
                                Morocco, where he will have the company and support of our friend
                                the British consul, T. F. Reade, esq.</p>
                            <p>“We think it needless to enter into further details respecting Sir
                                Moses Montefiore’s movements, of which, in due time, an official
                                report will appear; yet it would not be doing justice to him or to
                                our feelings were we to omit to state that, besides making various
                                munificent donations of a charitable character, in which the poor of
                                all classes and sects in Tangier participated, he took a most
                                important step for the promotion of female education by inducing’
                                the principal Israelite ladies in that city to institute and
                                themselves superintend a school for the poor girls of our community,
                                bestowing the generous gift of £300 to secure the speedy
                                commencement of this most desirable undertaking, and to connect with
                                it the memory of his late lamented wife, the amiable and excellent
                                Lady Judith Montefiore.</p>
                            <p>“May the Almighty still lengthen out the days of our honored friend
                                and benefactor, preserving him to his country and to his brethren of
                                the family of Israel, and bestowing his choicest blessings upon
                                him.”</p>

                            Sultan to all the foreign nations represented in Morocco, in reference
                            to a light-house, erected by his Majesty’s order, on Cape Spartel, at
                            the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic; and also the
                            form of the regulations for the control and administration of the same,
                            (see enclosures Nos. 1, 2.) The utility of this structure cannot be
                            denied, nor its value to the commercial interests of all nations trading
                            in the Mediterranean estimated; and it is to be hoped, through its
                            agency, we will hear no more of shipwreck and loss of life and property
                            on that part of the African coast upon which it is situated. But as this
                            is not a maritime nation, and in fact has only a comparatively small
                            commercial interest with the nations of Europe, and I may say none with
                            America, his Majesty the Sultan desires, upon its completion, that his
                            expenditure on its account should cease; and, therefore, he proposes to
                            all the foreign powers represented in Tangier to enter into a treaty
                            with each, or as many as may be willing, to place the control and
                            administration of the light-house in the hands of those nations
                            authorizing their representatives to sign said treaty, and the signing
                            powers each on their part to contribute annually, in advance, their
                            proportionate share of the expenses incident thereto; such share to be
                            determined in the ratio of their respective commercial interests in the
                            Mediterranean and on the coast of Morocco. It will be seen that the
                            minister for Spain offers a substitute for the first article proposed by
                            the Sultan. With the exception of the substitute offered, it will be
                            understood by the department the forms of the proposed treaty and
                            regulations meet the general but unofficial approval of the entire
                            diplomatic corps.</p>
                        <p>That functionary has also proposed that each signing power shall pay an
                            equal sum toward defraying the expenses of illuminating the light-house,
                            instead of each paying in the ratio of their respective interests as
                            above named. On the latter basis Spain would rate third, or perhaps
                            fourth, in the scale of commercial interests.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen from the proposed regulations that 15,000 francs at most
                            is the estimated expense per annum of illuminating, &amp;c., the
                            light-house.</p>
                        <p>There are twelve nations represented in this country, and it cannot be
                            supposed for a moment that all will contribute to this purpose. My own
                            opinion is, that Great Britain, France, and Italy will at once consent,
                            and Spain will also, but only upon the condition that the substitute
                            offered by their official will be accepted by his Majesty the Sultan and
                            the signing powers The first article proposed by the Sultan prohibits a
                            cession of the light-house to any power. This will be objectionable to
                            Spain, as it conflicts with her dreams of conquest on this coast; and
                            besides, the signing powers will be bound by the same article to
                            guarantee “<hi rend="italic">au Sultan l’integrite territoriale et la
                                propriete du phare;”</hi> and to such an arrangement Spain will not,
                            in my opinion, agree.</p>
                        <p>The enclosures were drawn up by the chargé d’affaires <hi rend="italic"
                                >ad interim</hi> of France, and with the approval of M. Bargash,
                            Moorish minister for foreign affairs, and I have taken the liberty to
                            transmit them in the same language in which I received them, retaining,
                            however, a copy for the use of the consulate, for I deemed it of too
                            much importance to trust any translation that I could furnish.</p>
                        <p>I confess myself unable to discover upon what principle my government,
                            having no commercial interest in this country, ought to contribute to
                            the perpetual maintenance of a light-house on this coast any more than
                            the South American republics and other nations that have no trade with
                            Morocco.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that on the
                            17th instant I received a confidential communication from the United
                            States consul at Gibraltar, informing me information had come to his
                            knowledge which had led him to suppose <pb facs="0455" n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431"/> that Mr. R. O. Joyce, a merchant in that city, who
                            acted as the pretended agent of the rebel steamer Sumter while in that
                            port, intended to send to Mogadore the five guns which were taken out of
                            the Sumter and stored in a hulk in that bay. The consul could not
                            ascertain on whose account Mr. Joyce intended to transship the guns to
                            Mogadore.</p>
                        <p>I at once called on the acting Moorish minister for foreign affairs, and
                            informed him I had learned the five guns formerly on board the rebel
                            steamer Sumter, but now lying in a hulk in the bay of Gibraltar, were
                            about to be sent to Mogadore, but on whose account I could not learn,
                            and inquired of him if an agent of his Majesty the Sultan had bought
                            them on government account. The minister replied that he knew nothing
                            about the transaction, but would write at once to the Moorish consul at
                            Gibraltar, and ascertain if the guns had been bought for the Sultan. I
                            then informed him the guns were, in fact, the property of the United
                            States; and while we could not object to the purchase of guns by the
                            Sultan from rightful owners, yet, with reference to these particular
                            guns, I wished to inform him, as soon as they were landed on the coast
                            of Morocco, I would demand their lawful seizure as the property of my
                            government, and if this information was communicated to the Moorish
                            consul he might prevent their shipment. On the 20th instant the minister
                            informed me he had just received information from the Moorish consul
                            that an English merchant had offered to sell him the guns on account of
                            the Sultan, to be delivered in Mogadore, but since a difficulty was
                            apprehended from the purchase and shipment, he would neither buy nor
                            permit them to be sent to the coast of Morocco. My opinion is, the
                            consul had bought them for the Sultan.</p>
                        <p>The Koran prohibits the “true believers” from effecting an insurance on
                            any articles shipped by them. To avoid this prohibition, the Sultan
                            purchases on the condition of the delivery of the article on the coast
                            of Morocco. The pretended agent had in a very quiet manner offered to
                            pay $100 to the master of a vessel if he would deliver the guns in
                            Mogadore. This leads me to believe they had been bought by the consul. I
                            presume the English government would not have interposed any objection
                            to the sale of the guns, and their shipment to Mogadore on account of
                            the Sultan, if Mr. Joyce had given bond for the delivery of them to the
                            authorities of the Sultan at that port. It is not probable a private
                            individual could succeed in getting the guns away from Gibraltar, or
                            that they will again be used for destructive purposes by the rebels; and
                            any other than this government would not buy them. While lying in the
                            hulk in Gibraltar bay they cannot be of any benefit to the rebels,
                            neither can they be used to our injury; but if sold, the consideration
                            would be directed into a channel which might, in all probability, injure
                            the government, and materially benefit the rebels. Wherefore, I believed
                            it to be my duty to prevent the sale of them to this government.</p>

                            the department a copy of the translation of a note from the Moorish

                            has removed the restrictions imposed on trade in the interior markets of
                            this country. By an agreement between the Sultan and foreign
                            representatives in this country, communicated to the department in my

                            19th November, 1862, merchants were prohibited from going to markets in
                            the interior to buy wool and cereals, but were permitted to purchase <hi
                                rend="italic">only</hi> in the markets of seaport towns. This
                            restrictive agreement paralyzed trade, and operated greatly to the
                            prejudice of Christian merchants, and at the request of the foreign
                            representatives the agreement has been rescinded, and no restrictions

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to inform you that the
                            light-house constructed by order of his Majesty the Sultan on Cape
                            Spartel, at the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic
                            ocean, will be illuminated on the 30th day of the present month, or the
                            31st day of October. For location, description, &amp;c., see enclosure
                            No. 1. The agents of foreign powers residing here agreed, on the 1st
                            instant, to illuminate the light-house on the 30th instant, but inasmuch
                            as the Moorish minister is unable to give me sixty days’ notice in
                            advance of illuminating the same, as required by me in a note to him
                            under date of the 4th of Feb* ruary last, by reason of the action of
                            those agents fixing a shorter time, I gave him notice of a formal
                            protest for all damages which might occur to our ship ping on the coast
                            of Morocco within the period of sixty days from the 1st instant, arising
                            from the illumination of said light-house, and of which light our
                            masters of vessels would be ignorant, in consequence of the shortness of
                            the notice. The time is sufficient for all the European governments,
                            because of their nearness to this country, but, as I informed the
                            Moorish minister last February, I required sixty days’ notice, because
                            of our great distance from this country and the length of time it would
                            require me to inform my government of the establishment of said light.
                            Some time since the majority of my colleagues gave to their governments
                            what they call a preliminary notice, “that the light would be fixed
                            during the month of September.” I received no such notice, neither from
                            them nor the Moorish minister, and I am informed by the consul general
                            of <pb facs="0457" n="433" xml:id="pg_433"/> Sweden that he received no
                            such notice, and we, above all others, should have had ample notice,
                            because our governments are further off than any others taking part in
                            the maintenance of the light. Upon learning from the Moorish minister
                            the difficulty he was in with respect to my demand, some of my
                            colleagues, and particularly the ministers of France, England, and
                            Spain, have written to their governments, informing them that I had
                            heretofore required of this government sixty days’ notice, and from the
                            fact that preliminary notices had been published in their respective
                            countries that the light would be fixed during the month of September,
                            they had named the last day of the month for illuminating, in pursuance
                            of the preliminary notice before given, but, if instructed by their
                            governments, they would not illuminate until the 31st day of October,
                            which would, as they claim, but I deny, be equivalent to sixty days’
                            notice to me from the Moorish minister. Wherefore, I am compelled to
                            give the notice to the department in a conditional form, in order that
                            notice, by publication, (if such be the rule of the department,) may be
                            given at the earliest moment. My reason for requiring sixty days’ notice
                            from this government will become apparent to the department when it is
                            considered that, from the peculiar location of the Cape Spartel light,
                            it might unsuspectingly be taken, by masters of vessels approaching the
                            western entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic, for the
                            Cape Trafalgar light, on the coast of Spain, and masters would, in the
                            absence of notice of the existence of the Cape Spartel light, bear south
                            with their vessels, at the time believing that the Cape Spartel light
                            was the Trafalgar light, and the result would inevitably be destruction
                            of life and property on the Morocco coast. Hence I believed duty
                            required me in the interest of navigation to demand ample notice, so
                            that the department could give all interested due notice of the light on
                            Cape Spartel. If any damage shall be done to our shipping within sixty
                            days by reason of said light, I will make formal protest against this
                            government, and leave the department, after being fully informed
                            thereof, to determine what further steps shall be taken. In a legal
                            point of view, the foreign agents, although instructed to take part in
                            the control, &amp;c., of the light-house, have no right to fix the time
                            of illuminating the same, without first obtaining the consent of the
                            Moorish government, and this they did not get, or, at least, on the 18th
                            instant the Moorish minister informed them he could not consent to the
                            30th of September, because he wished to give me sixty days’ notice. The
                            Sultan now proposes a new article to the treaty, which will give him the
                            right to levy light-house dues on all ships visiting his ports, but, at
                            the same time, each signing power is asked to pay a fixed sum annually
                            for keeping up the light. We have intimated to the Moorish minister that
                            we will not agree to double duties. He will shortly visit the Sultan to
                            confer with him on this subject. The greater part of my colleagues will
                            also visit the Sultan within a month, as they are required by their
                            governments to go to the court at least once in each year. I think some
                            time will elapse before we will all be ready to arrange definitely the
                            form of the treaty; where there are so many parties to consult, delays
                            must necessarily occur. A part of my colleagues who have been authorized
                            to take part in the control of the light-house have received from their
                            governments letters plenipotentiary; and others, being at first
                            authorized in the same manner that I have been by your despatch, No. 12,
                            dated 27th June last, have written to their governments for full powers
                            also, to put them on an equality in this respect with the agents of
                            France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal. I submit to the department whether
                            it would not, in view of the fact that all of my colleagues will receive
                            full powers, be as well for me to be in possession of the same from my
                            government. Her Britannic Majesty’s minister resident received
                            instructions of the tenor of my own, but has written to his government
                            for “letters patent,” in order that he may be on a perfect equality with
                            others. In my opinion an agreement simply would have been quite
                            sufficient between this government <pb facs="0458" n="434"
                                xml:id="pg_434"/> and the several powers taking part, but it appears
                            that the minister for France has been required to take a more formal
                            step, and other agents are willing to follow the example.</p>

                            dated September 2, I now have the honor to inform you that the minister
                            for France this day invited the agents of Christian powers to his hotel,
                            and informed them that his government could see no reason why the
                            light-house was not illuminated on the 30th ultimo, and instructed the
                            minister to confer with his colleagues and arrange with them to
                            illuminate at an earlier day than the 31st of this month. The minister
                            suggested the 15th instant, which was agreed to by the agents of nine
                            powers. To this I dissented. The light-house will be illuminated on the
                            15th current, and before this despatch reaches you. Ten powers, I am
                            informed, have instructed their agents to take part in the control and
                            maintenance of the light.</p>

                            interest continues to be manifested here in the civil war of America.
                            This interest has been especially shown by commercial people with a view
                            to the direction of their business.</p>
                        <p>The Arabic (official) journal gives a weekly summary of American news,
                            with liberal comments. And I am credibly informed that a memorial has
                            been drawn up, and is in circulation for signatures among the Moorish
                            nobility, addressed to the President of the United States, against
                            African slavery, and in favor of universal justice and humanity.</p>
                        <p>At the request of an American and English party and of the minister of
                            foreign affairs, I recently (unofficially) placed before the Tunisian
                            government propositions for the construction of a railroad from Tunis to
                            the Goletta. The project has, however, failed, according to present
                            appearances.</p>
                        <p>Many applications have been made to me for information and aid by young
                            men, principally Italians, professing a desire to join our army.</p>
                        <p>A merchant informs me that our recent victories have already caused a

                            following morning, there were nine shocks of an earthquake in this city,
                            accompanied by a heavy rumbling noise; the first and last shocks were
                            far the heaviest. No great damage was done, but at the time and during
                            the following week great consternation prevailed. Thousands of people
                            left the city in carriages and on foot, filling the villages around,
                            encamping in the open fields, and some few departing by sea for the
                            towns and villages along the shore. The only material result of all this
                            stir is, so far as I can learn, the appearance of an island in the
                            Mediterranean, the discovery of which is announced in the enclosed
                            despatch from our vice-consul at the Goletta.</p>

                            <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Consul General</hi>:</p>
                            <p>Captain Mohammed Aoun, of the Tunisian brig Wansow, having arrived at
                                Leghorn, has announced to me the discovery of an island some 125
                                yards in length, situated in longitude 8.30 east, and in latitude
                                37.50 north, exactly on the Clerki reefs. I fulfil the duty of
                                making known to you this discovery. The movements of the earth, of
                                which we have experienced strong shocks at Tunis, may have
                                occasioned that volcanic eruption. I do not doubt that the captain
                                states a fact, the importance of which may be great both for science
                                and navigation; particularly if the new island produced from the
                                Clerki reefs by volcanic pressure remains permanent.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to report, that while no
                            very important events have of late occurred in this regency, many
                            circumstances indicate the favorable tendency of public sentiment in
                            regard to our country. All the consuls here, with one exception, (the
                            British,) have uniformly manifested a desire for the success of our
                            nation. The French consul and the French subordinate officials and
                            merchants, whose acquaintance I enjoy, take the liberal journals of
                            France, such as the Sieclé and the Debats, and partake of their liberal
                            and friendly sentiments.</p>
                        <p>A few weeks since the French consul, then just returned from Paris with
                            his appointment as minister to Japan, gave as a sentiment at a parting
                            dinner, where were present all his subordinate officers and myself, as
                            the only consular guest of Tunis, “Union and liberty in America as well
                            as in France.” He remarked <pb facs="0461" n="437" xml:id="pg_437"/>
                            that he knew this sentiment to be favored by the Emperor, on the ground
                            both of humanity and of national policy. At his request I gave him a
                            letter to our minister in Japan, embodying his friendly expression in
                            the letter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to forward to your
                            excellency by this mail a printed copy of a convention recently
                            concluded between the British government and that of the Bey of Tunis.
                            This treaty appears on its face and is claimed by its friends to be a
                            mutual concession of rights and privileges, tending to do away with
                            indirect legal processes, at present much resorted to by foreigners; to
                            diminish political differences between Tunisians and foreigners; and to
                            give aid and countenance to the cause of civilization and constitutional
                            government. By this treaty the Bey permits British subjects to hold real
                            estate in their own name, on the condition that their real estate be
                            subjected to the laws of the country in regard to registration and
                            taxation.</p>
                        <p>The provisions of this treaty are at the present time the subject of much
                            animated and bitter discussion, in which British and Tunisian
                            authorities appear prominent on one side, and French and Italian on the
                            other side. The principal arguments urged in favor of this convention
                            are, that its provisions are just and reasonable, promoting the
                            interests of both parties; that its guarantees of good faith and fair
                            dealing on the part of the Moorish government are ample, the consul
                            alone having the power to execute the decrees and decisions of the local
                            authorities; and, finally, that his convention provides the only way in
                            which foreigners can become <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> real estate
                            holders, identifying themselves with the interests of the country. The
                            main argument urged against the convention is, that the right to tax and
                            control the property of foreigners cannot be safely given up to
                            Mussulmen. The natives of this country are represented to be yet too
                            rude and barbarous for such a trust and responsibility. Ignorance,
                            superstition, and fanaticism are represented to be so prevalent that
                            this convention, however good its object, must prove a serious evil,
                            retarding instead of promoting the cause of civilization. But there are
                            persons of high official standing in Tunis who attribute to the English
                            government still other motives and considerations. This convention is
                            represented to be a political contrivance designed to gain a controlling
                            influence, or, at least, to prevent France from controlling or getting
                            possession of this regency. England has here some ten thousand Maltese
                            subjects, many of whom hold real estate <hi rend="italic"
                                >indirectly,</hi> and, with the signing of this treaty, soon become
                                <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> real estate holders, thus giving
                            England a direct interest in the soil and institutions of Tunis, which
                            no other nation at present possesses.</p>
                        <p>The consuls general of Spain and Austria are understood to favor the
                            principles embodied in this treaty, and to give encouragement of the
                            speedy adoption of the same by their respective governments. The general
                            policy of England and America, in this country, has for many years been
                            supposed to be the same, on which account the British consul general
                            makes a special appeal for our countenance and encouragement. As yet I
                            have taken no decided stand for or against the treaty, thinking it more
                            prudent to await some unbiased expression from my government. I may say
                            that I do not see how any harm could possibly <pb facs="0462" n="438"
                                xml:id="pg_438"/> happen to us from the adoption of this treaty, and
                            I do see how much harm may be prevented by checkmating France, and
                            encouraging the independent action of the Tunisian government. I hereby
                            enclose Articles XI and XII of the municipal regulations referred to in
                            the Article XI of the convention.</p>

                                improvement it be judged expedient to widen a street which is narrow
                                and inconvenient, and this widening depends on a private property,
                                the president of the council shall inform the owner of the private
                                property what part of his estate the city will have to appropriate
                                for the execution of the said measure, and upon notice being given
                                to the consul of the said proprietor the president shall make offers
                                for the purchase of the property. In case the proprietor should
                                consent to the sale, the president should stipulate the conditions
                                of it. If the proprietor refuses to sell, or if he demand an
                                exorbitant price, the property shall be appraised and assessed
                                without injury to the interests of the proprietor, and as the only
                                means of effecting the object in question. The price agreed on by
                                the assessors shall be paid to the proprietor. This measure is
                                required by public interest, to which private interest must yield;
                                but it will not be enforced until after it has been submitted in a
                                clear and precise manner for our approbation, and until we have
                                assented to it. The appraisal of the property shall be made by four
                                amins, (skilled inhabitants of the country,) four experienced
                                appraisers, and four notables of the city, in such way that one
                                cannot doubt that the amount agreed upon is more than the real
                                value. Six of these twelve appraisers will be named by the council,
                                and the other six by the proprietor. In case they agree, they shall
                                execute their decision or that of the majority; but in case of a
                                division of opinion, they shall refer to the Sheik El Kady, and his
                                decision shall be executed.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> XII. If the council should decide
                                to purchase a piece of land for public use, and only a part of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to report that a
                            decoration has been recently received from the Czar of Russia and
                            presented to the Bey of Tunis with much ceremony by the Russian chargé
                            d’affaires. Within the last three years presents have been made to the
                            Bey by the principal European sovereigns, including those of France,
                            England, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Prussia, Sweden,
                            Austria, and Russia, and visits have been made to the Bey within this
                            period by some member of the royal houses of France, England, <pb
                                facs="0463" n="439" xml:id="pg_439"/> Belgium, Prussia, and Italy.
                            Some of the decorations given are said to be such as are alone exchanged
                            between independent sovereigns, and their diplomatic bearings are
                            supposed to be duly considered. Many of these presents have been brought
                            here by governmental steamships, and returns haev been made to all but
                            two of the above-named courts by special envoys of the Bey.</p>
                        <p>A recurrence to some historical facts may, perhaps, throw light upon the
                            actual status and relations of the Tunisian government. Without
                            specifying many events that tended to diminish the friendly and intimate
                            relations between the Tunisian and Ottoman governments, and to establish
                            the independence of the former power, we particularly note the fact that
                            the Ottoman Porte was finally prevented from attempting to interfere in
                            Tunisian affairs by the presence of a French fleet in the harbors of
                            Tunis. Since the above demonstration of French power and assertion of
                            Tunisian independence, no claims or obligations other than of a
                            religious nature have, I am assured, been either urged or acknowledged
                            by either party. So far as Turkey is concerned, Tunis is now, and has
                            been for some time past, politically independent. The Bey acknowledges
                            alone the religious superiority of the Sultan. On these points there
                            appears to be no difference of opinion among those who are supposed to
                            be well informed. Should the Sultan visit Tunis soon, according to
                            newspaper announcements, he would, I am assured, be enthusiastically
                            received as the great hierarch of Moslemism, while as a political
                            sovereign he would find few friends in Tunis.</p>
                        <p>But the means finally employed to prevent Ottoman interference in
                            Tunisian affairs, though effectual, tended to a result unfavorable to
                            Tunisian independence. While protecting the Bey from the Sultan, the
                            French could not neglect such an opportunity to establish their
                            influence and promote their interests in this regency. With an ever
                            present power they were profuse in their professions of good will,
                            giving decorations to the Bey and his chief ministers, and sending
                            Prince Napoleon and other distinguished envoys to honor the Tunisian
                            court.</p>
                        <p>But the Bey, while courteously receiving these attentions, was not blind
                            to his true interests, showing no more partiality for the French eagle
                            than he had before shown for the Ottoman crescent. His foreign affairs
                            have been conducted, unlike those of the home department, with dignity
                            and discretion. While maintaining amicable relations with France and
                            Turkey, he has succeeded in establishing relations no less cordial and
                            confidential with numerous other nations.</p>
                        <p>With the general conduct and bearing of the Bey in the difficult part
                            which he has had to act different European governments are evidently
                            well satisfied, and are disposed to lend what diplomatic aid they can to
                            counterbalance and counteract French power and influence in this regency
                            And to this effect the various decorations, visits, and presentations of
                            which I have spoken (aside from those of France) are expressive and
                            significant, giving the Bey encouragement and confidence to stand up
                            unabashed by the side of his powerful neighbor across the line,
                            maintaining a position of neutrality and independence.</p>
                        <p>In furtherance of the object here set forth, and in accordance with the
                            example of other nations, I take the liberty again to call attention to
                            my recommendation in despatch No. 5, in favor of a present from the
                            President, and I suggest for the present a <hi rend="italic"
                                >full-sized</hi> portrait of Washington or Lincoln, in a handsome
                            gilt frame, to compare with the portraits of some European sovereigns
                            hanging around the hall of state at the Bardo Palace; or, instead
                            thereof, a rich sword would be highly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have to report that a rebellion of
                            considerable magnitude has recently broken out in this regency,
                            threatening serious consequences unless soon checked. Since the adoption
                            of the constitution in 1860 a personal tax of four and a half dollars
                            has been levied on all male Tunisian subjects above 15 years of age,
                            except those born in the city of Tunis. This tax has encountered some
                            opposition; but this year, in consequence in part of the tax being
                            doubled, the opposition has become violent, and several mountain tribes,
                            occupying a part of the regency towards the line of Algeria, have
                            revolted and are now in open rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Another complaint brought against the government by disaffected parties
                            is, that the constitutional tribunals are corrupt, causing great expense
                            to litigants by reason of delay and bribery. Formerly the Bey
                            administered justice in person, daily hearing and deciding cases in the
                            grand hall; and the facility and promptitude with which judgments were
                            pronounced and executed, united to the honor of appearing before the
                            sovereign, seemed to accord with the ideas of this people; and now the
                            cry is raised, “Down with the tribunals, and down with all reforms that
                            would separate us from our sovereign; let the Bey judge us, giving us
                            the light of his countenance as of old.”</p>
                        <p>Another outcry, very common among the disaffected, is against <hi
                                rend="italic">“the slaves.”</hi> This is a thrust against the Bey’s
                            chief ministers, generals, and confidential advisers, most of whom were
                            once <hi rend="italic">slaves,</hi> having been brought here captives
                            from the Grecian islands and the coast of Asia Minor. It is a
                            mortification and sore trial to the native aristocracy, composed of
                            land-owners, ecclesiastics, and petty monopolists, to see new men, once
                            in bondage, elevated by their intelligence, liberal ideas, and energy of
                            character, into the most responsible political offices of the country;
                            and hence the Bey is called upon, through the influence of prejudice and
                            envy, to return to old forms and customs, rejecting the measures
                            recently adopted in the name of civilization and constitutional liberty.
                            I believe the Bey to be well disposed towards all progressive measures;
                            but, as he has assured me, he can give constitutional liberty and
                            privileges only as his people are prepared to receive them,</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian government is now actively occupied in raising and bringing
                            together troops (10,000 is the complement) with which to overcome the
                            rebels. The Italian mail steamer was detained to bring soldiers from
                            Susa, and the French mail steamer has gone to Boua under French consular
                            orders. An English man-of-war (a steam corvette) left the Goletta last
                            evening for Susa, and the speedy approach of a French squadron is
                            expected. But it is well understood that the Bey desires no interference
                            in his affairs by either of these powers that would but too gladly lend
                            him aid.</p>
                        <p>One of the Bey’s generals and a few of his soldiers have been slain while
                            attempting to quell a mutiny in the rebellious country. Kairwan, the
                            holy city, has been taken, the governor of it fleeing at the approach of
                            an army of Bedouins. Considerable depredations have been made within ten
                            miles of this city. There is much restlessness and agitation here
                            arising from disaffection, fear, or the hope of plunder, and some
                            families have suddenly left the country. Last evening there was great
                            consternation for a while on the public square. The Bey’s troops were
                            ordered out in large numbers, some arrests were made, and the consulates
                            and principal points in the city were strongly guarded.</p>
                        <p>But I have now to report, receiving my information direct from the
                            minister of foreign affairs, that “the Bey has so far yielded to the
                            pressure upon him as to abolish <hi rend="italic">provisionally</hi> the
                            constitution and its tribunals, and to allow the personal <pb
                                facs="0465" n="441" xml:id="pg_441"/> tax to remain at four and a
                            half dollars.” This action, together with the appearance of the Bey this
                            morning in the hall of justice, has awakened a strong feeling in his
                            favor, and hopes begin to be entertained of a reconciliation between him
                            and his rebellions subjects, who profess personally to love and
                            reverence him.</p>
                        <p>To give an air of friendliness and confidence to the government, and to
                            help prevent any appearance of antagonism between the two powers that
                            claim to be <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the friends of the
                            Bey, the presence of the Constellation is, I think, at this time
                            desired; and I have, after confidential consultation, sent word to
                            Commander Stellwagen that an early visit from him would be especially
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Since writing despatch No. 32, stating the
                            origin and causes of the insurrection in this regency, together with the
                            steps taken by the Bey to restore order and tranquillity, some incidents
                            have occurred and facts havecometo my knowledge which I deem my duty to
                            report. The attempt at first made by the Bey to overcome the rebellion
                            by means of an organized force proved a signal failure. By great
                            exertions and at great expense a few thousand troops were brought
                            together armed and equipped, but they were not in a state of mind to
                            suit the Bey’s purposes. Many of the men speedily deserted, and all of
                            them were pronounced demoralized. Indeed, soldiers and people whose
                            loyalty had not been suspected were found to sympathize with the rebels,
                            and when the hour of trial came they shrank from an active co-operation
                            with the Bey in his effort to overcome the rebels. In this condition the
                            Bey was compelled, unless he had recourse to foreign aid, to concede all
                            that was originally asked from him by his disaffected subjects. He
                            yielded too late for his honor, but yet in season to lull a violent
                            storm of passion, and to win back to his allegiance some cities and
                            tribes that were in arms against him.</p>
                        <p>In some quarters, however, this conciliatory action of the Bey has been
                            regarded as a proof of weakness and as a signal for united action
                            against his authority. In Monaster and Mehdia, where we have consular
                            agents, Jews and Christians have suffered personal insults and injuries,
                            and some houses in the latter place have been attacked and pillaged. But
                            the visit of an English or Italian man-of-war has had a salutary
                            influence in establishing order and repressing the fanatical and
                            infuriated mob.</p>
                        <p>The reports from the interior are contradictory. It is evident, however,
                            that the Bey hopes for the complete re-establishment of order without
                            foreign aid, of which most cordial offers are made by at least three
                            different nations. The interest awakened in Europe by the report of this
                            rebellion may be judged from the fact that three French ships of the
                            line were in the harbor at the Goletta within forty-eight hours after
                            the news of the outbreak reached Toulon, and an Italian corvette and
                            frigate came with like speed and promptness from Spezzia. I enclose a
                            list of the men-of-war now in the harbor of the Goletta, (enclosure <pb
                                facs="0466" n="442" xml:id="pg_442"/> No. 1.) Other French, English,
                            and Italian ships are daily expected, together with one man-of-war from
                            Spain and one from Austria. Commander Stellwagen, of the Constellation,
                            is prevented from being here by sickness.</p>
                        <p>At this time no danger is, I think, to be apprehended from a plundering
                            incursion of the Arabs from the interior. The show of force from abroad
                            is enough to tranquillize the passions of the Arabs on the coast, and to
                            prevent combinations for the execution of concerted plans for the
                            extermination of the hated infidels.</p>
                        <p>The government of the rebels is reported to be organized, with Kef and
                            Kairwan as the capitals. A sheik has been elected by the
                            insurrectionists, who daily sits in the former city to decide questions
                            and administer justice. His rule is said to be less agreeable to French
                            subjects dwelling along the line of Algeria than to his people; and
                            predictions begin to be made of a collision between his forces and
                            French troops, who would rejoice to find some pretext for a quarrel.</p>
                        <p>It is due to say that the constitution of Tunis was adopted in 1860, in
                            concurrence with the views of European consuls, and under special
                            pressure brought to bear by the consuls of France and England. The hasty
                            execution by the Bey of a Jew, who was a Tunisian subject, gave impulse
                            to action in behalf of constitutional government. The constitution has
                            had its friends and its opponents alike among Europeans and Moors; but
                            Ibelieve therehas been no great demonstration of dissatisfaction, till
                            since the arrival of the new French consul last autumn. Notwithstanding
                            the fact that his predecessor had virtually forced the Bey to adopt the
                            constitution, he was instructed not to recognize it, and he has exerted
                            his influence against it. On the other hand, the English government
                            recognized the constitution last autumn by a special convention, and the
                            English consul has encouraged the Bey to persevere in maintaining it.
                            The Italian consul has rather coincided with the French view of affairs,
                            and other consuls have acted a somewhat independent part, defending the
                            right of the English to treat with the Bey.</p>
                        <p>The antagonistic views of the English and French are at this time quite
                            manifest. The French appear to exult at what has occurred, while the
                            English express only regrets and the hope of the speedy termination of
                            the difficulties. Meanwhile men-of-war are accumulating in the harbor,
                            and the agitation in the city is intense.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the French consul, accompanied by the vice-governor general of
                            Algeria and the admiral of the French fleet, visited the Bey, and urged
                            him in a formal manner to abolish the constitution and dismiss his chief
                            minister. The Bey, in reply, requested that, for the sake of
                            explicitness, the demands be put in writing, and promised a reply in
                            writing; but being further pressed, said that though he had adopted the
                            constitution to please the French consul, he had suspended it to please
                            him and his own subjects; and in regard to his first minister, being
                            satisfied with him, he should not dismiss him. The French consul left
                            the Bey dissatisfied; and the Bey has to-day given an account of this
                            interview to the other consuls.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Since writing despatch No. 34, relative to
                            the rebellion, I have been invited to the Bardo, and have received from
                            the chief minister the statement which I append.</p>
                        <p>The antagonism between the French and English consuls is very marked. The
                            French consul is bent on the complete destruction of the constitution
                            and on the removal of the Bey’s chief minister, while the English consul
                            is opposed to both of these movements. While I allow the principle that
                            the form of a government should depend upon the character and wants of a
                            people, I must favor constitutional liberty and independence rather than
                            absolutism and dependence.</p>
                        <p>The reports from the interior of the country are favorable to the
                            restoration of tranquillity and order. Several tribes and cities have
                            returned to their allegiance to the Bey, restoring numerous flocks and
                            herds which they had stolen. Some outbreaks have, however, occurred in
                            cities situated along the shore. In Sfax, where we have an agent, many
                            Jews and Christians have been robbed of all their possessions, and all
                            the French subjects taking refuge on board a man-of-war have come to the
                            Goletta. In this city have occurred some outbursts of passion, directed
                            especially against Tunisian Jews, some thousands of whom have suddenly
                            doffed their Moorish garb and red caps, putting on instead thereof
                            European clothes and hats.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to predict the complete restoration of tranquillity until
                            a better understanding exists between the leading European consuls.
                            Christian and Jewish families are leaving the country in large numbers
                            for Malta, Italy, France, and Algeria; and the Goletta is thronged with
                            people who have come there from Tunis and the surrounding country to be
                            within range of European war ships. Consternation prevails more
                            particularly among the Jews. The Bey is exerting his best energies for
                            the maintenance of order, and I think if he could have the harmonious
                            co-operation of the consuls all signs of revolt would soon
                            disappear.</p>

                        <p>Two more French men-of-war, two Italian, one English, and one Ottoman
                            have arrived at the Goletta during the week, making in all twenty war
                            vessels that are now in the harbors of the regency.</p>

                            <p>On the 29th day of April, 1864, the French consul, accompanied by the
                                aide-de-camp of the governor general of Algeria, the admiral of the
                                French fleet, and Colonel Compenon, a French subject in the employ
                                of the Bey, visited the Bardo, and asked for an interview with the
                                Bey, aside from the prime minister. An interview was granted by the
                                Bey, in company with the minister, on the condition that the latter
                                should take no part in it, unless desired. The consul assured the
                                Bey of the good will of his master, the Emperor of France. The Bey
                                expressed pleasure at receiving such an assurance. The consul then
                                urged the Bey, in behalf of his government, to rescind the
                                constitution and dismiss his chief minister. The Bey replied that he
                                had adopted the constitution only under the united counsel and
                                pressure of France and England, and he could in good faith rescind
                                it only with their assent and approbation. England still held him to
                                his engagement to maintain the constitution as the fundamental law
                                of the land, and he could not break faith with England to conform to
                                the changing counsel of France. He had, however, so far yielded to
                                new counsel from France, and to demands from a portion of his own
                                subjects, as to temporarily suspend, with the approbation of the
                                English consul, certain provisions of the constitution. In regard to
                                his minister, the Bey said that it was easier to dismiss him than to
                                fill his place. He regretted that he was not blessed with
                                trustworthy servants able and competent to manage his affairs.</p>
                            <p>The consul replied that it was necessary to rescind the constitution
                                in order to restore tranquillity, and offered to name for minister
                                one who would, with the aid that France would cordially give,
                                produce results to the glory and honor of the Bey. He said the prime
                                minister had enriched himself, impoverished his country, disgusted
                                natives and foreigners, and that his removal would alone restore
                                tranquillity and give hope of renewed prosperity.</p>
                            <p>At this stage in the conversation the Bey suggested that the demands
                                and reply be made in writing. The consul expressed a willingness to
                                receive a reply in writing, but refused to make his demands in
                                writing.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Compenon interrupted the conversation with impertinent
                                remarks. Pointing to the minister, he said: “You are the author of
                                all these troubles.” He was finally checked by the consul. Neither
                                the Bey nor the minister addressed to him a word in reply, and gave
                                no occasion by word or deed for any affront to be taken.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the Bey, taking the hand of his minister, left the hall
                                under plea of indisposition.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                            letter received from the Bey on the 8th instant, relative to an effort
                            of the admiral of the French fleet to land troops at the Goletta under
                            the pretext of defending the Bey and protecting the <pb facs="0469"
                                n="445" xml:id="pg_445"/> city from an incursion of the Arabs. The
                            troops finding the entrance of the canal closed, and the governor
                            unwilling to remove the chain, returned to the ships. This affair caused
                            much excitement in Tunis, arousing the indignation of the Moors, and
                            exciting the fears of the Europeans.</p>
                        <p>A French subject, employed by the Bey as consul at Bona under an
                            exequatur from the Emperor of France, came to the city last week, after
                            having had much intercourse with the Bey’s rebellious subjects residing
                            near the line of Algeria. He was graciously received by the Bey, and on
                            the 8th instant attempted to return to Bona by the French steamer
                            charged with despatches from the Bey. He was, however, prevented from
                            taking passage by express orders from the French consul. This act has
                            been characterized as arbitrary and contrary to the law of nations.</p>
                        <p>The French consul has for some time employed as a night guard for his
                            consulate numerous Algerine Arabs, who are French subjects. This act is
                            variously interpreted, and is by Tunisians condemned as a violation of
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>On the 11th instant arrived in the harbor, at the Goletta, an Ottoman
                            frigate, Feis Bahu, 28 cannon, 250 men, having on board the Ottoman
                            ambassador and suite, Hider Effendi Pasha, of the grade of Mowshir; an
                            Ottoman frigate, Souvir, 22 cannon, 250 men; and an advice steamer, 2
                            cannon, 100 men, 11 days from Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>On the appearance of the Turkish fleet, the Bey’s health officers
                            attempted to visit the ships, but were prevented by armed marines sent
                            out by the French admiral. The French admiral soon visited the Sultan’s
                            ambassador on shipboard, and remained in his company about two hours, at
                            the end of which time the Bey’s officers were permitted to communicate
                            with the fleet, and to escort the ambassador and his suite on shore, and
                            to the Bey’s palace in Tunis. The object of the Turkish mission is not
                            yet known.</p>
                        <p>The chiefs of a number of rebellious tribes have presented themselves
                            before the Bey at the Bardo during the week, asking pardon for their
                            misconduct, and promising submission and obedience in future. The
                            general news from the interior is pacific, but the cities along the
                            coast are more agitated than usual. The Bey’s military agents at Susa,
                            Monaster, Media, and Sfax, have given out word that they cannot, with
                            their present force, guarantee the safety of Europeans. This
                            announcement has caused a general flight of Europeans—some escaping to
                            other countries, and others coming to the Gloletta and Tunis; and from
                            here thousands are escaping, crowding all the steamers and vessels bound
                            to foreign ports.</p>
                        <p>I announce, on the authority of one of the parties here named, that the
                            English, French, and Italian consuls and naval officers have received
                            orders not to intervene in the governmental affairs of Tunis, but are to
                            strive to act in harmony with each other for the protection of European
                            subjects. A written correspondence has been carried on by French and
                            English consuls about Tunisian affairs, without coming to any good
                            understanding; and several conferences have more recently been held by
                            the French, English, and Italian consuls, but the points discussed, and
                            the results of the interviews, have not been made public.</p>
                        <p>I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                                Him, and reports all things to Him, the Musher Mohammed. Essadek,
                                Pasha Bey, sovereign of the Tunisian kingdom.</p>
                            <p>To the honored and respected Monsieur Amos Perry, consul of the
                                United States of America in our capital, Tunis; may God preserve him
                                !</p>
                            <p>Our governor at the Goletta has informed us that he was called upon
                                at about one o’clock, after midnight, by the French Vice-Consul
                                Cubisal, who wished him to remove the chain that bars the entrance
                                to the canal, pretending that the admiral told him that he was
                                authorized by the French consul to land troops from the fleet, on
                                account of some disturbances that had happened, it was said, in the
                                capital, and the admiral at the same time sent from the vessels
                                nearly 400 men in boats and in a steamer to the mouth of the canal.
                                But, in reality, no disturbances have taken place in the capital, as
                                you have seen. Similar doings are among the greatest causes that
                                give rise to disturbances in the present state of things. So we have
                                addressed to him (the French consul) a letter, a copy of which is
                                herein enclosed, and we have written to you also to inform you of
                                the fact, that you may know that if any disturbances take place on
                                account of this doing, or the like of it, the responsibility falls
                                on him who has been the cause. And may you live long in the keeping
                                of God.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Little progress has been made within the
                            last two weeks in the Tunisian question. Some robberies have been
                            committed at various points along the shore, and several of the Bey’s
                            former officers have been slain. Other chiefs have submitted to the Bey,
                            and serious quarrels have arisen among the rebels. The most serious
                            difficulty, however, which the Bey has to encounter is the want of
                            fidelity among his own troops. These desert in large numbers, and many
                            of them join with the rebels. Considerable development is visible in the
                            diplomatic bearings of the question. The consul of France has explained
                            the object of the Emperor in having a large fleet at hand, and also the
                            object of the Ottoman ambassador in coming here. The ambassador has
                            exchanged calls with most of the consuls, and has shown himself disposed
                            to maintain relations especially intimate with this consulate. He would
                            be glad to have the Bey acknowledge himself the subject of the Sublime
                            Porte, but says that France puts herself in the way to prevent such an
                            acknowledgment. The English consul has shown me a despatch from Earl
                            Russell, stating that the French government had agreed not to intervene
                            in Tunisian affairs. England is uniting with Turkey in favor of
                            reasserting the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, the leading principles
                            of which are—</p>

                            <p>You know, sir, that France has here important naval forces, and that
                                if, unhappily, circumstances should become still more grave she
                                would augment them; but our squadron has, I need not inform you, no
                                other object than to secure the safety of our countrymen, and to
                                witness, by the presence of the French flag, that the government of
                                the Emperor does not neglect their interests. But the respect which
                                we bear to the independence of all nations, and especially the care
                                which France takes in a feeble neighboring nation, render it
                                desirable to disembark troops only in case of imperious
                                necessity.</p>
                            <p>I request you to inform our countrymen placed under your jurisdiction
                                of the manœuvres, which I need not characterize, calculated to give
                                to the natives a wrong idea of our intentions. You will say to them
                                also that if private convenience and the shallowness of the water in
                                certain ports do not permit the national colors to appear often, the
                                consulate general is nevertheless ready to come to their assistance
                                in case of emergency. The ambassador of his Highness the Sultan of
                                Turkey has just arrived, with the title of Mushir. He has come to
                                Tunis only after a good understanding between the courts of France
                                and Turkey.</p>

                                France, and without the intention formally expressed to respect and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The events and developments of the week are
                            far from encouraging a hope that the Tunisian difficulty will be
                            speedily settled. Italian, French, and Belgian journals contain articles
                            denouncing in strong terms English and Ottoman intrigue, and crimination
                            and recrimination are freely expressed by the opposing parties. Though
                            fleets of considerable importance are at hand with instructions to
                            co-operate for the safety of Europeans and for the tranquillity of the
                            country an influence is exerted unfavorable to these results.</p>
                        <p>I hereby enclose a circular of the French consul, giving a view of the
                                <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> entirely at variance with the
                            English and Ottoman explanations contained in my last letter.</p>
                        <p>Steamers have arrived during the week from Gabes, Sfax, and other cities
                            along the coast, with intelligence that the Bey’s authority is
                            completely set aside in those places, and parties are in power calling
                            for Turkish rule under English protection. The indications are numerous
                            of a disturbed state of feeling in this city, and hostility to the Bey’s
                            government is reported to be on the increase in the interior. The Bey
                            and well-informed Mussulmen are believed to exert their utmost influence
                            for the maintenance of order, while foreign politicians and fanatical
                            Mussulmans, by a singular concurrence of measures, contribute to the
                            general disorder.</p>
                        <p>The affairs of the regency appear more grave now than at any previous
                            time. The Bey is beset with opposing counsellors. Some insist upon a
                            change in his ministers, others that he should yield to no such
                            counsels. Some urge the presence and support of French troops, and the
                            French Emperor indorses this proposition by the offer of men and money
                            on a liberal scale. Others resist such counsels, urging the Bey to rely
                            on himself. Still another party urge a resort to English and Ottoman
                            support. The Bey appears in a maze. Hampered and paralyzed in his
                            movements, he does but little for the establishment of order.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile commerce and industry are paralyzed, merchants are ruined, and
                            the country is forsaken by those Europeans who are able to make their
                            escape to a more secure region.</p>
                        <p>As I write a letter is received announcing that the Turkish flag floats
                            over Susa.</p>
                        <p>Should the French land troops, as they tried, and still propose to do in
                            case of emergency, a general pillage of the city and murder of the
                            Europeans would be likely to result.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Tunis has been profoundly agitated since my
                            last despatch. It was whispered, about two weeks since, that some
                            startling and decisive event was at hand. French troops were stationed
                            near the Algerine confines, and had accumulated in the harbor of the
                            Goletta, to the number of nearly 2,000, and the arrival of several iron
                            clad war-ships from France and Italy gave rise afresh to the report that
                            the combined forces of these two nations were to land. Other reports,
                            compromising the character of England and Turkey, were equally
                            calculated to enlist attention and terrify. Robberies were committed
                            between Tunis and the Goletta. Some of the Bey’s bravest troops, the
                            zouaves, were disorderly in the streets, manifesting hostility to
                            Europeans. The news from the coast and the interior was unfavorable to
                            peace and order. All business was suspended, and horrid stories were
                            told of Moslem hatred, and of massacres that were likely to attend the
                            disembarcation of troops. The result was a general panic, and thousands
                            of Jews and Christians of the better classes hurried out of the country
                            for personal security. The Spanish consul general left two weeks since,
                            and this week the Swedish and Dutch consuls, who have passed their whole
                            lives here, have departed. The poor and laboring classes, finding no
                            employment and threatened with starvation, if not with massacre, have
                            been helped off by their respective consuls in large numbers, so that
                            now comparatively few European families remain here.</p>
                        <p>At the present time fears of immediate danger are not so general. The
                            landing of troops and other warlike demonstrations which were
                            confidently predicted are not witnessed, and the news from the interior
                            is of an encouraging character. And as the war cloud appears less
                            portentous, the question is raised Who <pb facs="0474" n="450"
                                xml:id="pg_450"/> has caused this agitation and panic; to whose
                            indiscretion is this general ruin to be attributed? The French and the
                            Anglo-Turkish parties are unsparing in their criticisms upon each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>Among the natives animosity against the French is intense, and it would
                            require but little indiscretion on the part of the Tunisian and French
                            officials to light up a war that would arouse the most bitter Moslem
                            hatred against the infidels. The Anglo-Turkish party is popular among
                            the Moors, but can do nothing, watched and constrained by the
                            overpowering forces of the French. There are here substantially three
                            parties. One party opposes all intervention, maintaining that the Bey,
                            left to himself, will be able in due time to overcome all opposition in
                            his dominions, and to settle his difficulties in the best manner. This
                            party opposes equally the officious claims and pretensions of the French
                            and of the Ottoman party, and is composed of Tunisian officials and of
                            individuals of various nationalities, whose sole object is quietness and
                            order. Most of the consuls are classed at the present time with the
                            non-intervention party, maintaining that it will be in season to provide
                            for a European congress when the necessity shall be satisfactorily
                            demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>The other two parties appear agreed in regard to the necessity of foreign
                            intervention, but differ in regard to the nation that shall take upon
                            itself the responsibility of intervening. One of these parties maintains
                            that the Emperor of France is the natural and legal protector of the
                            Bey. Tunis is near Algeria, and French troops and the French navy can
                            readily render all needed assistance. And further it is added, that
                            France has maintained the character of a protector to the Bey for a
                            third of a century, having, on one occasion, marched her troops into the
                            interior to quell an insurrection and punish disturbers of the public
                            peace, and having prevented, at the request of the then reigning Bey,
                            the disembarcation of Ottoman troops and the interference of the Sultan
                            in the affairs of the regency. As the neighbor and <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> protector of the Bey, France is pronounced the rightful
                            power to stretch forth her strong arm to restore tranquillity and order,
                            and to extend the benign influence of civilization in this regency. And
                            further it is urged, as a matter of honor, that since France does not
                            interfere with the controlling influence of England in Morocco, England
                            ought not to interfere with the controlling influence of France in
                            Tunis.</p>
                        <p>In opposition to this stands forth the Turkish claim supported by
                            England. For centuries the Grand Sultan has exercised the right of
                            suzerainty over this regency, investing the Beys of Tunis with the
                            rights and responsibilities of their office; and his right so to act has
                            not been disputed He has never given to any Bey the right to diminish
                            his territory, or to call French arms to his support; and, consequently,
                            if any Bey has exercised such right, he has acted without authority, and
                            contrary to the law and custom; and if France has interfered in Tunisian
                            affairs, she has done so against law and custom, and against the
                            suzerainty of the Sublime Porte. Questions of convenience, neighborhood,
                            and civilization are aside and independent of the main question of the
                            right of suzerainty, and therefore need not be here considered. If the
                            Sultan is divested of the right of suzerainty, when was it done? And why
                            does he continue to exercise the right of investiture? Why does all the
                            money in the regency continue to be coined in his name? And why are
                            prayers offered in his behalf every Friday in all the mosques?</p>
                        <p>Again, it is argued, on the ground of the independence of the Bey as
                            maintained by the French, that Turkey, if any power, should interfere in
                            Tunisian affairs, since Turkey is the natural ally and protector of the
                            Bey, both on the ground of affinity in religious concerns and of actual
                            preference, as shown by the demands of the people in the cities along
                            the coast. This point is specially argued by the British consul, while
                            the French consul shows no favor for his application of the Napoleonic
                            doctrine of popular sovereignty. Many Christians <pb facs="0475" n="451"
                                xml:id="pg_451"/> and Jews of various nations favor Ottoman rather
                            than French intervention as a means of obviating the horrors of a
                            religious war.</p>
                        <p>While studiously avoiding the spirit and attitude of a partisan, I deem
                            it my duty to give my cordial support to the Bey in his efforts to
                            prevent all foreign intervention. A revolt sprang up against the French
                            in Algeria before any demonstration was made against the Bey in Tunisia;
                            and I see no more reason for interfering at present with the latter
                            government than with the former. The Bey is feeble, but his feebleness
                            is, I believe, due in some degree to impositions practiced upon him by
                            his powerful neighbors through jealousy of each other’s influence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Since sending off despatch No. 42 the
                            aspect of affairs here has somewhat changed. I am informed by the consul
                            of Italy that the cabinets of London, Paris, and Turin have come to an
                            understanding to this effect: Neither of the first two named powers are
                            in any emergency to interfere with the Bey. France withdraws all
                            pretension as his protector, and England is to discountenance any
                            interference by the Sultan. The effect of this understanding has been to
                            bring the French and English consuls to act in harmony with each other.
                            The French party and the Anglo-Ottoman party are lost sight of for the
                            moment. The immense French armament by sea and land is pronounced to
                            have been mainly designed to prevent Turkish aggressions, encouraged by
                            England; and England appears to have supported Turkey to prevent French
                            aggressions.</p>
                        <p>Since this arrangement has been understood here, one of the English
                            commanders has visited Sfax and successfully exerted his influence to
                            have the Ottoman flag removed and that of the Bey raised in its
                            place.</p>
                        <p>In case the Bey, unable to restore order, demands aid, Italy is to
                            intervene, and is to withdraw her forces from Tunis immediately on the
                            re-establishment of order. Already Italy is preparing for the work of
                            intervention. Her engineers are here, and many of her troops are in the
                            harbor, and others are ready to be transported from Cagliari and Genoa
                            to the African shore. The number of vessels-of-war in our harbor is now
                            twenty-two, fourteen of which are Italian,</p>
                        <p>The Bey has this week succeeded in getting off a body of troops to
                            overcome the rebels, and the result of this expedition is awaited with
                            varied expressions of interest, the French and Italians predicting a
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>The premier of Italy has lately announced in Parliament that the Italian
                            policy is in favor of the independence of the Bey. I am satisfied that
                            France is not yet prepared to take Tunis, and hold it as a province. The
                            experiment in Algeria is not favorable to such an undertaking. Too much
                            blood and treasure would be required. But France does not wish Turkey to
                            get possession of Tunis, lest there should be a league among the Moors
                            of all North Africa and the Turks to retake Algeria. It is, I believe,
                            the French policy to have a weak independent power established here
                            either through the Bey or the King of Italy.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servent,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> My last despatch, about the affairs of
                            Tunis, was dated July 2. Since then few events have occurred worthy of
                            record. Rumors of war and of peace have been by turns circulated and
                            contradicted, several petty revolutions have occurred in different
                            localities, and some robberies have been committed. Insurgent cavalry
                            have appeared at different points in the regency, impressing men into
                            their service and appropriating provisions to their use. But few days
                            ago eighty wagon loads of provisions, intended for the Bey’s army at
                            Beja, were seized, together with a quantity of horses, mules, and
                            camels, and the Bey’s men were stripped of even the clothes upon their
                            backs. Two days afterwards, however, all these things were restored, and
                            the marauders were punished. The people have been in a state of feverish
                            excitement; at some points they have raised the Turkish flag and called
                            for English protection, and everywhere have made demonstrations of ill
                            will towards the French.</p>
                        <p>The French and Italian navies have continued to be represented by about
                            twenty war vessels and some 12,000 marines, while England and Turkey
                            have kept here usually four or five war vessels. French and Italian
                            officials have been able to predict only feebleness, disorder, and
                            confusion in the regency so long as the Mamelukes should be continued in
                            power; while the English and Tunisian officials have uniformly spoken
                            hopefully in regard to the future. There has been shown a general
                            disposition to disparage, if not to embarrass, the government. It has
                            been represented as past the hope of recovery, and it has indeed
                            presented a pitiful aspect. Some representatives of powerful nations
                            united in sustaining the demands of the rebels, and of the Bey’s army of
                            5,000 men, sent out to encounter the insurgents, more than 500 deserted
                            and joined the insurgent camp. Little spirit and no enthusiasm has at
                            any time been manifested in behalf of the Bey, while, on the other hand,
                            the rebels have been well organized, and have exhibited much <hi
                                rend="italic">esprit du corps</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Still a triumph on the part of the Bey is proclaimed. Day before
                            yesterday the director in the Foreign Office called upon every consul to
                            announce, in behalf of his master, the establishment of peace. The
                            conditions named are a diminution of taxes and a general amnesty. There
                            were numerous demonstrations of satisfaction, particularly about the
                            English consulate. The large flag was raised, and a band of music
                            contributed to the enjoyment of the occasion. From prudential
                            considerations I avoided showy and noisy demonstrations of rejoicing,
                            but have to-day presented my congratulations to the Bey in person. I
                            expressed the hope that the peace proclaimed might be substantial and
                            lasting, and that from it might result, under the rule of his Highness,
                            the permanent prosperity of this regency. I assured his Highness of the
                            good will of the American government, and alluded to the expression of
                            interest in Tunisian affairs contained in your last despatch. He
                            appeared gratified by such an expression from the Mexican minister, and
                            begged me to assure him, in return, of his best wishes for the complete
                            success of our government. He is kept informed in regard to our affairs
                            by the official Arab journal, which is edited by an ardent friend of
                            America, and contains some piquant articles on the slavery question, and
                            a weekly summary of American news.</p>
                        <p>The Bey is of Moorish character as well as origin. He is guarded in his
                            expressions, and in conversation shows good sense rather than much
                            intelligence. His face indicates kindness and melancholy, rather than
                            energy. He is rarely seen except at the side of his prime minister, who,
                            though subordinate in office, is vastly superior in ability. Sidi
                            Mustafa is worthy of his Greek origin; shrewd and persevering, he is to
                            be characterized rather as a manager than a statesman. <pb facs="0477"
                                n="453" xml:id="pg_453"/> His efforts have been more effectual for
                            his personal aggrandizement than for the prosperity and wellbeing of the
                            state. He has become rich, while the country has become poor; his
                            tactics, however, have of late been particularly serviceable to the Bey.
                            Without suffering his temper to be ruffled by officious consuls, he has
                            wearied the rebels with delays, amused them with promises, bribed them
                            with money, and frightened them with the show of arms, and especially
                            with the fear of foreign intervention, so that they have become weakened
                            and divided.</p>
                        <p>It is due to say that there is a question in some minds in regard to the
                            genuineness and permanence of the peace proclaimed. The French and the
                            Italians are unbelieving, and their ships-of-war continue to guard the
                            harbor; yet I am persuaded that the report of the peace is substantially
                            true, and that the rebel leaders have acted from a regard to their true
                            interest in yielding submission to the Bey.</p>
                        <p>With great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In my last despatch I referred to
                            demonstrations of joy made on one side at the announcement of peace in
                            this regency, and to expressions of coolness and incredulity elicited on
                            the other side on the same occasion. Each party attempted to convict the
                            other of folly, and to show its own wisdom by a statement of facts in
                            conformity with its own views and line of conduct. The official Arab
                            journal contained a letter from the general of the camp, with the names
                            of fourteen of the principal tribes that had submitted to the Bey and
                            received his pardon. The chiefs of some other tribes were reported as
                            having come to the Bardo on the same errand. Grain and provisions, for
                            the want of which the city was suffering, began to pour in, and petty
                            skirmishes are reported among the tribes in the interior. These facts,
                            and many others of minor importance, were represented in glowing terms
                            by the Anglo-Otto man-Mameluke party.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the French anti-Mameluke party disparaged the
                            representations received from the Bardo, affirming that though gold had
                            bought over some chiefs, the spirit of opposition to the Mameluke
                            government was unchanged. The concessions were shown to be rather on the
                            side of the Bey than of the rebels. The Bey had demanded of his loyal
                            subjects nine dollars poll-tax, but had treated with his rebellious
                            subjects to receive two and a half dollars, and to diminish other taxes
                            in a similar ratio. After this degradation he was far from having peace.
                            Susa was blockaded by hostile Arabs, and the whole coast was in a state
                            of revolution. The government was represented to be without credit, if
                            not bankrupt, and the opinion was confidently pronounced that Sidi
                            Mustafa must quit his post as chief minister before any substantial
                            peace could be witnessed in the kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Still, indications of a better state of feeling were not to be denied.
                            Robberies ceased, notwithstanding the people of the city ventured to
                            make excursions into the country. The steamers were no longer crowded
                            with persons fleeing for their lives. On the other hand, some who had
                            left the country for personal security began to return. Congratulations
                            and felicitations were not only received from most of the consuls, but
                            from several of the European cabinets; and the Bey issued a circular to
                            the consuls, which I give in enclosure A.</p>
                        <pb facs="0478" n="454" xml:id="pg_454"/>
                        <p>In this state of things a new report was set afloat from the French
                            consulate. It was asserted that the French minister of foreign affairs
                            had demanded the dismission of Sidi Mustafa. The most exaggerated
                            statements were made and for awhile believed. The city seemed as it were
                            set on fire. Moorish indignation was aroused, and the most bitter
                            Moorish enemies of Sidi Mustafa rallied to his support; thus defeating
                            the primary object probably had in view by those who originated the
                            report. But soon rumor gave way to a statement of facts as follows: A
                            sealed letter was received by the Bey, from the French minister of
                            foreign affairs, containing expressions of friendship for the Bey—a
                            desire to see his independence maintained, and a hope that the Bey would
                            not hesitate to make concessions to his subjects in favor of peace and
                            order.</p>
                        <p>This letter may be regarded as a simple expression of friendship and good
                            will on the part of the imperial government, or it may be interpreted as
                            a polite indorsement of the officious demands of the French consul. The
                            Bey received it in the light most favorable to his views and purposes,
                            and returned an answer to the imperial minister with expressions of
                            gratitude for his generous interest. But the ink was scarcely dry on the
                            Bey’s letter of thanks to the French minister when the French consul
                            appeared at the Bardo with a despatch in his hand from his minister, of
                            which the following is a summary: “Your conduct at the Tunisian court is
                            approved by the department; persevere in your course.” With an
                            expression of confidence and satisfaction the consul says to the Bey:
                            “Now you see I am supported in my demands for the dismission of Sidi
                            Mustafa. I repeat my demand to the same effect, and I shall await your
                            reply twenty-four hours.” “Begging your pardon,” replied the Bey, “I see
                            no such thing. I have just received a letter from your minister, who
                            makes no such demand. On the contrary, he expresses sentiments of
                            friendship for me, and a desire to see the independence of my government
                            maintained. I shall not dismiss my minister except by compulsion. If you
                            have any demands to make you will please make them in writing, and they
                            will be answered accordingly.” The interview here ended, though comments
                            and inferences continue to. be made.</p>
                        <p>One inference is, that the French are in earnest, and will continue to
                            vex and harass the Tunisian government until the removal from office of
                            the offensive minister, which act may be heralded as the acknowledgment
                            of their pretensions as the promoters of civilization and the protectors
                            of Tunisian independence. Another inference is, that since the trial of
                            wits has resulted to the advantage of the barbarians, the French will
                            quit the field, though necessarily with diminished respect and
                            influence, to await a more favorable opportunity for their peculiar
                            tactics. Time alone will enable me to express an opinion on these
                            points.</p>
                        <p>A considerable body of troops is soon to be sent off, to reduce to order
                            the Arabs along the eastern coast, who show themselves equally hostile
                            to the French and to the Mameluke rulers of Tunis.</p>
                        <p>The Ottoman envoy, Hayder Effendi, who has the same rank in Turkey
                            (Mouchir) as the Bey of Tunis, occupies, with his suite of attendants,
                            the Bey’s palace in this city. His instructions are to remain till the
                            departure of the French fleet from the harbor of the Goletta. He is a
                            man of culture and agreeable manners, having passed many years at Paris
                            and at St. Petersburg. From the independent position of the American
                            consul, he has felt himself at liberty to visit me often, and to express
                            his opinion freely on political subjects. He says the Sultan desires
                            simply the maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>. The <hi

                        <p>This community has of late been treated to a liberal supply of political
                            scandal from an alleged attempt on the part of Sidi Mustafa to bribe the
                            Austrian ambassador at Paris. The simple facts of the case are as
                            follows: The Princess, <pb facs="0479" n="455" xml:id="pg_455"/> the
                            wife of Sidi Mustafa, sent to the Princess Metternich, the wife of the
                            Austrian ambassador at Paris, a box of diamonds, pearls, &amp;c., valued
                            at 60,000 francs. The Princess Metternich, under instructions from her
                            government’, declined to accept the gift, but wrote a letter of thanks,
                            with a request that the Austrian consul here should, in returning the
                            gift, use the utmost delicacy not to wound the feelings of the parties
                            interested. The box and letter, sealed, were sent through the French
                            department of state to the Austrian consul here, and the French naval
                            officer, on delivering the same, required a written acknowledgment from
                            the Austrian consul. While the Tunisian minister is charged with an
                            attempt at bribery, the French minister is charged with a breach of
                            confidence in an affair of honor.</p>

                                respectable and honorable Mr. Amos Perry, consul general of America,
                                in our capital of Tunis, whom may God preserve.</p>

                            <p>The news has reached us, (by the care) of the general of the camp,
                                informing us that the tribes which were united (for the
                                insurrection) have gone to the camp to ask pardon. The said general
                                has communicated to us the demands of the tribes, to whom we have
                                granted what they asked. Since then each one has gone back to attend
                                to his particular occupations. In order to assure us of that which
                                precedes, the general of the camp has sent us compacts, signed by
                                the tribes, in which these same tribes declare that they accept what
                                is said above.</p>
                            <p>We send you this letter that you may have correct information in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>Who is to blame for the present agitation
                                <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">about</hi> Tunis?
                            This is the staple topic of conversation in this place, and is discussed
                            with more bitterness than ability in the journals of France and Italy.
                            The immediate cause of the rebellion was undoubtedly exorbitant
                            taxation. The radical causes were maladministration and jealousy between
                            the ruling Mamelukes and the native aristocracy. The Greek slave,
                            Mustafa, has become to the Bey what the Hebrew slave Joseph was to
                            Pharaoh. But in that position, though supported by his master, he is
                            hated by his fellow-subjects. To his charge are <pb facs="0480" n="456"
                                xml:id="pg_456"/> laid all the evils that afflict the land. He is
                            blamed for the high taxes, corrupt tribunals, and empty treasury. In his
                            turn he hurls back the charges, showing the miserable set of creatures
                            he has to deal with. And truly his appeals excite our commiseration. It
                            is hard to form a state out of ignorant, superstitious, and fanatical
                            subjects.</p>
                        <p>But, aside from the faults of the government and people of Tunis, there
                            are some serious causes of difficulty. Foreign nations know the worth of
                            Tunis as a colony, and the weakness of it as an independent state.
                            Turkey is not ready to relinquish her claims of suzerainty, though she
                            cannot maintain them. England sees here a field for enterprise, and
                            abundant provisions for Malta. France, with Algeria ill at ease, dreads
                            Turkish and English influence in her neighborhood, and desires to extend
                            her territory on the Mediterranean. Italy wants and needs a colony for
                            superabundant population. It is but too plain that these nations are
                            plotting for influence and power, and are ready to take advantage of the
                            mistakes and misfortunes of the Tunisian government. The two leading
                            actors are England and France—Turkey and Italy playing a subordinate
                            part. Until the year 1830 English influence and trade predominated. The
                            occupation of Algeria turned the scale in favor of France. Since then
                            the latter country has been diffusing her ideas and extending her
                            commerce to the disparagement of British ambition. The important
                            enterprises have been given to Frenchmen. Frenchmen have been honored
                            with lucrative posts under the government. The late French consul, who
                            was a good Arabic scholar, and once a Mussulman, was much consulted and
                            honored by the Bey. During his term of service no enterprise could
                            succeed without his patronage. He leaving his post about a year since,
                            the British convention was speedily concluded, giving British subjects,
                            and even the British Queen, the right to hold real estate in Tunis.
                            About the same time arrived the new French consul, who, though an
                            accomplished man, understands neither the Arabic language nor oriental
                            life and manners. Regarding the convention as a piece of state craft,
                            inconsistent with the rules of national courtesy, he employed his utmost
                            influence with the British consul and with the Bey’s minister to break
                            it down. Failing in this object, he attacked the Tunisian constitution,
                            on which the convention is based, ridiculing it as a sham and a humbug.
                            The rebellion, soon breaking out, seemed an occasion suited to the
                            consul’s purposes. The rebels were pronounced in the right and the
                            government in the wrong; and much was done to strengthen the former and
                            embarrass the latter.</p>
                        <p>About this time is alleged to have been made a counter movement by the
                            English consul, viz: to offset French pretensions by Turkish claims. In
                            this conduct the English consul is accused of acting a treacherous part.
                            The result of this action was several demonstrations in favor of the
                            Sultan along the shore.</p>
                        <p>After considering the numerous domestic and foreign causes of the
                            agitation in this regency, I am unable to predict speedy and permanent
                            tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>The Bey has this week sent off troops to the eastern shore.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                            receipt of despatch No. 8, of August 30, 1864. I have this day been to
                            the Bardo to congratulate the minister on the news of the decided
                            victories recently gained over the rebels along the coast. On arriving

                            other ways tried to show myself amiable and useful. I was requested to

                            appeared to labor under the impression that I had done him great service
                            during my three weeks’ absence in explaining his affairs in some of the
                            great cities of Europe, assuring me that he had received an account of
                            one of my expositions of Tunisian affairs, and expressing gratitude
                            therefor. I was, of course, innocent of any ill intention, and so
                            contented myself with claiming to be well disposed towards his
                            Highness’s government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> In my despatch of September 11 (No. 49) I
                            stated that a number of war vessels had left this coast and more were
                            expected soon to leave. But the question was discussed with much warmth
                            which should leave first, the French or the Ottoman fleet. This question
                            was finally settled by the naval commanders thus: All but two of the war
                            vessels of the French, all but two of the English, all but two of the
                            Italian, and the whole Turkish fleet, with the ambassador <pb
                                facs="0482" n="458" xml:id="pg_458"/> on board, were to leave the
                            harbor, at a given signal, on the 23d of September. This plan was
                            carried out, and fourteen war vessels belonging to the four nations
                            above named moved out of the harbor of the Goletta together, the French
                            admiral assuming a position at the right of the Ottoman envoy, and the
                            Italian admiral at the left. Their departure was, I believe, a cause of
                            rejoicing among all the friends of good order in the regency. What were
                            they here for? No one pretended that there had been for a long time any
                            danger from the Bedouins or Arabs. Indeed, the latter have shown
                            hostility to foreigners only when threatened with invasion. Officers
                            belonging to each of these fleets have allowed, in private conversation
                            with me, that they were here to counteract each other’s machinations,
                            rather than to protect their respective nationalities from Arab plunder
                            and assassination. The greatest antagonism existed between the French
                            and the English. A misunderstanding and coolness finally took place
                            between the French and the Italians, and the Turks were not quite
                            satisfied with the restraints imposed upon them by their English
                            friends. Thus mutual distrust and jealousy have marked the course of
                            these international guardians, whose departures from these shores is
                            speedily followed by peace. While those powerful fleets frowned upon the
                            shore, the Bey’s efforts to subdue the rebels were to a great extent
                            paralyzed. His men feared the treacherous Franks, and preferred to
                            encounter <hi rend="italic">them</hi> in battle rather than
                            co-religionist brethren.</p>
                        <p>Though many skirmishes, robberies, and murders have taken place since the
                            rebellion commenced, but one engagement has occurred which deserves to
                            be called a battle. This occurred last week on the eastern coast, and is
                            represented to have been so decided in its character as to bring all the
                            tribes at once to submission. Some 200 persons were killed, as many more
                            wounded, and three times that number taken prisoners. The government at
                            once becomes able to collect its taxes and enforce its laws; and even
                            the French, whose great ambition has been to humble the Bey by securing
                            the fall of his prime minister, now allow that the rebellion is at an
                            end, without the accomplishment of their cherished object. I place much
                            stress on this concession of the French, since they have, by their
                            interference with the government and opposition to its measuses,
                            engendered a large amount of ill feeling and lost many posts of honor,
                            influence, and profit. Their only satisfaction seems to be, that they
                            have demonstrated their determination not to allow other nations to
                            interfere in Tunisian affairs.</p>
                        <p>Already since the “great battle” a cheerful feeling has sprung
                            up—merchants are encouraged with the hope of gain, and peace and
                            prosperity are confidently anticipated by natives and foreigners; and
                            from my stand-point I see no reason why this nation may not now enter
                            upon a new period of its existence, with the promise of increased life,
                            prosperity, and independence. It is evident that while France would
                            probably rise with her full strength to prevent the interference or
                            intervention of any other nation in Tunisian affairs, she is not herself
                            prepared to intervene here, exposed to the gaze and criticisms of the
                            advance nations of the world. The Emperor has probably considered this
                            subject of late and shrinks from a big job. Algeria is hard to manage,
                            and Tunis would but increase his troubles. The Bey may, then, continue
                            to reign despite his powerful, jealous, and greedy neighbors; and it is
                            to be hoped that he will greatly improve his administration, and thus
                            avoid such difficulties and embarrassments as have lately imperilled his
                            throne.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>The changes that have recently taken place
                            in the aspect of Tunisian affairs are so passing strange that I deem
                            them worthy of special note. It is but a few months since every part of
                            this regency, aside from the immediate neighborhood of the capital, was
                            in the power of the rebels. The Bey was beset with enemies, domestic and
                            foreign. He had but a few hundred soldiers, and there were many of them
                            disloyal, escaping as occasions offered to join the enemy; while the
                            rebel force was large, well organized, and in good courage, and the
                            French were apparently seeking some pretext for landing their troops.
                            Hardly a ray of hope could seem to animate the Bey in such a maze of
                            difficulties; his best friends spoke of his affairs but in sad and
                            despairing tones. His motley troops were ready to encounter hated
                            infidels, but not to exercise their weapons upon their co-religionist
                            brethren engaged in a cause for which they had much sympathy. France and
                            Italy and Turkey (through English influence) were ready with proffers of
                            aid, but no aid was sought or received. The Bey persisted in expresing
                            the desire to be left alone in his affairs, and in proportion as he was
                            left to himself he gained influence, respectability, and power among his
                            people, until early in last month the decisive <hi rend="italic"
                                >battle</hi> or skirmish occurred, of which mention is made in Nos.
                            50 and 51.</p>
                        <p>Now, instead of having a few hundred discontented, half-hearted soldiers,
                            the Bey had 20,000 well-disposed men in his service, and the ability to
                            double the number at his pleasure, and the foreign troops that hovered,
                            like ill-omened birds of prey, by thousands along his shore, are
                            departed.</p>
                        <p>At the breaking out of the rebellion the treasury of the government was
                            empty, and no means existed by which to replenish it. Now, though
                            financical difficulty still exists, the Bey has just levied a tax of
                            forty million piastres (one million sterling) on the cities along the
                            eastern shore, and arms and ammunition, oil and grain flow in from every
                            direction. Whereas a few months ago all mouths teemed with expressions
                            of pity or contempt for the Bey, to-day his praises are spoken by
                            foreigners and natives; even the French, who are generally understood to
                            have thrown obstacles and embarrassments in his way at the most critical
                            period of his affairs, are now publishing articles in their journals,
                            taking to themselves the credit of the late governmental successes, and
                            throwing upon the English and Turks the reproach of having fomented and
                            continued the troubles.</p>
                        <p>In one respect no marked change is to be noted. The animosity and
                            antagonism between the officials of the two great rival nations in
                            commerce and politics are unabated, though, perhaps, manifested in
                            different ways. Much scandal is circulated, and efforts are made to show
                            the instrumentalities employed by these nations, respectively, in the
                            late troubles. The English are evidently interested in trade, and are
                            understood to be making an effort to turn through the city of Sfax and
                            Malta the internal commerce of the far south, which has of late years
                            been principally carried on through Algerine ports. This project is
                            watched and combated by the French. Again, since there has never been
                            any boundary line established between Tunis and Algeria, the French fear
                            that the English may, through their late convention in regard to landed
                            estates, get possession of some territory along the confines of Algeria,
                            and thus cause them serious trouble.</p>
                        <p>A few months since foreigners of various nations were hastening from the
                            country by thousands for security, and business was suspended; while now
                            the boats are loaded with people returning to their homes, and business
                            is resuming its accustomed channels. It is but a short time since the
                            chiefs of the various <pb facs="0484" n="460" xml:id="pg_460"/> tribes
                            in the regency stood forth in the attitude of bold defiance to the Bey.
                            To-day they are most of them faithful servants of the Bey, or humble
                            suppliants for his mercy; a few of them have been hung or shot, a few
                            are in prison, anp one or two have escaped to parts unknown.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> Some incidents have occurred and scenes
                            been enacted in this neighborhood within the last few days which I deem
                            it my duty to report. On Saturday, the 12th instant, the Bey sent a
                            messenger, according to established customs, to say to the consuls of
                            France, England, Italy, and Austria, that his envoy, General Kheridine,
                            would depart for Constantinople on Thursday, the 17th instant, and would
                            be pleased to take a letter of introduction to their respective
                            ministers accredited at the Sublime Porte. A courteous answer was
                            returned by the last three consuls named, while the French consul seized
                            the occasion to display his ill humor, expressing to the messenger his
                            astonishment that the Bey should venture to take such a step without
                            consulting him.</p>
                        <p>At 5 o’clock p. m. on the same day the French consul appeared at the
                            Bardo, and had an interview with the Bey in presence of his prime
                            minister and some subordinate officers. After the usual compliments, the
                            consul stated his objection to the proposed mission, and told the Bey
                            that such a measure could not receive his approbation or countenance. He
                            took to himself the credit of having recently extricated the Bey from
                            difficulty and embarrassment, by inducing the Ottoman envoy to leave his
                            capital, and suggested that if the Bey refused to heed his counsel he
                            might be left to take care of himself in future. Preserving his
                            self-possession and dignity, the Bey replied that neither the consul’s
                            countenance nor approbation was asked, and that he was notified of the
                            proposed mission simply as an act of courtesy. The Bey pronounced
                            counsel in such a case as out of place. Upon this the consul became more
                            imperious in his bearing, and protested in the name of his master, the
                            Emperor of the French, against the step which the Bey proposed to take.
                            Still, with apparent calmness, the Bey replied, that regarding himself
                            as an independent sovereign, he could accept no dictation from any
                            foreign representative. At the conclusion of his remarks, presuming from
                            the silence that the interview was ended, he reached out his hand as an
                            act of parting courtesy; whereupon the consul scornfully drew back from
                            the Bey, giving an unmistakable expression of disrespect.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the letters of introduction arrive from the other consuls
                            named, and it is decided that the envoy depart on Monday, the 14th
                            instant, instead of Thursday, the 17th. Towards evening on the 14th
                            instant the appointed envoy, General Kheridine, arrives, after visiting
                            the tomb of a Moslem saint on his way, at the Bey’s Goletta palace; when
                            forthwith appears the lieutenant of the French iron-clad Invincible, and
                            requests an interview. Being received, the lieutenant informs the
                            general that he was instructed by his commander to use his utmost
                            efforts to dissuade him from attempting to set out for Constantinople,
                            adding, as a final argument, that force would be employed, if necessary,
                            to prevent his departure. The general replied: “Be it so; I have
                            received my orders from my sovereign, and must obey them to the extent
                            of my ability. If the force which you threaten is employed, the
                            responsibility will not rest with me.” <pb facs="0485" n="461"
                                xml:id="pg_461"/> The lieutenant shortly afterwards signalled the
                            Invincible, and the fires were lighted to get up the steam. The general
                            was soon on board the Bey’s steamer the Bechir, whose steam was already
                            up, and at 8 o’clock he set out on his mission, tacking about so as to
                            avoid, as far as possible, approaching the Invincible. The commander of
                            the Invincible, observing this movement, turned his vessel to encounter
                            the Bechir, and signalled her to stop, employing a profusion of Bengal
                            lights to the amusement of large numbers upon the shore. But the Bey’s
                            steamer had the advantage of speed, and being light, was enabled to take
                            a short passage and so, after some hours of sailing, escaped further
                            pursuit. The commander of the Invincible was not prepared to take the
                            responsibility of using his cannon. The next morning his ship returned
                            to her place of anchor.</p>
                        <p>This affair has called forth a variety of inquiries and comments. What do
                            the French mean by such conduct? One reply is, that they mean to make
                            the Mediterranean a French lake and this is their way of attempting to
                            reach such a result. When such an idea is suggested, there is but one
                            feeling awakened aside from Frenchmen. “Never shall that be,” exclaimed
                            John Bull, and Aniens are utered on every hand. But the more common and
                            probable opinion is, that the French officials here are wanting in tact
                            and good sense, and that their folly is causing to their government
                            trouble and loss of influence. What seems most astonishing is to see
                            such pretensions set up without any adequate efforts on the part of the
                            French government either to justify and sustain them or to rebuke them.
                            French corsairs have come to be named in the same breath with those of
                            the confederates.</p>
                        <p>The Bey’s object in this mission is readily perceived. He designs to
                            express his gratitude to the Grand Sultan for having sent his ambassador
                            here in the time of trouble. While, with the example of Tripoli and
                            Egypt before him, he would shrink from the free embraces of his
                            religious superior, he is quite willing, by a system of coquetry, to
                            chill the troublesome amours of the French Emperor, and rebuke his
                            pretentious manners. And in this course of action he receives
                            encouraging expressions on every hand.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of despatches Nos. 10 and 11. My communication dated September
                            11 should have been numbered 49.</p>
                        <p>The Bey has recently organized a body-guard, composed of about 500 picked
                            men. On my visit at the Bardo, on the 22d instant, these troops appeared
                            out for the first time in a new zouave uniform. The epithet zouave is of
                            Arabic origin, and has been employed here from time immemorial to
                            indicate irregular troops. The Tunisian zouave uniform is of a brilliant
                            scarlet color, and differs otherwise considerably from that designated
                            by the same epithet in France and America. The Bey, dressed out in the
                            same style, was cheered by his troops, and after passing them in review
                            retired within his palace.</p>
                        <p>I afterwards had an extended conversation with the minister of foreign
                            affairs respecting the political positions and relations of Tunis with
                            other nations. I began by stating that though it is contrary to American
                            policy to take an active part in European politics, it is my duty to
                            obtain accurate information and communicate it to my government in
                            regard to passing events, and the solution of questions of national
                            interest. I then referred to the different views entertained <pb
                                facs="0486" n="462" xml:id="pg_462"/> in regard to the relations of
                            Tunis with Turkey, France and other nations. The minister’s reply was
                            substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>“We claim to be politically independent. The Beys of Tunis have been for
                            centuries untrammelled in their foreign relations and in their domestic
                            administration. They have made treaties with foreign powers, and foreign
                            representatives have been accredited directly to them, and the
                            representatives of our government have been in most cases received with
                            the same courtesy that we have shown. The actual Bey of Tunis is <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> independent, though <hi rend="italic">in
                                from</hi> he is yet subordinate to the Grand Sultan; but <hi
                                rend="italic">this form</hi> we maintain to be religious, not
                            political, in its character. The Sultan is the chief of the Moslem
                            hierarchy, and as such he is recognized and honored by the Bey. Prayers
                            are offered in his behalf in our mosques in connexion with the Bey, and
                            his name is stamped on our money, side by side with that of the Bey. The
                            Bey regards the Grand. Sultan as his religious superior, and desires to
                            maintain towards him the most grateful relation.”</p>
                        <p>The minister referred, in the course of his remarks, to the fact, that
                            though France has by her acts recognized the Bey<hi rend="smallcaps"/>
                            as an independent sovereign, her present consul has adopted a course of
                            action as if the Bey was a subordinate French subject. On the contrary,
                            though England refuses such a recognition of the Bey’s independence as
                            is implied by the formal reception at court of the* Bey’s envoys, still
                            her influence and bearing are in the main favorable to Tunisian
                            prosperity and independence. The British consul recognizes the authority
                            and competence of the Tunisian courts by himself appearing as a
                            plaintiff before them.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor of Austria has recently, as I learn from the Austrian
                            consul,. received an envoy of the Bey on two occasions, each time with
                            full honors,. though the ceremonies occurred at the Emperor’s palace,
                            just out of his capital, probably to avoid disturbing the
                            susceptibilities of the Sultan. Italy last year gave to the Bey a
                            decoration, such as is confined to independent sovereigns, but how the
                            Bey’s envoy was afterwards received I am unable to state. Since my
                            arrival here the Bey has sent an envoy twice to Madrid, and once to the
                            following places, viz: Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen, the Hague, and
                            Brussels, at each of which places the envoy was received with all the
                            honors that belong to a representative of an independent sovereign.
                            There is no question, so far as I know, in regard to the Bey’s being <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> an independent sovereign. Even the
                            English consul, who stoutly maintains for political reasons the
                            suzerainty of the Sultan, virtually yields this point, but opposes <hi
                                rend="italic">the formal</hi> Recognition of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >de facto</hi> independence until the Bey can have a satisfactory
                            guarantee of his separate existence. The impression is general here that
                            the progress of events tends towards the formal recognition of the Bey’s
                            independence, together with a guarantee of his possessions by the high
                            powers of Europe; and it is not improbable that the Sultan, seeing his
                            inability either to possess himself of Tunis, or to protect the Bey in
                            his possession of it, would readily assent to such an arrangement. It is
                            certain that the conduct of the Sultan towards the Bey during the
                            difficulties of the past season was friendly, and is now gratefully
                            remembered. The reasons for the Bey’s desiring to be recognized and
                            guaranteed as an independent neutral sovereign are numerous and
                            important. At present the jealousies between France, England and Italy
                            are such as to embarrass the government at every step. Whatever one
                            consul wants, the other two consuls are almost sure to oppose and

                            <p>This was the case of the prisoners now in jail at Liverpool charged
                                with piracy, and arrested and detained by order of the secretary of
                                state, at the instance of the American minister, for the purpose of
                                being delivered up to the United States under the act for enforcing
                                our extradition treaty with that country. It was admitted in the
                                argument that the general object and scope of that treaty arose out
                                of the fundamental maxim or principle of our law that “crime is
                                local,” and is triable only in the country, and even the county,
                                where it has been committed. On this subject the common law of
                                America—which is in fact our own—is of course the same, though there
                                is an exception, arising from another great principle of our law,
                                that allegiance over native-born subjects is not local, but attaches
                                its obligations to them wherever they are, from which it follows
                                that if a British subject commit a murder on a British subject in
                                America he could be tried and convicted here; and so in the converse
                                case of a murder here by an American subject on an American subject,
                                he could be tried in America. But if the crimes were not committed
                                both by and upon the subjects of the state assuming to try the
                                criminal, the case would not be so triable, and would only be
                                triable abroad where the crime was committed. <pb facs="0488"
                                    n="464" xml:id="pg_464"/> Such being the general principles of
                                common law and international law on the subject, in 1842 a treaty of
                                extradition was entered into which is recited in the act. That act
                                recites the treaty thus:</p>
                            <p>“That by the 10th article of the treaty of 1842 it was agreed that
                                the United States and her Majesty should, on mutual requisition by
                                them or their ministers, &amp;c., deliver up to justice persons who,
                                being charged with the crime of murder, piracy, robbery, arson, or
                                forgery, committed within the jurisdiction of either of the
                                contracting parties, should seek an asylum or be found within the
                                territories of the other: provided, that this should be only done
                                upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the
                                place where the fugitive person so charged should be found, would
                                justify his apprehension and commitment for trial for the crime
                                alleged to have been committed.”</p>
                            <p>And then the statute proceeds to enact—</p>
                            <p>“That in case of any requisition at any time made by the authorities
                                of the United States in pursuance of or according to the treaty for
                                the delivery of any persons charged with the crime of murder,
                                piracy, arson, robbery, or forgery, committed within the
                                jurisdiction of the United States of America, who shall be found
                                within the territory of her Majesty, it shall be lawful for one of
                                her Majesty’s secretaries of state, by warrant under his hand and
                                seal, to signify that such requisition has been so made, and to
                                require all justices of the peace, &amp;c, to govern themselves
                                accordingly, and to aid in apprehending the persons so accused, and
                                committing them to jail for the purpose of their being delivered up
                                to justice according to the treaty; and thereupon it shall be lawful
                                for any justice of the peace, &amp;c., in that part of her Majesty’s
                                dominions where the offenders shall be found, to examine upon oath
                                into the charge; and, upon such evidence as, according to the law of
                                that part of her Majesty’s dominions, would justify the apprehension
                                and committal for trial of the person so accused if the crime of
                                which he were accused had been committed there, to issue his warrant
                                for the apprehension of such persons and commit them to jail, there
                                to remain until delivered up in pursuance of the requisition. And
                                upon the certificate of such justice of the peace that the offender
                                has been so committed, it shall be lawful for one of the secretaries
                                of state, by warrant under his hand and seal, to order the person so
                                committed to be delivered up to such persons as shall be authorized
                                in the name of the United States to receive such persons so
                                committed, and convey them to the territory of the United States to
                                be tried for the crime of which they are accused, and thereupon they
                                shall be delivered up.”</p>
                            <p>It should be mentioned that, as was stated in the course of the
                                argument, the treaty was entered into as incidental to a treaty of
                                boundary, and one for the first time making, by the laws of both
                                countries, the slave trade piracy. It should also be here mentioned
                                that (as observed by the lord chief justice) the laws of the United
                                States and of this country are in this respect peculiar— that their
                                statute laws make certain acts piracy which would not be so by the
                                common law or the law of nations; as to which, or piracy <hi
                                    rend="italic">jure gentium,</hi> Sir Leoline Jenkins, a
                                celebrated admiralty judge of the last century, laid it down that it
                                is “justiciable” (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> amenable to justice,
                                or triable) in the courts of any country. And it is defined by
                                Wheaton as the offence of depredation on the high seas without being
                                authorized by any sovereign state. Further, it is to be borne in
                                mind that (as observed by Mr. Justice Shee) the statutes or peculiar
                                law of either country might have made certain acts piracy committed
                                within creeks or harbors not upon the high seas. And it was stated
                                that there are certain acts of Congress making acts piracy which
                                would not be piracy by the common law of either country or by the
                                law of nations. Such being the law upon the subject, the
                                circumstances under which the present case had arisen were these: In
                                November last an American schooner—the Gerrity—lay at Matamoras,
                                laden with a cargo of cotton, bound for New York. Some six or <pb
                                    facs="0489" n="465" xml:id="pg_465"/> more men—including the
                                prisoners—took passage on board, and embarked on board as
                                passengers. It was admitted that they went on board armed for the
                                very purpose of seizing the vessel, and under the command of one
                                Hogg, who assumed to be in the confederate service, and professed to
                                have papers from the confederate government, and under whose orders
                                they acted. The vessel left Matamoras on the 16th of November, and
                                at half past 12 on the night of the 17th the men thus embarked under
                                his orders rose upon the master and crew and seized the ship, cast
                                the master adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, and took the ship to
                                Belize, in the British Honduras, where it would appear they
                                abandoned the ship and sold the cargo, part of which had found its
                                way to Liverpool. In January last three of the men (two of whom were
                                British subjects) were found to be at Liverpool, and on the informal
                                ion of the master of the schooner, who also happened to be there,
                                Mr. Adams, the American minister, made a requisition to Sir George
                                Grey under the above act, and he thereupon issued his warrant to the
                                magistrates of Liverpool, under which they issued their warrants to
                                arrest the men, and they were accordingly so arrested, and were then
                                charged with piracy, on the evidence mainly of the master of the
                                ship seized, who distinctly stated that Hogg told him he had papers
                                to justify what he did, and that he was a major in the confederate
                                service, and that he (the master) believed him to be so, and he also
                                stated that the other men acted under his orders, and that when they
                                seized the ship they said they did so for the confederates; and that
                                Hogg spoke about Jefferson Davis. The statements of the prisoners
                                were likewise given in evidence, and were to the effect that they
                                were engaged by Major Hogg, of the confederate service, for the
                                purpose of seizing the ship, and that he showed them documents
                                signed by a General Bee, and stating that they were authorized by
                                Jefferson Davis to do so. Upon the evidence adduced before the
                                magistrate it was submitted, on the part of the prisoners, that the
                                act was not piracy, and not within the treaty. The magistrate (at
                                the suggestion of Mr. Justice Willes, at the assizes) remanded the
                                men from time to time, in order to allow of their making an
                                application to this court, the warrant for their committal
                                distinctly stating that they were committed, not for the purpose of
                                trial in this country, but of delivering up under the treaty.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Edward James, Q. C., (with him Mr. Littler and Mr. F. H. James,)
                                had, on behalf of the prisoners, obtained a rule <hi rend="italic"
                                    >nisi</hi> for a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> directed
                                to the jailer at Liverpool, for the purpose of bringing them up with
                                a view to their discharge, and now moved to make that rule
                                absolute.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush, Q. C., (with Mr. Milward and Mr. Lushington,) appeared to
                                show cause against the rule, instructed on behalf of the American
                                minister. “The question (he said) is, whether there is sufficient
                                evidence before the magistrate to justify him in committing the men
                                for trial.”</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. There is an antecedent question much more
                                important—whether the act applies where the offence is not
                                exclusively within the jurisdiction of the state making the
                                requisition? And are you not in this dilemma—that either this is not
                                piracy, (in which view the case, of course, is at an end) or, if it
                                is piracy, that it is cognizable by the courts of this country, and
                                so is not within the treaty of extradition? There appears to be the
                                great difficulty.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he was quite aware of it, and was prepared to meet it.
                                What was piracy? Wheaton defined it to be the offence of depredating
                                on the high seas without the authority of any sovereign power. That
                                was piracy <hi rend="italic">“jure gentium”</hi> by the common law
                                or by the law of nations. But, then, there was municipal piracy, or
                                piracy created only by municipal laws, and which would not be piracy
                                by the law of nations; and the word included both. Now, here the
                                facts showed a <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> case of piracy in
                                the larger sense—piracy by the law of nations. There was the
                                embarking on board as passengers, the seizure of the ship on the
                                seas, the casting the master adrift, the abandoning <pb facs="0490"
                                    n="466" xml:id="pg_466"/> of the ship, the sale of the cotton,
                                and the possession of articles belonging to the master and crew.
                                There is a charge of piracy under legal investigation; the
                                magistrate would be bound to hear further evidence; in point of
                                fact, further evidence could be adduced, the case is not closed, the
                                committal is not final.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. The real point is whether—assuming that it is
                                closed and is final—it is within the treaty. Whether the case is
                                closed and the committal is final can be raised on the return to the
                                writ.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush observed that two of the men were British subjects.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. That makes no difference upon the question,
                                however it may render them liable to the municipal law of their own
                                country for entering into a foreign service without their
                                sovereign’s leave. But if they, in point of fact, were in that
                                service, and seized the ship in the course of that service, is it
                                piracy?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. This is the question to be tried on the evidence.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. But there is the antecedent question whether,
                                even assuming the clearest case of piracy, it is within the treaty
                                as triable only in America.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush remarked that the vessel had been abandoned by the captors,
                                and the cargo sold.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. We know not under what circumstances—stress
                                of weather, or pursuit of hostile cruisers. But assume that it is
                                piracy—can you bring it within the treaty?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he would deal with that question. He admitted that no
                                doubt the general object of the treaty, as a treaty of extradition,
                                was the extradition of offenders from the country in which they were
                                found, and in which they could not be tried, to a country which
                                claimed them for the purpose of trial. Generally speaking, the
                                subjects of the treaty would be offences which could not be punished
                                elsewhere than in the country claiming the men. It was a general
                                principle that crime was local, and could only be tried in the
                                country where it was committed. But though this was so as to most
                                cases, it was otherwise as to piracy. That word was not in other
                                extradition treaties—for instance, it was not in the treaty with
                                France which proceeded only on crimes strictly local in their
                                character. And many of the crimes mentioned in the present treaty
                                are so. But there is the word “piracy” introduced into the American
                                treaty, a treaty between two great maritime countries. Now the word
                                comprised piracy <hi rend="italic">jure gentium</hi> and piracy by
                                municipal law, which may include acts not piratical by the common
                                law. Now piracy <hi rend="italic">jure gentium</hi> is defined to be
                                the committing of an act of depredation on the high seas which, if
                                committed on land, would be felony. And in that sense pirates were
                                deemed to be enemies of the human race, and triable and punishable
                                anywhere. By the general law of nations pirates in that sense may be
                                tried in any country in which they may be found. But there is also
                                piracy by municipal law, and there are acts punishable as piracy by
                                the law of the United States which are not so punishable in this
                                country. And the word “piracy” is used in both senses in this
                                treaty. Moreover, piracy, like murder, may be committed on board an
                                American ship, and if so, is within American jurisdiction. Murder
                                committed on board an American ship would be murder committed within
                                the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, just as murder
                                committed on board an English ship on an English subject would be
                                murder within the jurisdiction of the English courts. So, as to
                                piracy, even assuming it to be piracy <hi rend="italic">jure
                                    gentium,</hi> yet as being committed on board an American ship
                                it would be within the jurisdiction of the American courts; for a
                                ship is for legal purposes the soil or territory of the country to
                                which it belongs and piracy on board an American ship would be
                                piracy within American jurisdiction.</p>
                            <pb facs="0491" n="467" xml:id="pg_467"/>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. You are speaking of piracy <hi rend="italic"
                                    >jure gentium?</hi></p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. Yes.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor. That would be triable in the courts of this
                                country?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. Yes; but the statute does not apply merely to cases triable
                                exclusively in the American courts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. Surely the whole scope and scheme of an
                                extradition treaty applies it to offences not committed within the
                                jurisdiction of the courts of the country where the offender is
                                found. Is not that the sense and spirit of the treaty?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he could not admit it to be so.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice cited <hi rend="italic">Kent’s
                                    Commentaries</hi> (an American work) to the effect that such
                                treaties applied to crimes which could not be punished in the
                                country where the offender is found.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he had already admitted, arid he admitted again, that
                                the general object of the treaty was the extradition of offenders
                                who could not be tried in this country. But the offence of piracy
                                was peculiar and exceptional, and the word “piracy” in the act
                                embraces such a case as this.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. Is not the effect of piracy this—that by force
                                it overbears and destroys the nationality of the ship, so that it
                                necessarily, for that very reason, becomes a crime punishable in the
                                courts of any country?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush disputed this; otherwise the courts of this country might
                                claim to take cognizance of cases of piracy <hi rend="italic">jure
                                    gentium,</hi> within three miles of the American coast, and so
                                within the American dominion.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. That is a very different case from the
                                present.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. But if you once construe the term “piracy” to comprise
                                cases on board an American ship, it would equally include piracy in
                                American creeks or harbors within American dominion. Take the case
                                of murder; no one could doubt the treaty might embrace cases of
                                murder in which our courts might have jurisdiction. Suppose the case
                                of the murder of one English subject by another in the streets of
                                New York. Surely that would be within the act; yet the offender
                                could be tried either in America or in England.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Not in this country, except by virtue of
                                particular statutes to meet such cases.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. Do you say that if the courts of this country
                                were about to try a British subject for the murder of another
                                British subject in New York, it would be competent to the American
                                government to demand his delivery up?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. Certainly.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. If you could make that out, you would do a
                                great deal certainly.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. Would not such a case be the case of a crime committed
                                “within the jurisdiction” of the courts of the United States?</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. But surely the very case supposed is strong
                                to show that those words in the treaty must mean exclusive
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. There is no such word in it.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. But is not that so clearly the spirit and
                                scope of the treaty that it must be construed in that sense? Where
                                there is concurrent jurisdiction in the courts of both countries,
                                and the prisoner is in the custody of the courts of one country, can
                                it be contended that the treaty was intended to oust its
                                jurisdiction, and to enforce the delivery up of the prisoner merely
                                that he should be tried in the courts of the other country?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he so argued. Such, he insisted, was the bargain made
                                between the two countries, and they must both abide by it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. The “bargain” of the two countries is set
                                forth in the treaty itself, and does it not point to extradition in
                                cases of exclusive jurisdiction?</p>
                            <pb facs="0492" n="468" xml:id="pg_468"/>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Is not its scope and spirit this—to prevent
                                fugitive offenders escaping from justice?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee. The words are “seeking an asylum” in the country in
                                which they are found.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. That means merely that they are seeking to avoid trial, and
                                the words are, “seeking an asylum or found.” The learned gentleman
                                went on to argue that here the crime was committed within the
                                jurisdiction of the American courts, because it was committed on
                                board an American ship. He cited a case in our courts to show that
                                it had been held here that an English ship on the high seas is part
                                of the territory of England, and that a foreigner on board of such
                                ship is subject to our laws, and that therefore if he commits there
                                an act criminal by our law he may (by statute) be tried in our
                                courts.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice observed that the effect of this was merely
                                that by statute a British ship was made British territory for the
                                purposes of our own criminal law. It did not establish any general
                                principle of common or international law.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor remarked that the essence of piracy in the
                                common-law sense was that it was an offence not against any
                                particular nation, but against mankind in general.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. No doubt; but then it is an offence which must be committed
                                in some locality, and if committed on board an American ship there
                                is jurisdiction in the American courts; if on board a French or
                                English ship, then there is jurisdiction in the French or English
                                courts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn said he had derived from the American
                                authorities the impression that their view of the law was that the
                                effect of piracy was to overbear and destroy the nationality of the
                                vessel.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush said he thought otherwise, but he was aware that in a case
                                of the “United States <hi rend="italic">vs.</hi> Flintoff,” (5 <hi
                                    rend="italic">Wheaton’s Reports</hi>,) it was laid down that a
                                commission issued by a person as an officer of the Mexican republic,
                                or any unknown and unacknowledged state, would not authorize armed
                                vessels to capture vessels of belligerents, and it was also laid
                                down that a person acting with good faith, under circumstances
                                showing that the seizure was made <hi rend="italic">animo
                                    furandi,</hi> might be guilty of piracy.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn cited other cases in the same volume of <hi
                                    rend="italic">Wheaton’s Reports,</hi> showing that the American
                                view of the law was that the effect of an act of piracy in seizing a
                                vessel was to divest it of its nationality, and constitute a crime
                                equally punishable everywhere, as being piracy by the law of
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. There might be piracy without any actual seizure of the
                                vessel,</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. But that is not the present case. Here there
                                was certainly a seizure.</p>
                            <p>Mr. justice Mellor observed that the whole evidence showed that this
                                was the object.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush admitted again that piracy at common law was cognizable in
                                the courts of any country, but that did not make it, he urged, less
                                within the treaty. For if so, why was the word “piracy” introduced
                                at all? What effect of application would it have?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee observed that there might be piracy by statute in
                                some creek or harbor within the territorial jurisdiction of the
                                United States, or, as we should say in England, within the body of a
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. No doubt; and that is comprised in the word “piracy,” and
                                was meant to be included in the treaty; and so of piracy in an
                                American ship.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee. You lay down a very large proposition in saying
                                that a ship is the territory of the country to which it belongs. If
                                that were so, then how would it be lawful to go on board a ship to
                                take contraband of war?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. That is a justifiable right of war.</p>
                            <pb facs="0493" n="469" xml:id="pg_469"/>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee. It is not put on that ground. It is founded on the
                                fact that the ship on the high seas is not part of the territory of
                                the neutral.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. It is a right conceded to a belligerent, and is a
                                justification of what otherwise would be in the nature of a
                                trespass. On the same ground the right of search is not conceded
                                because the ship is deemed part of the territory; and what takes
                                place on board a ship is, therefore, within the territory, and so
                                within “the jurisdiction” of the country to which the ship
                                belongs.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee. Those words in the act may mean territorial or
                                local jurisdiction, or they mean that legal jurisdiction which by
                                our law is imposed upon its subjects, wherever they are, as a
                                consequence of allegiance. Here, however, they appear to mean
                                territorial jurisdiction, and they may have a sensible meaning in
                                that sense with reference to the laws of the United States without
                                resorting to the doctrine that a ship on the high seas is within the
                                jurisdiction of the country to which it belongs; for if a ship were
                                within a creek or haven of the United States the act would be piracy
                                by the American statutes, and it may be that the words have that
                                meaning.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn cited <hi rend="italic">Kent’s
                                    Commentaries</hi> to show that it was of no importance on whom
                                or where a piratical offence is committed, as the pirate may by the
                                laws of all countries be tried in any country where he is found.</p>
                            <p>Sir. Lush contended that, nevertheless, the case was within the
                                act.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Shee observed that the words “deliver up to justice”
                                surely meant that the case was one in which the offence would not be
                                triable unless the prisoner was delivered up.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor. The object is to prevent an escape from
                                justice.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush urged that the country on whose ship the piracy had been
                                committed had a greater interest in trying it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor. But it would not try it more impartially than we
                                should.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. Nor less so, I hope.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor. No, nor less so; but then there is not, that I
                                can see, any balance of convenience or “interest” in favor of the
                                trial in America. The trial can be had quite as effectually
                                here.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. There may be no prosecutor.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. Here it appears that there is, and there have
                                been preliminary proceedings.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. It may be that the proofs may be given with more facility
                                in this country.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. You yourself must argue that a case has been
                                or may be made out against the prisoners here.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. A <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> case; but we should
                                have to bring over witnesses from America. There is no limitation as
                                to British subjects, and there can be no doubt that we should be
                                bound to deliver up British subjects under this act. The American
                                government would not enter into a treaty of extradition with a
                                stipulation excepting British subjects from its operation. The
                                learned counsel then went on to argue that there might be a charge
                                of piracy under the municipal law of America cognizable only in the
                                courts of that country.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. But here there is one state of facts, and it
                                is all one case, and it is all equally piracy.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. And if the men are delivered up on the minor
                                charge there can be no doubt that they would be tried upon the
                                other.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. There was the act of robbery on the high seas,
                                independently of the seizure of the ship, and that by the American
                                law is piracy.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. But we cannot disguise from ourselves that
                                the real offence was the seizure of the ship.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Mellor. All the evidence shows that such was the object
                                of the men and the real character of the act.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. And it is either piracy <hi rend="italic">jure
                                    gentium</hi> or nothing. If <pb facs="0494" n="470"
                                    xml:id="pg_470"/> it was justified as the act of a belligerent,
                                it is nothing. If it is not so justified it is piracy. It was all
                                one entire act.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush then argued that, at all events, in any view, the men were
                                liable to be tried here, and so could not be discharged.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. But the warrants show that they are not
                                detained for trial in this country, but for the purpose of delivery
                                up to the American authorities.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush Still they ought not to be discharged, as they might be
                                properly detained.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice Suppose we are of opinion that the effect of
                                the treaty is not to oust the courts of this country of their
                                jurisdiction, there is no right to detain the men for the purpose of
                                delivering them up to the American authorities; and it would be too
                                late if we waited until they were actually about to be delivered
                                over.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lush. That would depend on the secretary of state.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. This warrant issues as a matter of course if
                                the men are once committed to be delivered up.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Justice Blackburn. If the men are really detained for trial in
                                this country that would be a good return to the writ of <hi
                                    rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>. But nothing in the case shows
                                that that is so.</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice. And if the men are illegally detained, as the
                                matter now stands, they are entitled to be discharged.</p>
                            <p>After some further discussion, the learned judges went out to
                                consider of their decision, and on their return,</p>
                            <p>The Lord Chief Justice said, we are of opinion that the rule should
                                be made absolute. We do not desire, at the present stage of the
                                case, to express any decision as to the construction of the statute;
                                but we think that, in a matter of so much importance in an
                                international point of view, it is desirable that we should have
                                before us all the materials on which to form our judgment on
                                authoritative grounds. We therefore think it better that the rule
                                for a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> should be made
                                absolute.</p>
                            <p>The rule will be argued next term, which begins on the 23d
                                instant.</p>
