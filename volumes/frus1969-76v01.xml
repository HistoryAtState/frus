                        Volume I</ref>, Foundations of Foreign Policy, 1969-1972. Previous <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes have focused on the formulation
                    of major foreign policy initiatives, implementation of policy decisions, and
                    significant diplomatic activity. This volume is the first in the series to step
                    back from the foreign policy process and examine in detail the intellectual
                    assumptions that U.S. foreign affairs leaders used to make sense of the world
                    and to frame their basic policies. Therefore, the documents selected are
                    necessarily a sampling chosen to illustrate policy perspectives and deeply held
                    assumptions, rather than a thorough record of a bilateral relationship, a major
                    issue, or a foreign policy crisis. Although all key officials receive attention,
                    the volume focuses on the worldviews of the two main architects of foreign
                    policy during the first administration of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M.
                        Nixon</persName>: the President and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A.
                        Kissinger</persName>, his Assistant for National Security Affairs. Using
                    previously unpublished records, drawn primarily from the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials and the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress,
                    along with published sources, the volume chronicles the basic
                    assumption—realism—that both <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                        Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                    used in formulating foreign policy. The source material differs from other
                    Foreign Relations volumes. It includes articles written by <persName

                        >Henry Kissinger</persName> before they were in office, background briefings
                    of the press by “senior officials,” Secretary of State <persName

                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, other administration officials'
                    interaction with Congress, major speeches and addresses by <persName

                    the type of documents more traditionally found in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi>: memoranda, letters, telegrams, and records of meetings. The
                    volume takes the entire foreign policy record of the first <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration as its canvas, but
                    highlights the concepts of linkage and triangular diplomacy that they employed
                    to achieve détente, Vietnamization, and other foreign policy objectives. It
                    reveals the principals' concerns about American credibility, multipolarity, and
                    the strains on U.S. power, while tracing the development of such ideas as the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to meet those
                    perceived challenges.</p>

                <p>The field of U.S. diplomatic history has undergone dramatic changes in recent
                    years, broadening its scope to encompass cultural relations. The Foreign
                    Relations of the United States series is similarly moving in new and innovative
                    directions. Previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes focused on
                    the major decisions and diplomatic activity of U.S. foreign policymakers. This
                    volume-“Foundations of Foreign Policy, 1969-1972”-is the first in the series to
                    document one aspect of the cultural approach: the intellectual assumptions that
                    U.S. foreign affairs leaders used to make sense of the world and frame policy.
                    Although other key officials receive attention, the volume carefully details the
                    worldviews of the two architects of foreign policy during the first
                    administration of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>: the
                    president and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName>, his
                    assistant for national security affairs. Using previously unpublished records
                    along with published sources, it chronicles the basic premise-realism-that both
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> used in mentally ordering the world and
                    in formulating policy. It also highlights the theoretical mechanisms-linkage and
                    triangular diplomacy-they employed to achieve Vietnamization, détente, and other
                    objectives. It reveals the principals' worries about multipolarity, U.S. power,
                    and American credibility, while tracing their mental construction of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to meet those
                    perceived challenges.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>' s foreign policy views did not spring de novo into
                    their heads in January 1969. Rather, they both arrived on the job with a wealth
                    of ideas about international affairs developed throughout years of practical and
                    theoretical experience in the field. The volume begins by documenting those
                    worldviews in articles, essays, and campaign speeches written or given by
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> during the 2-year period prior to their assumption of
                    office.</p>
                <p>Realism, the most important of the principals' initial assumptions, influenced
                    policy throughout the administration. For <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>, among the most influential thinkers in the history of
                    U.S. diplomacy, the concept of balance-of-power was a shibboleth. A proper
                    balance, attained only if the great powers resisted the temptation to jockey for
                    tactical advantage, created a stabilizing equilibrium, he argued. The former
                    Harvard professor also believed that national interests (rather than ideals)
                    measured in terms of security and power (military, economic, political, and
                    psychological) should govern both international affairs and U.S. foreign policy.
                    According to an important 1968 essay, in which he expressed his overall
                    worldview, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> realized that
                    Americans, accustomed to thinking in terms of such ideals as peace or freedom,
                    were uncomfortable defining power and interests as the bases of their foreign
                    policies and objectives. Nevertheless, he argued, the United States should
                    pursue its global “interests”-a key word in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration' s foreign political lexicon-rather than
                    “altruism.” Before doing so, however, American decisionmakers first needed to
                    reach a “mature conception” of foreign policy by clearly defining the nation' s
                    interests and objectives and then by matching its capabilities and commitments
                    to those interests and objectives. (4, 118) On those grounds, realism led
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to be particularly critical
                    of President <persName>Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>' s involvement in Vietnam,
                    which the national security advisor felt was peripheral to U.S. security.
                    (81)</p>
                <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was no stranger to power
                    politics or international affairs, the volume documents his evolving realist
                    thought. Earlier in his career, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                    >Nixon</persName>-first as a Congressman and then as vice president under Dwight
                    D. Eisenhower-had been a devout anti-communist and cold warrior who saw the
                    world through an ideological lens. But he converted to realism as president, a
                    transition most clearly revealed in his conversation with Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse</persName>-tung during his historic first visit
                    to the People' s Republic of China (<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>) in
                    February 1972. Within the context of calming <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1"
                        >Mao</persName>' s concerns about the U.S. military presence in Asia and
                    elsewhere, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> explained that, as a
                    Quaker, he was philosophically opposed to a large military establishment and
                    “military adventures.” Since becoming commander-in-chief, however, he had found
                    it necessary “to put the survival of his nation first.” As <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> told bipartisan Congressional leaders
                    after his return to Washington, that reordering of priorities had led him to
                    explore relations with communist China, with which the United States shared a
                    “common interest” that trumped the two states' ideological differences. (106,
                    108) Realism provided the intellectual rationale not only for the
                    administration' s approach to the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, but also
                    for its disinclination to promote democracy abroad, a mission usually associated
                    with Wilsonian idealism. (2, 3, 4, 53) Similar thinking peppered the president'
                    s public discourse, including a nationally televised address he gave at the end
                    of his first term. Listing his administration' s accomplishments, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> highlighted the creation of a “structure
                    of peace” with the two communist powers-China and the Soviet Union-that rested
                    “on the hard concrete of common interests and mutual agreements, and not on the
                    shifting sands of naïve sentimentality.” (123, 18)</p>
                <p>Before the realist <hi rend="italic"> Weltanschauung</hi> of <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> could function, policymakers needed to analyze, plan, and
                    identify the nation' s capabilities, interests, and objectives. Since
                    bureaucratization hindered the thoughtful, yet agile, approach to statecraft
                    favored by the president and his national security advisor, reforming the
                    policymaking process emerged as one of their key goals. As the secrecy
                    surrounding <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>' s trips to Peking
                    in July 1971 and to Moscow in March 1972 suggest, reform often meant
                    centralizing foreign policymaking, placing decisions almost entirely in the
                    hands of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and his national security
                    advisor. (102, 110) Before being named to his post, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> argued that bureaucracy paralyzed U.S. policymakers by
                    widening the array of available policy options even as it limited the capacity
                    of statesmen, increasingly distracted by administrative responsibilities, to
                    choose among them. (4) Both <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> numbered reforming the foreign
                    policymaking apparatus among the key accomplishments of their first years in
                    office. The administration, they claimed, had created a “a new way of making
                    decisions” by making the National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss>), rather than the Department of State, the main body
                    responsible for advising the president on foreign affairs. The smaller, more
                    agile <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> could plan, analyze, and review all
                    foreign policy options systematically and quickly, providing a clearer picture
                    of the way ahead. Specialized groups within the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss>-such as the Senior Review Group and the Defense Program Review
                    Committee-reviewed policy, prepared contingency plans, or brought other matters,
                    including defense, more fully within the White House' s grasp. (47) <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> confidently declared that-unlike past
                    administrations that allegedly had lacked a clear sense of purpose, merely had
                    responded to crises, and had become unnecessarily embroiled in conflicts-“we
                    know where we are going.” (104)</p>
                <p>Realism provided <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> with an understanding of geostrategy
                    and a negotiating approach that fueled their pursuit of détente with the Soviet
                    Union. Common wisdom within the administration held that the Sino-Soviet split,
                    Soviet-American strategic parity, and certain challenges facing the Kremlin
                    within its own sphere of influence had combined to create a situation in which a
                    lessening of Cold War tensions was in the interest of both nations. (2, 8, 41)
                    Signaling his desire to negotiate, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    announced in his inaugural address what would become an oft-repeated theme of
                    his administration: the world was moving from “a period of confrontation” and
                    “entering an era of negotiation.” (9) Unlike past administrations, which had
                    pursued agreements with the Soviets merely to lessen tensions or improve the
                    atmosphere of superpower relations, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> assumed that
                    Soviet-American interests differed and instead sought to negotiate only in those
                    areas where it was in their mutual interest to do so. For example, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> told French President <persName
                        corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles de Gaulle</persName>, during a private
                    conversation held in Paris in early 1969, that he had little interest in talking
                    with the Soviets merely to reduce mistrust. Instead, “we should be hard and
                    pragmatic in dealing with the Soviets. They knew what they wanted and we must
                    know what we want.” (13, 10) The president repeated that position on several
                    occasions, including an address to the United Nations in October 1970, in which
                    he stated that détente depended upon a mutual recognition of power and national
                    interest. “[P]ower has a role in our relations,” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> reminded his listeners. “Power is a fact of international
                    life.” (78, 47, 52, 60) Similarly, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>, in a speech before the Business Council in December
                    1971, argued that Americans mistakenly assumed that tensions with the Soviets
                    were due to “mere personal misunderstandings and that the remedy for national
                    differences is the development of interpersonal good will.” The <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration would not make the mistake
                    of confusing “foreign policy with psychotherapy. What we want to do is deal with
                    concrete issues in our relationships.” (101)</p>
                <p>Détente produced dramatic results in May 1972 with the Moscow Summit, where the
                    United States and the Soviet Union signed the first Strategic Arms Limitation
                    agreement (<gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>). (97, 114, 116, 117) At the
                    summit, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> again articulated his
                    administration' s approach to the Soviets. Acknowledging their differing systems
                    and global interests, he told his hosts that a superpower condominium could not
                    be achieved by “mushy sentimentality or by glossing over differences which
                    exist. We can do it only by working out real problems in a concrete fashion,
                    determined to place our common interests above our differences.” (115) Upon his
                    return to Washington, the president reiterated this worldview to his Cabinet and
                    White House staff, reminding them that “fundamental shifts in the world balance
                    of power,” rather than “woolly-headed idealism,” had produced the Moscow Summit
                    and <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. (119)</p>
                <p>Triangular diplomacy and linkage provided tactical models to achieve the
                    interests identified by realist analysis. Based on balance-of-power theory,
                    triangular diplomacy involved using relations with one country as leverage to
                    extract concessions from another. The deepening Sino-Soviet split and the
                    emergence of China as a global power presented the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration with an opportunity to establish relations
                    with the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> which, by serving as a
                    counterweight to the Soviet Union, would provide additional leverage for
                    extracting concessions from Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> typically provided the most detailed and nuanced
                    explanation of triangular diplomacy to <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> magazine
                    correspondents in December 1970. Given the Sino-Soviet border conflict, he
                    explained, the Soviets had an interest in dealing with the United States so as
                    “to free their Western rear so that they can focus more on China.” And the
                    United States could guarantee itself a maximum amount of leverage vis-à-vis
                    Moscow simply by putting out “the word that we are restudying the China
                    question.” The administration' s emerging China strategy was “to develop a
                    dialogue with them [the Chinese] for its own sake and then to have a
                    counterweight with the Soviets.” (80, 24, 55) With those goals in mind,
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> came to office determined to
                    pursue an opening to China. In April 1969, Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName> announced at an Associated
                    Press luncheon that the administration was ready to establish “normal relations”
                    with China and would be “responsive” to any friendly overtures from Peking. (21,
                    14)</p>
                <p>Triangular diplomacy paid dividends immediately after the July 1971 announcement
                    that <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would visit China, a
                    breakthrough made possible by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'
                    s secret visit to Peking that month. (92, 93) The national security advisor
                    discovered that playing the “China card” had worked its magic during his first
                    meeting with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoly
                        Dobrynin</persName> following the announcement. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                        >Dobrynin</persName>, who <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    found “totally insecure,” conveyed the Kremlin' s suddenly renewed interest in a
                    proposed U.S.-Soviet summit that was eventually held in Moscow in May 1972. (94)
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> typically placed triangular
                    diplomacy within a broad concept of geostrategy during a meeting in the Oval
                    Office held just days before the president' s trip to China, a discussion
                    recorded on the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> tapes. “For the
                    next 15 years we have to lean toward the Chinese against the Russians. We have
                    to play this balance of power game totally unemotionally. Right now, we need the
                    Chinese to correct the Russians, and to discipline the Russians.” (105)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> similarly characterized
                    triangular diplomacy. (97, 107, 119)</p>
                <p>Closely related to triangular diplomacy was linkage, another intellectual
                    foundation for the administration' s statecraft. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    believed that linkage-making negotiating progress in one area with the Soviet
                    Union dependant upon progress in another-provided the best tactic for achieving
                    several key international goals, including détente, strategic arms control,
                    ending the war in Vietnam, and reaching settlements in the Middle East and
                    Berlin. The president defined linkage in a letter to Secretary of Defense
                        <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin Laird</persName> soon after his
                    inauguration. Theorizing that “the great issues are fundamentally interrelated,”
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wrote, “we must seek to advance
                    on a front at least broad enough to make clear that we see some relationship
                    between political and military issues.” The Soviets, he continued, “should be
                    brought to understand that they cannot expect to reap the benefits of
                    cooperation in one area while seeking to take advantage of tension or
                    confrontation elsewhere.” (10) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    similarly defined linkage for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The
                    administration, he stated, “sought to move forward across a broad range of
                    issues so that progress in one area would add momentum to the progress of other
                    areas.” (118)</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> went to great lengths to link progress on détente and
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> to the Kremlin' s willingness to press
                    its client in Hanoi to negotiate an end to the fighting in Vietnam. (11, 12, 13,
                    25) The president and his national security advisor stressed this connection in
                    their private discussions with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                    and Soviet foreign minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei A.
                        Gromyko</persName>. (77) During an October 1969 meeting with <persName
                        corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in the Oval Office, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> explained that, if the Soviet Union did “something in
                    Vietnam” that led to an acceptable peace settlement, “the U.S. might do
                    something dramatic to improve” bilateral relations. (40) As the volume shows,
                    however, in March 1972, less than two months before the planned Moscow Summit,
                    North Vietnam launched an offensive, largely supplied by the Soviet Union, that
                    severely jeopardized the administration' s linkage strategy. (110, 112, 113)
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> decided during a telephone conversation to threaten to
                    abort the summit if the Kremlin failed to pressure Hanoi to halt its campaign
                    and negotiate in earnest. As <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> put
                    it, their approach was to “keep kicking them [the Soviets] in the balls.”
                    (109)</p>
                <p>As it applied to Vietnam, linkage complemented the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Doctrine, the president' s intellectual response to the
                    war and shifts in the global balance of power. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>, who hinted at such a concept on the campaign trail,
                    articulated the doctrine during a background briefing for reporters in Guam,
                    where he had traveled in July 1969 to witness the splashdown of the Apollo
                    astronauts. (3, 5, 29) Refined over the next several months, the doctrine held
                    that, while the United States would honor its treaty obligations and continue to
                    extend its nuclear shield to allies, it would come to its allies' defense only
                    in the event of an invasion by a major power and only if doing so was in its own
                    interest. Instead, Washington would encourage Asian nations to be responsible
                    for their own defense. (32, 34, 37, 69)</p>
                <p>Vietnamization, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Southeast Asia
                    accompanied by Saigon' s assumption of responsibility for its own defense, was
                    “an application of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to
                    South Vietnam,” according to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.
                    (69) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, for whom ending the unpopular
                    war in Vietnam was a top diplomatic priority, argued for shifting the burden of
                    fighting to the South Vietnamese in a campaign speech in October 1968. The South
                    Vietnamese should “fight their own battles,” he declared. (7) <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> agreed, informing the annual luncheon of
                    the Associated Press in 1969 that the White House was “deeply engaged…in an
                    intensive program of upgrading” South Vietnam' s military capabilities. (21)</p>
                <p>A reaction to the quagmire in Vietnam, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Doctrine also represented an attempt to harmonize the
                    United States' still vast global interests and commitments with its declining
                    capabilities and the emergence of a multipolar world order. <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>, who assumed that the United States was moving from a
                    position of “predominance to one of partnership,” used the doctrine to promote
                    self-sufficiency among U.S. allies in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. (41, 58,
                    101) However, the doctrine' s tools-including foreign aid, strategic assistance
                    programs, and regional alliances-also sought to contain nationalism,
                    independence, and self-reliance within an American dominated network of
                    interdependent relationships. (37, 85, 89, 90) According to <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, U.S. aid and assistance programs
                    were designed to develop “a world order in which the United States does not have
                    to carry the entire burden. This means relating individual countries to others
                    in their regions and then relating them to the United States.” (35)</p>
                <p>As the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine suggests, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>' s perception that the architecture of international
                    power had shifted served as yet another intellectual backdrop against which they
                    crafted policy. The economies of Western Europe, Germany, and Japan, all crushed
                    by World War II, had fully healed. The communist world had split between the
                    Soviet Union and China, a burgeoning power. New nations in the Middle East,
                    Asia, Africa, and Latin America had emerged. The end result: the bipolar
                    structure of the Cold War, in which only two superpowers held a preponderance of
                    power, had given way to a multipolar system. Several documents in the volume
                    illustrate the principals' understanding of this change. (84, 104) As early as
                    July 1967, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> informed a gathering of
                    conservatives at San Francisco' s Bohemian Club, “We live in a new world.” (2)
                    One year later, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> identified
                    “political multipolarity” as a new feature of the global scene. (4) After the
                    inauguration, a study by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff concluded
                    that a “diffusion of independent political activity” had replaced bipolarity.
                    (41)</p>
                <p>Even as the poles of international power proliferated, <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>' s foreign policy team became convinced
                    that the United States was mired in relative economic, military, and even
                    psychological decline, an assumption that profoundly shaped the administration'
                    s foreign policies. The Soviet Union, having occupied a position of inferiority
                    since the dawn of the nuclear age, finally had achieved rough strategic parity
                    with the United States. (71) In addition, a worsening economy, heightened
                    demands for domestic spending, and post-Vietnam criticism of the military left
                    little room for spending on defense or foreign aid. Concerned by the budgetary
                    crisis, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> and
                    Undersecretary of State <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliott
                        Richardson</persName> worried that the United States no longer possessed
                    resources sufficient to conduct a robust foreign policy. (82, 46)</p>
                <p>Disenchantment with Vietnam not only put pressure on defense budgets, it also
                    fueled a sense among the public and Congress that the United States was
                    over-committed abroad. The movement to narrow America' s overseas obligations
                    troubled <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>' s foreign policymakers
                    insofar as they assumed that it could lead to a “new isolationism.” (39, 41) The
                    president attacked “new isolationists” in a commencement address given at the
                    Naval Officer Candidate School in March 1971, in which he equated assaults on
                    U.S. military budgets and overseas commitments with “weakness.” (87) The next
                    month, he told Republican Congressional leaders that calls for a rollback in the
                    U.S. posture represented a grave “danger to peace” as the proposed withdrawal
                    would only weaken the United States, encourage adversaries, and “invite a large
                    war.” (88) In short, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration was the first to confront “Vietnam syndrome,” Americans' postwar
                    unwillingness to play a forceful global role. (85, 86, 101) That condition
                    shaped the administration' s strategy in Vietnam. On several occasions,
                    including during a May 1969 conversation with Singapore' s prime minister,
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> expressed his fear that a too
                    rapid U.S. “bug-out” from Vietnam would foster a sense of national failure that
                    would in turn produce “isolation.” (20, 23, 27, 38, 75)</p>
                <p>In <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>' s estimation, post-Vietnam
                    retrenchment, parity, and shrinking military budgets had combined to create a
                    perception of U.S. weakness that led friends and foes alike to question
                    Washington' s credibility. (36) Worried that Vietnamization was further eroding
                    America' s reputation, in October 1969 he sent <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> a study arguing that the nation' s “deteriorating
                    strategic position” discouraged allies, who increasingly viewed the United
                    States as “a reluctant giant.” (39) Conversely, the perception of American
                    impotence encouraged adversaries, emboldening the Soviet Union to be provocative
                    and challenge the United States. (71, 72) Such concerns, harbored also by
                        <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, led policymakers to try to end the war
                    in Vietnam in such a way as to maintain the integrity of South Vietnam and
                    thereby enhance U.S. credibility. (42, 67) The president, in a meeting with
                    Republican Congressional leaders, made the case for a measured withdrawal from
                    Vietnam that would leave an impression of U.S. strength necessary to facilitate
                    a “modus vivendi” with the communist powers and to defend Washington' s Asian
                    allies. Alluding to the domino theory, the president sensed that the
                    Philippines, South Korea, and Japan would “lose confidence in us…if we leave
                    [Vietnam] precipitously.” (88) Policymakers connected credibility, Vietnam, the
                    domino theory, and even détente on several other occasions. (17, 67, 71, 87, 91,
                    101) In June 1972, for instance, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    informed his Cabinet and White House staff that only U.S. military strength,
                    which created the impression of power, had made such breakthroughs as the Moscow
                    Summit, <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, and the opening of China
                    possible. However, the United States would surrender its credibility, he
                    explained, if it lost ingloriously in Vietnam. Summarizing his thinking,
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> concluded, “If they think we
                    are weak, they are going to pounce on us. If they think we are strong, they are
                    going to deal with us.” (119)</p>
                <p>The intellectual foundations, including concerns about U.S. credibility, upon
                    which the president, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and other
                    principals built foreign policy prepared the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration to achieve some notable diplomatic
                    achievements. Realism, linkage, and triangular diplomacy helped produce
                        détente,<gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, and an opening to China. The
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, meant to respond to
                    multipolarity and relative U.S. decline, helped pave the way toward
                    Vietnamization, which culminated in temporary peace in Vietnam in 1973. While
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> achieved notable successes in
                    his first term, the legacy of Vietnam, both domestic and foreign, confronted
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during his second term and
                    Gerald R. Ford, his successor, with serious foreign policy challenges. <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches,
                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying
                    specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series
                    were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this volume, which is a departure from previous volumes published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, is to document the
                    intellectual foundations of the foreign policy of the first <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. Previous volumes have
                    been compiled to meet the legislatively mandated standard that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series shall be “a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable documentary record of major United States foreign policy decisions
                    and significant diplomatic activity.” This volume is unique in that it explores
                    the collective mind-set of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration on foreign policy issues rather than documenting foreign policy
                    decisions or diplomatic exchanges. It takes as its canvas the entire record of
                    the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. Therefore
                    the documents selected are necessarily a sampling chosen to illustrate policy
                    perspectives and themes, rather than a thorough record of a bilateral
                    relationship or of a major issue. A measure of the departure of this volume from
                    previous volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is the
                    extent to which it draws upon the published record of speeches, press releases,
                    press conferences and briefings, interviews, and testimony before Congressional
                    committees to document policy positions and the assumptions of administration
                    officials on the foreign policy process.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had a strong interest in
                    foreign policy and he and his assistant for National Security Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> managed many of the more
                    important aspects of foreign policy from the White House. <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> shared a well-defined general perception of world
                    affairs. The editors of the volume sought to present a representative selection
                    of documents chosen to develop the primary intellectual themes that ran through
                    and animated the administration's foreign policy. The documents selected focus
                    heavily upon the perspectives of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> but also include those of
                    Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, Secretary of
                    Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>, Under Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and others.</p>
                <p>In a volume that explores the administration's intellectual assumptions on a
                    variety of issues, three principal themes emerge. During a stop on Guam in July
                    1969, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> articulated what
                    would become known as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine.
                    Conditioned by the experience of Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> defined a more limited role for the United States in
                    potential future conflicts. He stated “that as far as the problems of military
                    defense, except for the threat of a major power involving nuclear weapons, the
                    United States is going to encourage and has the right to expect that this
                    problem will be handled by, and responsibility for it taken by, Asian nations
                    themselves.” The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine was
                    subsequently expanded to apply to all allies of the United States. A second
                    foreign policy theme that runs through the record of the first <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration is that of linkage, the
                    concept of linking progress on foreign <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"
                    />policy issues in dealing with the Soviet Union. Triangular diplomacy, the
                    third theme developed in the volume, involved balancing relations with the
                    Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Triangular diplomacy embraced
                    the assumptions underlying the diplomatic opening to China and the Moscow summit
                    in 1972.</p>

                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed with headings, source notes, and number
                    of pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear
                    in the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"

                    summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and elucidate
                    the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other first-hand
                    accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate the official
                    record.</p>

                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the

                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for

                    of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials,
                    since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal
                    materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and implementing public access
                    regulations require NARA formally to notify the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review for the State Department of the documents published in this volume. The
                    review was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in Executive
                    Order 12958 on Classified National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 2001 and was
                    completed in 2002, resulted in the decision to withhold minor excisions in two
                    documents; no documents were withheld in full. The editors are confident, on the
                    basis of the research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the
                    declassification review process described above, that the documentation and
                    editorial notes presented here provide an undiluted record of the intellectual
                    foundations of the foreign policy of the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department's indexed central files through
                    July 1973 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department's
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering the 1969-1976 period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or

                    and other White House foreign policy records, including tape recordings of

                <p>Access to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House tape
                    recordings is governed by the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials
                    Preservation Act (P.L. 93-526; 88 Stat. 1695) and an access agreement with the
                    Office of Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> estate. In
                    February 1971 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> initiated a
                    voice activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and,
                    subsequently, in the President's Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp <persName>David</persName>
                    telephones. The audiotapes include conversations of President <persName

                    Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, other White

                    other Cabinet officers, members of Congress, and key foreign officials. The
                    clarity of the voices on the tape recordings is often very poor, but the editors
                    made every effort to verify the accuracy of the transcripts that they prepared
                    of the recorded conversations. Readers are urged to consult the recordings for a
                    full appreciation of those aspects of the discussions that cannot be fully
                    captured in a transcription, such as the speakers' inflections and emphases that
                    may convey nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of the
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                    Materials Project. While all the material printed in this volume has been
                    declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Staff is
                    processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this volume, but they
                    may not be available in their entirety at the time of publication.</p>

                <p>Research for this volume was undertaken by a team of ten historians, two of whom

                <p>Much of the record included in the volume was drawn from public sources. Speeches
                    and policy statements were garnered from a number of sources, the most important

                        >Nixon</persName> very occasionally provided a background briefing as well.
                    These documents were not classified but they were not <pb n="XIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0013"/>made public in order to protect the identities
                    of those giving the briefings. The background briefings can be found in the
                    Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> Papers, Subject File, Boxes CL 425-426.</p>
                <p>Among the classified sources consulted, the most useful were found in the
                    Presidential papers and other White House records maintained by the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project. In the
                    White House Special Files, the President's Office Files contain many of the
                    records used in the volume of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                    meetings with foreign leaders. The Office Files also include <persName
                        corresp="#p_BP1">Patrick Buchanan</persName>'s summaries of <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s meetings with leaders of Congress on
                    foreign policy issues. In the National Security Council Files, the Agency Files,
                    the Subject Files, the President's Trip Files, and the Presidential/HAK Memcons
                    were particularly useful. The agency files for the National Security Council and
                    the Department of State contain thoughtful assessments of the foreign policy
                    process. The Subject Files include memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> as
                    well as memoranda of conversation involving <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> and the President. The President's Trip Files contain
                    the very valuable memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                    >Kissinger</persName>'s conversations with Soviet Ambassador <persName
                        corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoly Dobrynin</persName>. Among the most productive of
                    the files researched of those maintained by the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project were the National Security
                    Council Secretariat Files pertaining to the annual reports on foreign policy
                    that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> submitted to
                    Congress beginning on February 18, 1970. The reports grew out of wide-ranging
                    conceptual analysis, only some of which could be included in the volume. These
                    files can be found in boxes 1303-1309 of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Project's <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> collection.
                    Boxes 325-328 contain <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, Subject Files,
                    which also include material on The President's Annual Review of Foreign Policy,
                    1970-1972.</p>
                <p>Of the files of the Department of State's Secretariat, the most useful for the
                    purposes of this volume were the conference files and the Head of State
                    correspondence. The Senior Review Group of the National Security Council
                    conducted reviews of major foreign policy issues. The records of the Senior
                    Review Group were consulted at the National Security Council before they were
                    transferred to the National Archives. They are now housed in the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials, <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Institutional Files (H-Files).</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers at the Library of
                    Congress include records of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                    telephone conversations. Boxes 359-375 contain a chronological file of
                    transcripts of conversations covering the period 1969-1972. Boxes 394-395
                    comprise the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> file of telephone
                    conversations, including <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                    conversations with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                        >Dobrynin</persName> and Chargé Vorontsov. Boxes 396-397 contain transcripts
                    of conversations tape-recorded at <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>'s residence. The <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV"
                        facs="0014"/>entire collection is invaluable for the light it sheds on the
                    full range of foreign policy issues dealt with by the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. There are few instances
                    in the collection, however, of broad, conceptual exchanges.</p>
                <p>Much of the documentation used in the volume has been made available for use in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of these
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Orders 12958 and 13142, under which all records over 25
                    years old, except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by
                    the President.</p>

                    <p>The intellectual assumptions on which the foreign policy of the <persName

                        established, in large measure, by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and his Assistant for National Security Affairs,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> assumed office in 1969 as an
                        established practitioner of foreign policy and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> was a recognized authority on the foreign policy
                        process. Both men came to their new responsibilities with well-developed
                        views on foreign policy. A selection of speeches and writings by <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> during the 2-year period prior to the assumption
                        of office in 1969 is presented at the beginning of the volume to provide a
                        background for the views developed during the initial 4 years of the
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>In July 1967 <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> outlined his views
                        on the role the United States should play in the world in a speech given to
                        the members of the exclusive Bohemian men's club in San Francisco. In his
                        memoirs, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> described the speech
                        as the one that gave him the most pleasure and satisfaction of his political
                        career. (See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>) <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> narrowed his focus in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Affairs</hi> article he published in October 1967 to “Asia After
                        Vietnam.” The article, which stresses a continuing role for the United
                        States as an Asian power, presages the diplomatic opening to China and
                        contains the germ of what would become the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine. (See <ref target="#d3">Document 3</ref>)
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s determination to limit
                        the role of the United States in combating Communist aggression in light of
                        the experience in Vietnam is more explicit in an excerpt from a campaign
                        speech he gave in May 1968. (See <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>) A
                        logical concomitant of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine was the perception that the burden of the fighting in South Vietnam
                        would have to shift from United States to South Vietnamese forces. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> pointed to the need to “Vietnamize”
                        the war in a campaign speech in October 1968. (See <ref target="#d7"
                            >Document 7</ref>) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>

                        Policy” which provides an overview of his perspective on foreign policy at
                        that point. (See <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>)</p>

                    <p>My fellow Bohemians and our guests: In my years of making speeches, I have
                        never appeared on an occasion where more of the audience was behind me!</p>
                    <p>After four months of travel to four continents, I can't tell you how good it
                        is to be back at Bohemia. It is dangerous to be dogmatic about any issue in
                        the world today. But of this one thing I am sure—it's much more pleasant to
                        get stoned in Bohemia than in Caracas.</p>
                    <p>It was Mr. <persName>Hoover</persName>'s custom on this occasion to put into
                        perspective some of the great issues of the day. In that tradition, I would
                        like to discuss American foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>I do not intend to dwell on current issues like Vietnam and the Mid-East
                        which are the subject of such constant attention in the daily press. Rather,
                        I suggest we do what we Americans seldom have the time and patience to do:
                        Let us take the long view. Let us evaluate the great forces at work in the
                        world and see what America's role should be if we are to realize our destiny
                        of preserving peace and freedom in the world in this last third of the
                        twentieth century.</p>
                    <p>One striking impression stands out after months of travel to major countries:
                        We live in a new world. Never in human history have more changes taken place
                        in the world in one generation.</p>
                    <p>It is a world of new leaders. True, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> are still with us;
                        but Churchill, Adenauer, Stalin, Khrushchev, Nehru, Sukarno—the other giants
                        of the post-war period have all left the world stage.</p>
                    <p>It is a world of new people. One-half of the people now living in the world
                        were born since World War II. This presents at once a problem and an
                        opportunity for peace. Because, as one Asian Prime Minister puts it, the new
                        generation has neither the old fears nor the old guilts of the old
                        generation.</p>
                    <p>It is a world of new ideas. Communism, Marxism, Socialism,
                        anti-colonialism—the great ideas which stirred men to revolution after <pb
                            n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0023"/>World War II have lost their pulling
                        power. As the Shah of Iran says—“the new generation is not imprisoned by any
                        ism.” The young people in all countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain
                        are groping for a new cause—a new religion. If any idea “turns them on” it
                        is a new sense of pragmatism—“what will work.”</p>
                    <p>Because we live in a new world, many of the old institutions are obsolete and
                        inadequate. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, foreign aid, USIA were set up to deal with the world of
                        twenty years ago. A quick trip around the world will show how different the
                        problems are today.</p>
                    <p>Twenty years ago Western Europe was weak economically and dependent on the
                        United States. It was united by a common fear of the threat of Communist
                        aggression. Today Western Europe is strong economically and economic
                        independence has inevitably led to more political independence. The winds of
                        détente have blown so strongly from East to West that except for Germany
                        most Europeans no longer fear the threat from the East. The consequences of
                        this change are enormous as far as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is
                        concerned. As <persName>Harold Macmillan</persName> puts it, “Alliances are
                        kept together by fear, not by love.” Even without <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, the European Alliance would be
                        in deep trouble.</p>
                    <p>Let us look at the Communist world. Twenty years ago the Soviet Union
                        dominated a monolithic Communist empire. Today, the Soviet Union and
                        Communist China are in a bitter struggle for leadership of the Communist
                        world. Eastern Europe turns West, though we must recognize that the
                        differences in Eastern Europe still cause less trouble to the Soviet Union
                        than the differences in Western Europe cause to the United States. The
                        Soviet economic system is turning away from the enforced equality of Marxism
                        to the incentives of capitalism.</p>
                    <p>Let us look at Latin America:</p>
                    <p>Twenty years ago Castro was a nobody. Cuba and all the other Latin republics
                        were considered to be solidly, permanently, and docilely on the side of the
                        United States. Today Castro has the strongest military force in the Western
                        Hemisphere next to the United States and he is exporting revolution all over
                        the continent. But even if Castro did not exist, Latin America would have to
                        be considered a major trouble spot. Despite the Alliance for Progress, Latin
                        America is barely holding its own in the race between production and
                        population. As it continues to fall further behind the rest of the world, it
                        becomes a tinder box for revolution.</p>
                    <p>Let us turn to Africa:</p>
                    <p>Just ten years ago Ethiopia and Liberia were the only independent countries
                        in Black Africa. Today there are thirty independent countries in Black
                        Africa. Fifteen of these countries have populations less than the State of
                        Maryland, and each has a vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Assembly equal to <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0024"/>that of the United
                        States. There were twelve coups in Black Africa in the last year. No one of
                        the thirty countries has a representative government by our standards and
                        the prospects that any will have such a government in a generation or even a
                        half-century are remote.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, non-Communist Asia, except for Vietnam, is the area which has
                        experienced the most hopeful change. Japan has recovered from the
                        devastation of World War II to the point that its one hundred million people
                        produce as much as Communist China's seven hundred million. Korea, Taiwan,
                        Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand are all dramatic economic success
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>There are grey areas:</p>
                    <p>As General Romulo might put it, the Philippines suffer from too much American
                        style democracy. Indonesia is recovering from too much Sukarno. India
                        suffers from too many people and a host of other problems too numerous to
                        enumerate. But over-all, it can be said without fear of contradiction that
                        the prospects for progress in non-Communist Asia are better than those in
                        Communist Asia.</p>
                    <p>Let us look at the balance of power in the world:</p>
                    <p>Twenty years ago the United States had a monopoly on the atomic bomb and our
                        military superiority was unquestioned. Even five years ago our advantage was
                        still decisive. Today the Soviet Union may be ahead of us in megaton
                        capacity and will have missile parity with the United States by 1970.
                        Communist China within five years will have a significant deliverable
                        nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let us look at American prestige:</p>
                    <p>Twenty years ago, after our great World War II victory, we were respected
                        throughout the world. Today, hardly a day goes by when our flag is not spit
                        upon, a library burned, an embassy stoned some place in the world. In fact,
                        you don't have to leave the United States to find examples.</p>
                    <p>This is a gloomy picture; but there is a much brighter side as well.</p>
                    <p>Communism is losing the ideological battle with freedom in Asia, Africa,
                        Latin America as well as in Europe. In Africa, the Communist appeal was
                        against colonialism. Now that the colonialists are gone, they must base
                        their case on being for Communism. But African tribalism and rebellious
                        individualism are simply incompatible with the rigid discipline a Communist
                        system imposes.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, the utter failure of Communism in Cuba has drastically
                        weakened the appeal of the Communist ideology in the rest of Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>In Asia, the remarkable success of private enterprise oriented economies in
                        Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, as contrasted <pb n="5"
                            xml:id="pg_5" facs="0025"/>to the failure of Communism in China and the
                        failure of socialism in Burma and Indonesia, makes it possible to state
                        unequivocally that the only way for the Communists to win in Vietnam, or
                        anywhere else in Asia, is by force and terror; they will never win by
                        persuasion.</p>
                    <p>All over the world, whether from East Germany to West, from Communist China
                        to free China, from Communist Cuba to the free American republics, the
                        traffic is all one way—from Communism to freedom.</p>
                    <p>Let us reappraise U.S. policy in the light of the new world in which we
                        live.</p>
                    <p>In Western Europe we must recognize that clearly apart from <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s actions the new economic
                        independence of European countries and the lack of fear of Soviet aggression
                        have contributed to a situation where it is not possible to keep the old
                        alliance together on its former basis.</p>
                    <p>Yet, whatever changes may have occurred as far as the Soviet threat is
                        concerned, one factor has not changed: A major reason for setting up the
                        alliance was to provide a military, political and economic home for the most
                        powerful people in Europe—the Germans. If the alliance is allowed to
                        continue to disintegrate, Germany, denied the right to develop nuclear
                        weapons, will be left defenseless in the heart of Europe and the Soviet
                        Union, holding the pawn of East Germany, will have a tempting diplomatic
                        target.</p>
                    <p>The highest priority American foreign policy objective must be to set up a
                        new alliance, multilateral, if possible, bilateral, if necessary, which will
                        keep Germany solidly on the Western side.</p>
                    <p>Let us look at the third world—Africa, Asia, Latin America. We reach one
                        inescapable conclusion—foreign aid needs a complete overhaul.</p>
                    <p>More money alone is not the answer. Latin America is a case in point. Nine
                        billion dollars has been spent on the Alliance for Progress in the last six
                        years with these results: The growth rate in Latin America was less than in
                        the previous five years. The growth rate in Latin America was less than that
                        of non-Communist Asia and of Communist Eastern Europe. Latin America will
                        become a permanent international depressed area unless revolutionary changes
                        are made in its economic, educational and governmental institutions.</p>
                    <p>Krieger of Argentina, probably the ablest of Latin America's economic
                        ministers, puts the case this way: “You Americans should be more blunt in
                        attaching conditions to your aid programs. Of course, the recipients aren't
                        going to like it. But the United States does us no favor when you aid an
                        unsound economic and social institution. All you do is to help perpetuate a
                        system that should be changed.”</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0026"/>
                    <p>In that spirit, let us use our aid programs to work toward such objectives as
                        the following:</p>
                    <p>The Latin American educational system is the most obsolete and inadequate in
                        the world in terms of preparing students for contributions to a modern
                        industrial state. It must be modernized and brought into the twentieth
                        century.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America, Africa, as well as in countries like India, there should be
                        more emphasis on agriculture, less on industrialization.</p>
                    <p>In every area of the world private, rather than government, enterprise should
                        be encouraged, not because we are trying to impose our ideas but because one
                        works and the other doesn't.</p>
                    <p>The United States should use its aid programs to reward our friends and
                        discourage our enemies. Before the recent Mid-East crisis, the fact that the
                        U.S. had continued its aid programs to countries like the U.A.R., Algeria
                        and Guinea when their leaders never missed a chance to condemn the United
                        States in world forums had the effect of discouraging our friends, confusing
                        the neutrals and bringing contempt from our enemies.</p>
                    <p>I would like to illustrate my last point with an example. Four of the most
                        dramatic economic success stories are Thailand, Iran, Taiwan and Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Thailand has a limited monarchy.</p>
                    <p>Iran has a strong monarchy.</p>
                    <p>Taiwan has a strong President with an oligarchy.</p>
                    <p>Mexico has one-party government.</p>
                    <p>Not one of these countries has a representative democracy by Western
                        standards. But it happens that in each case their system has worked for
                        them.</p>
                    <p>It is time for us to recognize that much as we like our own political system,
                        American style democracy is not necessarily the best form of government for
                        people in Asia, Africa and Latin America with entirely different
                        backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>Let us turn now to the most fundamental question—why continue foreign aid at
                        all? We must recognize that frustration over Vietnam, disillusionment with
                        our European allies who, despite our immense post-World War II aid to them,
                        more often than not refused to cooperate with us in our foreign policy
                        objectives, and the shocking mismanagement and waste in many of the aid
                        programs have all combined to create a new spirit of isolationism in the
                        United States which is becoming stronger in both political parties.</p>
                    <p>But, let us take a longer view. With the advance of transportation and
                        communications so vividly described by other Lakeside speakers, <pb n="7"
                            xml:id="pg_7" facs="0027"/>the world by the end of this century will be
                        a great city. As the world becomes smaller, the differences between rich and
                        poor will appear much larger. The three billion people living in the less
                        advanced areas of the world will not tolerate permanent second class
                        economic status. For example, at that time the people of the United States
                        will have a per capita income ten times as large as that of our closest
                        friends and neighbors in Latin America. The time to defuse this potentially
                        explosive situation is now.</p>
                    <p>Let us turn now to subject A, the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>This Spring a great debate raged in the chanceries of Europe and among
                        foreign policy experts in the United States as to how much Soviet policy had
                        changed under its new leaders. Some Soviet experts on both sides of the
                        Atlantic saw the new Soviet leaders turning 180 degrees from past policies
                        and seeking permanent peace with the United States and Europe as well as
                        using their influence to end the war in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The record of the Soviets in the Middle East war has caused a sober
                        reassessment of this point of view. At a time that they were talking peace
                        and détente in Europe, the Soviet leaders were spending 4 billion dollars
                        arming Nasser and his colleagues. They encouraged the Arab leaders in their
                        aggressive actions. They blocked diplomatic moves to avoid the war. They
                        supported a cease-fire only when it became necessary for them to do so to
                        save their Arab clients from further losses.</p>
                    <p>Then came the Glassboro conference. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> was a gentleman. He did not bang his shoe on the
                        table at the United Nations. Many hoped that the Soviet leaders had learned
                        their lesson and the spirit of Hollybush swept over the land. But it soon
                        became apparent that, while the music was different, the words were the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>More revealing have been the actions of the Soviet leaders since Glassboro.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> stopped to see Castro on
                        his way back to Moscow. The Soviet Union is sending millions of dollars in
                        arms to build the shattered Arab armies. The Soviet Union is still providing
                        100 per cent of the oil and 85 per cent of all sophisticated military
                        equipment for the armies of North Vietnam. The Soviet line against West
                        Germany has perceptively hardened. The Soviet Union continues to build both
                        offensive and defensive missiles.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that the Soviet leaders have not changed. But what we must
                        recognize is that the change is one of the head and not of the heart—of
                        necessity, not choice.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the facts which forced the change: Communist China is a
                        threat in the East; the Soviet Union needs friends in the West. The military
                        and economic strength of Western Europe thwarted their progressive designs
                        on that area. They faced increased demand for consumer <pb n="8"
                            xml:id="pg_8" facs="0028"/>goods from the Russian people. They looked
                        down the nuclear gunbarrel in the Cuban confrontation.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet leaders today have three major foreign policy objectives:</p>
                    <p>They are still Communists and they are committed to the goal of a Communist
                        world; they are battling the Chinese for leadership of that world. They want
                        to achieve that goal without war. At the same time they want more economic
                        progress at home. They will work with us only when doing so serves one or
                        more of these three objectives.</p>
                    <p>In the light of this analysis, the policy America should follow becomes
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Militarily, we must recognize that we have not had a world war for twenty
                        years because of America's clear military superiority. That superiority is
                        now threatened, both because of Soviet progress in missile development and
                        because of an attitude in U.S. policy circles that nuclear parity with the
                        Soviets is enough. Because the primary Soviet goal is still victory rather
                        than peace, we must never let the day come in a confrontation like Cuba and
                        the Mid-East where they, rather than we, have military superiority. The cost
                        of maintaining that superiority, including the development of an <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability, is a necessary investment in
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Economically, we should have a policy which encourages more trade with the
                        Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. We must recognize, however,
                        that to them trade is a political weapon. I believe in building bridges but
                        we should build only our end of the bridge. For example, there should be no
                        extension of long term credits or trade in strategic items with any nation,
                        including the Soviet Union, which aids the enemy in North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Diplomatically we should have discussions with the Soviet leaders at all
                        levels to reduce the possibility of miscalculation and to explore the areas
                        where bilateral agreements would reduce tensions. But we must always
                        remember in such negotiations that our goal is different from theirs: We
                        seek peace as an end in itself. They seek victory with peace being at this
                        time a means toward that end.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we can live in peace with the Soviet Union but until they give up
                        their goal for world conquest it will be for them a peace of necessity and
                        not of choice.</p>
                    <p>As we enter this last third of the twentieth century the hopes of the world
                        rest with America. Whether peace and freedom survive in the world depends on
                        American leadership.</p>
                    <p>Never has a nation had more advantages to lead. Our economic superiority is
                        enormous; our military superiority can be whatever we <pb n="9"
                            xml:id="pg_9" facs="0029"/>choose to make it. Most important, it happens
                        that we are on the right side—the side of freedom and peace and progress
                        against the forces of totalitarianism, reaction and war.</p>
                    <p>There is only one area where there is any question—that is whether America
                        has the national character and moral stamina to see us through this long and
                        difficult struggle.</p>
                    <p>In this context, the tragic events in Detroit take on a new meaning. This was
                        more than just another Negro riot. The looters were white as well as black.
                        We are reaping the whirlwind for a decade of growing disrespect for law,
                        decency and principle in America.</p>
                    <p>Without sanctimonious moralizing, let's look at some hard facts. Our judges
                        have gone too far in weakening the peace forces as against the criminal
                        forces in this country. Our opinion-makers have gone too far in promoting
                        the doctrine that when a law is broken—blame society, not the criminal. Our
                        teachers, preachers and politicians have gone too far in advocating the idea
                        that each individual should determine what laws are good and what laws are
                        bad and that he then should obey the law he likes and disobey the law he
                        dislikes.</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of these tragic events everyone will have a solution. Some
                        will say we need more laws. Others will say we need more law enforcement.
                        Others will say we need more money for cities, housing, education and
                        welfare. Each of these approaches deserves consideration and some should be
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>But in the final analysis there could be no progress without respect for law.
                        There will be no respect for law in a nation whose people lack character. We
                        need a national crusade to build American character in home, church and
                        school. Above all, we need examples of character from our great men.</p>
                    <p>We in Bohemia were privileged to know such a man.</p>
                    <p>I could describe <persName>Herbert Hoover</persName> as a great statesman. I
                        could describe him as a great businessman. I could describe him as a great
                        humanitarian. But, above all, he will be remembered as a man of great
                        character.</p>
                    <p>No leader in our history was more viciously vilified. Deserted by his
                        friends, maligned by his enemies, he triumphed over adversity. In the
                        twilight of his life he stood tall above his detractors. His triumph was a
                        triumph of character. We can be thankful that he was one of those rare men
                        who lived to hear the overwhelmingly favorable verdict of history on his
                        career.</p>
                    <p>Two thousand years ago when these great trees were saplings—the poet
                        Sophocles wrote, “One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the
                        day has been.”</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0030"/>
                    <p>Herbert Hoover's life was eloquent proof of those words.</p>
                    <p>And as we near the evening of another Bohemian Encampment, we, too, can look
                        back and say, “How splendid the day has been.”</p>

                    <p rend="center">ASIA AFTER VIET NAM</p>
                    <p>The war in Viet Nam has for so long dominated our field of vision that it has
                        distorted our picture of Asia. A small country on the rim of the continent
                        has filled the screen of our minds; but it does not fill the map. Sometimes
                        dramatically, but more often quietly, the rest of Asia has been undergoing a
                        profound, an exciting and on balance an extraordinarily promising
                        transformation. One key to this transformation is the emergence of Asian
                        regionalism; another is the development of a number of the Asian economies;
                        another is gathering disaffection with all the old isms that have so long
                        imprisoned so many minds and so many governments. By and large the
                        non-communist Asian governments are looking for solutions that work, rather
                        than solutions that fit a preconceived set of doctrines and dogmas.</p>
                    <p>Most of them also recognize a common danger, and see its source as Peking.
                        Taken together, these developments present an extraordinary set of
                        opportunities for a U.S. policy which must begin to look beyond Viet Nam. In
                        looking toward the future, however, we should not ignore the vital role Viet
                        Nam has played in making these developments possible. Whatever one may think
                        of the “domino” theory, it is beyond question that without the American
                        commitment in Viet Nam Asia would be a far different place today.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. presence has provided tangible and highly visible proof that
                        communism is not necessarily the wave of Asia's future. This was a vital
                        factor in the turnaround in Indonesia, where a tendency toward fatalism is a
                        national characteristic. It provided a shield behind which the
                        anti-communist forces found the courage and the capacity to stage their
                        counter-coup and, at the final moment, to rescue their country from the
                        Chinese orbit. And, with its 100 million people, and its 3,000-mile <pb
                            n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0031"/>arc of islands containing the
                        region's richest hoard of natural resources, Indonesia constitutes by far
                        the greatest prize in the Southeast Asian area.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this, Viet Nam has diverted Peking from such other potential targets
                        as India, Thailand and Malaysia. It has bought vitally needed time for
                        governments that were weak or unstable or leaning toward Peking as a hedge
                        against the future—time has imposed severe strains on the United States, not
                        only militarily and economically but socially and politically as well.
                        Bitter dissension has torn the fabric of American intellectual life, and
                        whatever the outcome of the war the tear may be a long time mending. If
                        another friendly country should be faced with an externally supported
                        communist insurrection—whether in Asia, or in Africa or even Latin
                        America—there is serious question whether the American public or the
                        American Congress would now support a unilateral American intervention, even
                        at the request of the host government. This makes it vitally in their own
                        interest that the nations in the path of China's ambitions move quickly to
                        establish an indigenous Asian framework for their own future security.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, they need to fashion arrangements able to deal both with
                        old-style wars and with new—with traditional wars, in which armies cross
                        over national boundaries, and with the so-called “wars of national
                        liberation,” in which they burrow under national boundaries.</p>
                    <p>I am not arguing that the day is past when the United States would respond
                        militarily to communist threats in the less stable parts of the world, or
                        that a unilateral response to a unilateral request for help is out of the
                        question. But other nations must recognize that the role of the United
                        States as world policeman is likely to be limited in the future. To ensure
                        that a U.S. response will be forthcoming if needed, machinery must be
                        created that is capable of meeting two conditions: (a) a collective effort
                        by the nations of the region to contain the threat by themselves; and, if
                        that effort fails, (b) a collective request to the United States for
                        assistance. This is important not only from the respective national
                        standpoints, but also from the standpoint of avoiding nuclear collision.</p>
                    <p>Nations not possessing great power can indulge in the luxury of criticism of
                        others; those possessing it have the responsibility of decision. Faced with
                        a clear challenge, the decision not to use one's power must be as deliberate
                        as the decision to use it. The consequences can be fully as far-reaching and
                        fully as irrevocable.</p>
                    <p>If another world war is to be prevented, every step possible must be taken to
                        avert direct confrontations between the nuclear powers. To achieve this, it
                        is essential to minimize the number of occasions on which the great powers
                        have to decide whether or not to commit their forces. These choices cannot
                        be eliminated, but they can be reduced by <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12"
                            facs="0032"/>the development of regional defense pacts, in which nations
                        undertake, among themselves, to attempt to contain aggression in their own
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>If the initial response to a threatened aggression, of whichever type—whether
                        across the border or under it—can be made by lesser powers in the immediate
                        area and thus within the path of aggression, one of two things can be
                        achieved: either they can in fact contain it by themselves, in which case
                        the United States is spared involvement and thus the world is spared the
                        consequences of great-power action; or, if they cannot, the ultimate choice
                        can be presented to the United States in clear-cut terms, by nations which
                        would automatically become allies in whatever response might prove
                        necessary. To put it another way, the regional pact becomes a buffer
                        separating the distant great power from the immediate threat. Only if the
                        buffer proves insufficient does the great power become involved, and then in
                        terms that make victory more attainable and the enterprise more
                        palatable.</p>
                    <p>This is particularly important when the threat takes the form of an
                        externally supported guerrilla action, as we have faced in Viet Nam, as is
                        even now being mounted in Thailand, and as could be launched in any of a
                        half-dozen other spots in the Chinese shadow. Viet Nam has shown how
                        difficult it is to make clear the distinction between this and an ordinary
                        factional civil war, and how subject the assisting power is to charges of
                        having intervened in an internal matter. Viet Nam's neighbors know that the
                        war there is not internal, but our own allies in Europe have difficulty
                        grasping the fact.</p>
                    <p>The fragmenting of the communist world has lent credence to the frequently
                        heard argument that a communist advance by proxy, as we have seen attempted
                        in Viet Nam, is of only peripheral importance; that with the weakening of
                        rigid central control of the communist world, local fights between communist
                        and non-communist factions are a local matter. This ignores, however, the
                        fact that with the decentralization of communist control has come an
                        appropriately tailored shift in communist tactics. National communism poses
                        a different kind of threat than did the old-style international communism,
                        but by being subtler it is in some ways more dangerous.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> was useful and appropriate to its
                        time, but it was Western in origin and drew its strength from the United
                        States and Europe. It has weakened to the point at which it is little more
                        than an institutional embodiment of an American commitment, and a somewhat
                        anachronistic relic of the days when France and Britain were active members.
                        Asia today needs its own security undertakings, reflecting the new realities
                        of Asian independence and Asian needs.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, despite a pattern of rapidly increasing cooperation in cultural and
                        economic affairs, the Asian nations have been unwilling <pb n="13"
                            xml:id="pg_13" facs="0033"/>to form a military grouping designed to
                        forestall the Chinese threat, even though several have bilateral
                        arrangements with the United States. But an appropriate foundation-stone
                        exists on which to build: the Asian and Pacific Council. <gloss
                            target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> held its first ministerial-level
                        meeting in Seoul in June 1966, and its second in Bangkok in July 1967. It
                        has carefully limited itself to strengthening regional cooperation in
                        economic, cultural and social matters, and its members have voiced strong
                        feelings that, as Japan's Foreign Minister Takeo Miki put it at the Bangkok
                        meeting, it should not be made “a body to promote anti-communist
                        campaigns.”</p>
                    <p>Despite <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>'s present cultural and
                        economic orientation, however, the solidifying awareness of China's threat
                        should make it possible—if the need for a regional alliance is put in
                        sufficiently compelling terms—to develop it into an alliance actively
                        dedicated to concerting whatever efforts might be necessary to maintain the
                        security of the region. And <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> is
                        peculiarly well situated to play such a role. Its members (South Korea,
                        Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, South Viet Nam, the Philippines,
                        Australia and New Zealand, with Laos as an observer) all are acutely
                        conscious of the Chinese threat. All except Malaysia have military ties with
                        the United States. It has the distinct advantage of including Australia and
                        New Zealand, which share the danger and would be able to contribute
                        substantially to its strength, without an unbalancing great-power
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to minimize the difficulties of winning acceptance of such a
                        concept. In Japan, public opinion still lags behind official awareness of
                        military needs. The avowedly neutralist nations under China's cloud would be
                        reluctant, at present, to join any such grouping. But looking further down
                        the road we can project either an erosion of their neutralism or the
                        formation of their own loose association or associations, which might be
                        tied into a militarily oriented <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> on
                        an interlocking or cooperative basis. One can hope that even India might
                        finally be persuaded to give its support, having itself been the target of
                        overt Chinese aggression, and still cherishing as it does a desire to play a
                        substantial role beyond its own borders.</p>

                    <p>Military security has to rest, ultimately, on economic and political
                        stability. One of the effects of the rapidity of change in the world today
                        is that there can no longer be static stability; there can only be dynamic
                        stability. A nation or society that fails to keep pace with change is in
                        danger of flying apart. It is important that we recognize this, but equally
                            <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0034"/>important that in trying to
                        maintain a dynamic stability we remember that the stability is as important
                        as the dynamism.</p>
                    <p>If a given set of ends is deemed desirable, then from the standpoint of those
                        dedicated to peace and an essential stability in world order the desideratum
                        is to reach those ends by evolutionary rather than revolutionary means.
                        Looking at the pattern of change in non-communist Asia, we find that the
                        professed aims of the revolutionaries are in fact being achieved by an
                        evolutionary process. This offers a dramatic opportunity to draw the
                        distinction between the fact of a revolutionary result and the process of
                        revolutionary change. The Asian nations are showing that evolutionary change
                        can be as exciting as revolutionary change. Having revolutionized the aims
                        of their societies, they are showing what can be achieved within a framework
                        of dynamic stability.</p>
                    <p>The “people,” in the broadest sense, have become an entity to be served
                        rather than used. In much of Asia, this change represents a revolution of no
                        less magnitude than the revolution that created the industrial West, or that
                        in the years following World War II transformed empires into new and
                        struggling nations. It is precisely the promise of this reversal that has
                        been at the heart of communist rhetoric, and at the heart of the popular and
                        intellectual appeal which that rhetoric achieved.</p>
                    <p>Not all the governments of non-communist Asia fit the Western ideal of
                        parliamentary democracy—far from it. But Americans must recognize that a
                        highly sophisticated, highly advanced political system, which required many
                        centuries to develop in the West, may not be best for other nations which
                        have far different traditions and are still in an earlier stage of
                        development. What matters is that these governments are consciously,
                        deliberately and programmatically developing in the direction of greater
                        liberty, greater abundance, broader choice and increased popular involvement
                        in the processes of government.</p>
                    <p>Poverty that was accepted for centuries as the norm is accepted no longer. In
                        a sense it could be said that a new chapter is being written in the winning
                        of the West: in this case, a winning of the promise of Western technology
                        and Western organization by the nations of the East. The cultural clash has
                        had its cost and produced its strains, but out of it is coming a
                        modernization of ancient civilizations that promises to leap the
                        centuries.</p>
                    <p>The process produces transitional anomalies—such as the Indian woman
                        squatting in the mud, forming cow-dung patties with her hands and laying
                        them out to dry, while a transistor radio in her lap plays music from a
                        Delhi station. It takes a long time to bring visions of the future to the
                        far villages—but time is needed to make those visions credible, and make
                        them achievable. Too wide a gap between reality and expectation always
                        produces an explosive situation, and the fact <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15"
                            facs="0035"/>that what the leaders know is possible is unknown to the
                        great mass of the peasantry helps buy time to make the possible achievable.
                        But the important thing is that the leaders do know what is possible, and by
                        and large they are determined to make it happen.</p>
                    <p>Whether that process is going to proceed at a pace fast enough to keep one
                        step ahead of the pressure of rising expectations is one of the great
                        questions and challenges of the years ahead. But there is solid ground for
                        hope. The successful Asian nations have been writing extraordinary records.
                        To call their performance an economic miracle would be something of a
                        semantic imprecision; it would also be a disservice. Precisely because the
                        origins and ingredients of that success are not miraculous, it offers hope
                        to those which have not yet turned the corner.</p>
                    <p>India still is a staggering giant, Burma flirts with economic chaos, and the
                        Philippines, caught in a conflict of cultures and in search of an identity,
                        lives in a precarious economic and social balance. But the most exciting
                        trends in economic development today are being recorded by those Asian
                        nations that have accepted the keys of progress and used them. Japan, Hong
                        Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia all have been
                        recording sustained economic growth rates of 7 percent a year or more; Japan
                        has sustained a remarkable average of 9 percent a year since 1950, and an
                        average 16.7 percent per year increase in exports over the same period.
                        Thailand shifted into a period of rapid growth in 1958 and has averaged 7
                        percent a year since. South Korea, despite the unflattering estimates of its
                        people's abilities by the average G.I. during the Korean War, is shooting
                        ahead at a growth rate that has averaged 8 percent a year since 1963, with
                        an average 42 percent a year increase in its exports.</p>
                    <p>These rapidly advancing countries vary widely in their social traditions and
                        political systems, but their methods of economic management have certain
                        traits in common: a prime reliance on private enterprise and on the pricing
                        mechanisms of the market as the chief determinant of business decisions; a
                        pacing of monetary expansion to match growth in output; receptivity to
                        private capital investment, both domestic and foreign, including such
                        incentives as tax advantages and quick government clearance of proposed
                        projects; imaginative national programs for dealing with social problems;
                        and, not least, a generally restrained posture in government planning, with
                        the government's role suggestive rather than coercive. These nations have,
                        in short, discovered and applied the lessons of America's own economic
                        success.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV</p>
                    <p>Any discussion of Asia's future must ultimately focus on the respective roles
                        of four giants: India, the world's most populous non-communist <pb n="16"
                            xml:id="pg_16" facs="0036"/>nation; Japan, Asia's principal industrial
                        and economic power; China, the world's most populous nation and Asia's most
                        immediate threat; and the United States, the greatest Pacific power.
                        (Although the U.S.S.R. occupies much of the land map of Asia, its principal
                        focus is toward the West and its vast Asian lands are an appendage of
                        European Russia.)</p>
                    <p>India is both challenging and frustrating: challenging because of its
                        promise, frustrating because of its performance. It suffers from escalating
                        overpopulation, from too much emphasis on industrialization and not enough
                        on agriculture, and from too doctrinaire a reliance on government enterprise
                        instead of private enterprise. Many are deeply pessimistic about its future.
                        One has to remember, however, that in the past five years India has fought
                        two wars and faced two catastrophic droughts. On both the population and the
                        agricultural fronts, India's present leaders at least are trying. And the
                        essential factor, from the standpoint of U.S. policy, is that a nation of
                        nearly half a billion people is seeking ways to wrench itself forward
                        without a sacrifice of basic freedoms; in exceedingly difficult
                        circumstances, the ideal of evolutionary change is being tested. For the
                        most populous representative democracy in the world to fail, while Communist
                        China—surmounting its troubles—succeeded, would be a disaster of worldwide
                        proportions. Thus the United States must do two things: (1) continue its aid
                        and support for Indian economic objectives; and (2) do its best to persuade
                        the Indian Government to shift its means and adjust its institutions so that
                        those objectives can be more quickly and more effectively secured, drawing
                        from the lessons not only of the United States but also of India's more
                        successful neighbors, including Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Japan has been edging cautiously and discreetly toward a wider leadership
                        role, acutely conscious at every step that bitter memories of the Greater
                        East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere might rise to haunt her if she pressed too
                        hard or too eagerly. But what would not have been possible ten, or even
                        five, years ago is becoming possible today. Half the people now living in
                        Asia have been born since World War II, and the new generation has neither
                        the old guilts (in the case of the Japanese themselves) nor the old fears
                        born of conquest.</p>
                    <p>The natural momentum of Japan's growth, the industry of her people and the
                        advanced state of her society must inevitably propel Japan into a more
                        conspicuous position of leadership. Japan's industrial complex, expanding by
                        14 percent annually since 1950, already is comparable to that of West
                        Germany or the United Kingdom. Japan's gross national product ($95 billion)
                        is substantially greater than that of mainland China, with seven times the
                        population. Japan is expected soon to rank as the world's third-strongest
                        economic power, trailing only the <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0037"
                        />United States and the Soviet Union. Along with this dramatic economic
                        surge, Japan will surely want to play a greater role both diplomatically and
                        militarily in maintaining the balance in Asia. As the Prime Minister of one
                        neighboring country put it: “The Japanese are a great people, and no great
                        people will accept as their destiny making better transistor radios and
                        teaching the underdeveloped how to grow better rice.”</p>
                    <p>This greater role will entail, among other things, a modification of the
                        present terms of the Japanese Constitution, which specifically provides that
                        “land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be
                        maintained.” (Japan's 275,000 men presently under arms are called
                        “Self-Defense Forces.”) Twenty years ago it was considered unthinkable that
                        Japan should acquire even a conventional military capability. Five years
                        ago, while some Japanese thought about it, they did not talk about it. Today
                        a substantial majority of Japanese still oppose the idea, but it is openly
                        discussed and debated. Looking toward the future, one must recognize that it
                        simply is not realistic to expect a nation moving into the first rank of
                        major powers to be totally dependent for its own security on another nation,
                        however close the ties. Japan's whole society has been restructured since
                        World War II. While there still are traces of fanaticism, its politics at
                        least conform to the democratic ideal. Not to trust Japan today with its own
                        armed forces and with responsibility for its own defense would be to place
                        its people and its government under a disability which, whatever its roots
                        in painful recent history, ill accords with the role Japan must play in
                        helping secure the common safety of non-communist Asia.</p>
                    <p>Any American policy toward Asia must come urgently to grips with the reality
                        of China. This does not mean, as many would simplistically have it, rushing
                        to grant recognition to Peking, to admit it to the United Nations and to ply
                        it with offers of trade—all of which would serve to confirm its rulers in
                        their present course. It does mean recognizing the present and potential
                        danger from Communist China, and taking measures designed to meet that
                        danger. It also means distinguishing carefully between long-range and
                        short-range policies, and fashioning short-range programs so as to advance
                        our long-range goals.</p>
                    <p>Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside
                        the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and
                        threaten its neighbors. There is no place on this small planet for a billion
                        of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation. But we could
                        go disastrously wrong if, in pursuing this long-range goal, we failed in the
                        short range to read the lessons of history.</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0038"/>
                    <p>The world cannot be safe until China changes. Thus our aim, to the extent
                        that we can influence events, should be to induce change. The way to do this
                        is to persuade China that it must change: that it cannot satisfy its
                        imperial ambitions, and that its own national interest requires a turning
                        away from foreign adventuring and a turning inward toward the solution of
                        its own domestic problems.</p>
                    <p>If the challenge posed by the Soviet Union after World War II was not
                        precisely similar, it was sufficiently so to offer a valid precedent and a
                        valuable lesson. Moscow finally changed when it, too, found that change was
                        necessary. This was essentially a change of the head, not of the heart.
                        Internal evolution played a role, to be sure, but the key factor was that
                        the West was able to create conditions—notably in the shoring up of European
                        defenses, the rapid restoration of European economies and the cementing of
                        the Atlantic Alliance—that forced Moscow to look to the wisdom of reaching
                        some measure of accommodation with the West. We are still far from reaching
                        a full détente, but at least substantial progress has been made.</p>
                    <p>During the next decade the West faces two prospects which, together, could
                        create a crisis of the first order: (1) that the Soviets may reach nuclear
                        parity with the United States; and (2) that China, within three to five
                        years, will have a significant deliverable nuclear capability—and that this
                        same China will be outside any nonproliferation treaty that might be signed,
                        free, if it chooses, to scatter its weapons among “liberation” forces
                        anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>This heightens the urgency of building buffers that can keep the major
                        nuclear powers apart in the case of “wars of national liberation,” supported
                        by Moscow or Peking but fought by proxy. It also requires that we now assign
                        to the strengthening of non-communist Asia a priority comparable to that
                        which we gave to the strengthening of Western Europe after World War II.</p>
                    <p>Some counsel conceding to China a “sphere of influence” embracing much of the
                        Asian mainland and extending even to the island nations beyond; others urge
                        that we eliminate the threat by preemptive war. Clearly, neither of these
                        courses would be acceptable to the United States or to its Asian allies.
                        Others argue that we should seek an anti-Chinese alliance with European
                        powers, even including the Soviet Union. Quite apart from the obvious
                        problems involved in Soviet participation, such a course would inevitably
                        carry connotations of Europe vs. Asia, white vs. non-white, which could have
                        catastrophic repercussions throughout the rest of the non-white world in
                        general and Asia in particular. If our long-range aim is to pull China back
                        in to the family of nations, we must avoid the impression that the great
                        powers or the European powers are “ganging up;” the response should clearly
                        be one <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0039"/>of active defense rather than
                        potential offense, and must be untainted with any suspicion of racism.</p>
                    <p>For the United States to go it alone in containing China would not only place
                        an unconscionable burden on our own country, but also would heighten the
                        chances of nuclear war while undercutting the independent development of the
                        nations of Asia. The primary restraint on China's Asian ambitions should be
                        exercised by the Asian nations in the path of those ambitions, backed by the
                        ultimate power of the United States. This is sound strategically, sound
                        psychologically and sound in terms of the dynamics of Asian development.
                        Only as the nations of non-communist Asia become so strong—economically,
                        politically and militarily—that they no longer furnish tempting targets for
                        Chinese aggression, will the leaders in Peking be persuaded to turn their
                        energies inward rather than outward. And that will be the time when the
                        dialogue with mainland China can begin.</p>
                    <p>For the short run, then, this means a policy of firm restraint, of no reward,
                        of a creative counterpressure designed to persuade Peking that its interests
                        can be served only by accepting the basic rules of international civility.
                        For the long run, it means pulling China back into the world community—but
                        as a great and progressing nation, not as the epicenter of world
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p>“Containment without isolation” is a good phrase and a sound concept, as far
                        as it goes. But it covers only half the problem. Along with it, we need a
                        positive policy of pressure and persuasion, of dynamic detoxification, a
                        marshaling of Asian forces both to keep the peace and to help draw off the
                        poison from the Thoughts of Mao.</p>
                    <p>Dealing with Red China is something like trying to cope with the more
                        explosive ghetto elements in our own country. In each case a potentially
                        destructive force has to be curbed; in each case an outlaw element has to be
                        brought within the law; in each case dialogues have to be opened; in each
                        case aggression has to be restrained while education proceeds; and, not
                        least, in neither case can we afford to let those now self-exiled from
                        society stay exiled forever. We have to proceed with both an urgency born of
                        necessity and a patience born of realism, moving step by calculated step
                        toward the final goal.</p>
                    <p rend="center">V</p>
                    <p>And finally, the role of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Weary with war, disheartened with allies, disillusioned with aid, dismayed at
                        domestic crises, many Americans are heeding the call of the new
                        isolationism. And they are not alone; there is a tendency in the whole
                        Western world to turn inward, to become parochial and
                        isolationist—dangerously so. But there can be neither peace nor security a
                            <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0040"/>generation hence unless we
                        recognize now the massiveness of the forces at work in Asia, where more than
                        half the world's people live and where the greatest explosive potential is
                        lodged.</p>
                    <p>Out of the wreckage of two world wars we forged a concept of an Atlantic
                        community, within which a ravaged Europe was rebuilt and the westward
                        advance of the Soviets contained. If tensions now strain that community,
                        these are themselves a byproduct of success. But history has its rhythms,
                        and now the focus of both crisis and change is shifting. Without turning our
                        backs on Europe, we have now to reach out westward to the East, and to
                        fashion the sinews of a Pacific community.</p>
                    <p>This has to be a community in the fullest sense: a community of purpose, of
                        understanding and of mutual assistance, in which military defenses are
                        coordinated while economies are strengthened; a community embracing a
                        concert of Asian strengths as a counterforce to the designs of China; one in
                        which Japan will play an increasing role, as befits its commanding position
                        as a world economic power; and one in which U.S. leadership is exercised
                        with restraint, with respect for our partners and with a sophisticated
                        discretion that ensures a genuinely Asian idiom and Asian origin for
                        whatever new Asian institutions are developed.</p>
                    <p>In a design for Asia's future, there is no room for heavy-handed American
                        pressures; there is need for subtle encouragement of the kind of Asian
                        initiatives that help bring the design to reality. The distinction may seem
                        superficial, but in fact it is central both to the kind of Asia we want and
                        to the effectiveness of the means of achieving it. The central pattern of
                        the future in U.S.-Asian relations must be American support for Asian
                        initiatives.</p>
                    <p>The industrial revolution has shown that mass abundance is possible, and as
                        the United States moves into the post-industrial world—the age of computers
                        and cybernetics—we have to find ways to engineer an escape from privation
                        for those now living in mass poverty. There can be no security, whatever our
                        nuclear stockpiles, in a world of boiling resentment and magnified envy. The
                        oceans provide no sanctuary for the rich, no barrier behind which we can
                        hide our abundance.</p>
                    <p>The struggle for influence in the Third World is a three-way race among
                        Moscow, Peking and the West. The West has offered both idealism and example,
                        but the idealism has often been unconvincing and the example non-idiomatic.
                        However, an industrialized Japan demonstrates the economically possible in
                        Asian terms, while an advancing Asia tied into a Pacific community offers a
                        bridge to the underdeveloped elsewhere. During this final third of the
                        twentieth century, the great race will be between man and change: the race
                        to control change, <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0041"/>rather than be
                        controlled by it. In this race we cannot afford to wait for others to act,
                        and then merely react. And the race in Asia is already under way.</p>

                    <p>The twentieth century has known little repose. Since the turn of the century,
                        international crises have been increasing in both frequency and severity.
                        The contemporary unrest, although less apocalyptic than the two world wars
                        which spawned it, is even more profoundly revolutionary in nature.</p>
                    <p>The essence of a revolution is that it appears to contemporaries as a series
                        of more or less unrelated upheavals. The temptation is great to treat each
                        issue as an immediate and isolated problem which once surmounted will permit
                        the fundamental stability of the international order to reassert itself. But
                        the crises which form the headlines of the day are symptoms of deep-seated
                        structural problems. The international system which produced stability for a
                        century collapsed under the impact of two world wars. The age of the
                        superpowers, which temporarily replaced it, is nearing its end. The current
                        international environment is in turmoil because its essential elements are
                        all in flux simultaneously. This essay will concentrate on structural and
                        conceptual problems rather than specific policy issues.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. The Structural Problem</p>
                    <p>For the first time, foreign policy has become global. In the past, the
                        various continents conducted their foreign policy essentially in isolation.
                        Throughout much of history, the foreign policy of Europe was scarcely
                        affected by events in Asia. When, in the late eighteenth and nineteenth <pb
                            n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0042"/>centuries, the European powers were
                        extending their influence throughout the world, the effective decisions
                        continued to be made in only a few great European capitals. Today, statesmen
                        face the unprecedented problem of formulating policy for well over a hundred
                        countries. Every nation, no matter how insignificant, participates in
                        international affairs. Ideas are transmitted almost instantaneously. What
                        used to be considered domestic events can now have world-wide
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>The revolutionary character of our age can be summed up in three general
                        statements: (a) the number of participants in the international order has
                        increased and their nature has altered; (b) their technical ability to
                        affect each other has vastly grown; (c) the scope of their purposes has
                        expanded.</p>
                    <p>Whenever the participants in the international system change, a period of
                        profound dislocation is inevitable. They can change because new states enter
                        the political system, or because there is a change in values as to what
                        constitutes legitimate rule, or, finally, because of the reduction in
                        influence of some traditional units. In our period, all of these factors
                        have combined. Since the end of the Second World War, several score of new
                        states have come into being. In the nineteenth century the emergence of even
                        a few new nations produced decades of adjustment, and after the First World
                        War, the successor states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were never
                        assimilated. Our age has yet to find a structure which matches the
                        responsibilities of the new nations to their aspirations.</p>
                    <p>As the number of participants has increased, technology has multiplied the
                        resources available for the conduct of foreign policy. A scientific
                        revolution has, for all practical purposes, removed technical limits from
                        the exercise of power in foreign policy. It has magnified insecurities
                        because it has made survival seem to depend on the accidents of a
                        technological breakthrough.</p>
                    <p>This trend has been compounded by the nature of contemporary domestic
                        structures. As long as the states' ability to mobilize resources was
                        limited, the severity of their conflicts had definite bounds. In the
                        eighteenth century, custom restricted the demands rulers by “divine right”
                        could make upon their subjects; a philosophy of minimum government performed
                        the same role through much of the nineteenth century. Our period has seen
                        the culmination of a process started by the French Revolution: the basing of
                        governmental legitimacy on popular support. Even totalitarian regimes are
                        aberrations of a democratic legitimacy; they depend on popular consensus
                        even when they manufacture it through propaganda and pressure. In such a
                        situation, the consensus is decisive; limitations of tradition are
                        essentially irrelevant. It is an ironic result of the democratization of
                        politics that it has enabled states to marshal ever more resources for their
                        competition.</p>
                    <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0043"/>
                    <p>Ideological conflict compounds these instabilities. In the great periods of
                        cabinet diplomacy, diplomats spoke the same language, not only in the sense
                        that French was the lingua franca, but more importantly because they tended
                        to understand intangibles in the same manner. A similar outlook about aims
                        and methods eases the tasks of diplomacy—it may even be a precondition for
                        it. In the absence of such a consensus, diplomats can still meet, but they
                        lose the ability to persuade. More time is spent on defining contending
                        positions than in resolving them. What seems most reasonable to one side
                        will appear most problematical to the other.</p>
                    <p>When there is ideological conflict, political loyalties no longer coincide
                        with political boundaries. Conflicts among states merge with divisions
                        within nations; the dividing line between domestic and foreign policy begins
                        to disappear. At least some states feel threatened not only by the foreign
                        policy of other countries but also, and perhaps especially, by domestic
                        transformations. A liberalized Communist regime in Prague—which had in no
                        way challenged Soviet preeminence in foreign policy—caused the Kremlin to
                        believe that its vital interests were threatened and to respond by occupying
                        the country without even the pretext of legality.</p>
                    <p>The tensions produced by ideological conflict are exacerbated by the
                        reduction in influence of the states that were considered great powers
                        before the First World War. The world has become militarily bipolar. Only
                        two powers—the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist
                        Republics—possess the full panoply of military might. Over the next decade,
                        no other country or group of countries will be capable of challenging their
                        physical preeminence. Indeed, the gap in military strength between the two
                        giant nuclear countries and the rest of the world is likely to increase
                        rather than diminish over that period.</p>
                    <p>Military bipolarity is a source of rigidity in foreign policy. The guardians
                        of the equilibrium of the nineteenth century were prepared to respond to
                        change with counteradjustment; the policy-makers of the superpowers in the
                        second half of the twentieth century have much less confidence in the
                        ability of the equilibrium to right itself after disturbance. Whatever
                        “balance” there is between the superpowers is regarded as both precarious
                        and inflexible. A bipolar world loses the perspective for nuance; a gain for
                        one side appears as an absolute loss for the other. Every issue seems to
                        involve a question of survival. The smaller countries are torn between a
                        desire for protection and a wish to escape big-power dominance. Each of the
                        superpowers is beset by the desire to maintain its preeminence among its
                        allies, to increase its influence among the uncommitted, and to enhance its
                        security vis-à-vis its opponent. The fact that some of these objectives may
                        well prove incompatible adds to the strain on the international system.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0044"/>
                    <p>But the age of the superpowers is now drawing to an end. Military bipolarity
                        has not only failed to prevent, it has actually encouraged political
                        multipolarity. Weaker allies have good reason to believe that their defense
                        is in the overwhelming interest of their senior partner. Hence, they see no
                        need to purchase its support by acquiescence in its policies. The new
                        nations feel protected by the rivalry of the superpowers, and their
                        nationalism leads to ever bolder assertions of self-will. Traditional uses
                        of power have become less feasible, and new forms of pressure have emerged
                        as a result of transitional loyalties and weak domestic structures.</p>
                    <p>This political multipolarity does not necessarily guarantee stability.
                        Rigidity is diminished, but so is manageability. Nationalism may succeed in
                        curbing the preeminence of the superpowers; it remains to be seen whether it
                        can supply an integrating concept more successfully in this century than in
                        the last. Few countries have the interest and only the superpowers have the
                        resources to become informed about global issues. As a result, diplomacy is
                        often geared to domestic politics and more concerned with striking a pose
                        than contributing to international order. Equilibrium is difficult to
                        achieve among states widely divergent in values, goals, expectations, and
                        previous experience.</p>
                    <p>The greatest need of the contemporary international system is an agreed
                        concept of order. In its absence, the awesome available power is
                        unrestrained by any consensus as to legitimacy; ideology and nationalism, in
                        their different ways, deepen international schisms. Many of the elements of
                        stability which characterized the international system in the nineteenth
                        century cannot be re-created in the modern age. The stable technology, the
                        multiplicity of major powers, the limited domestic claims, and the frontiers
                        which permitted adjustments are gone forever. A new concept of international
                        order is essential; without it stability will prove elusive.</p>
                    <p>This problem is particularly serious for the United States. Whatever our
                        intentions or policies, the fact that the United States disposes of the
                        greatest single aggregate of material power in the world is inescapable. A
                        new international order is inconceivable without a significant American
                        contribution. But the nature of this contribution has altered. For the two
                        decades after 1945, our international activities were based on the
                        assumption that technology plus managerial skills gave us the ability to
                        reshape the international system and to bring about domestic transformations
                        in “emerging countries.” This direct “operational” concept of international
                        order has proved too simple. Political multipolarity makes it impossible to
                        impose an American design. Our deepest challenge will be to evoke the
                        creativity of a pluralistic world, to base order <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25"
                            facs="0045"/>on political multipolarity even though overwhelming
                        military strength will remain with the two superpowers.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. The Limits of Bipolarity:</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Nature of Power in the Modern Period</p>
                    <p>Throughout history, military power was considered the final recourse.
                        Statesmen treated the acquisition of additional power as an obvious and
                        paramount objective. As recently as twenty-five years ago, it would have
                        been inconceivable that a country could possess too much strength for
                        effective political use; every increment of power was—at least
                        theoretically—politically effective. The minimum aim was to assure the
                        impermeability of the territory. Until the Second World War, a state's
                        strength could be measured by its ability to protect its population from
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>The nuclear age has destroyed this traditional measure. Increasing strength
                        no longer necessarily confers the ability to protect the population. No
                        foreseeable force level—not even full-scale ballistic missile defenses—can
                        prevent levels of damage eclipsing those of the two world wars. In these
                        conditions, the major problem is to discipline power so that it bears a
                        rational relationship to the objectives likely to be in dispute. The paradox
                        of contemporary military strength is that a gargantuan increase in power has
                        eroded its relationship to policy. The major nuclear powers are capable of
                        devastating each other. But they have great difficulty translating this
                        capability into policy except to prevent direct challenges to their own
                        survival—and this condition is interpreted with increasing strictness. The
                        capacity to destroy is difficult to translate into a plausible threat even
                        against countries with no capacity for retaliation. The margin of
                        superiority of the superpowers over the other states is widening; yet other
                        nations have an unprecedented scope for autonomous action. In relations with
                        many domestically weak countries, a radio transmitter can be a more
                        effective form of pressure than a squadron of B-52s. In other words, power
                        no longer translates automatically into influence. This does not mean that
                        impotence increases influence, only that power does not automatically confer
                        it.</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs has profound consequences for traditional notions of
                        balance of power. In the past, stability has always presupposed the
                        existence of an equilibrium of power which prevented one state from imposing
                        its will on the others.</p>
                    <p>The traditional criteria for the balance of power were territorial. A state
                        could gain overwhelming superiority only by conquest; hence, as long as
                        territorial expansion was foreclosed, or severely limited, the equilibrium
                        was likely to be preserved. In the contemporary period, this is no longer
                        true. Some conquests add little to effective military <pb n="26"
                            xml:id="pg_26" facs="0046"/>strength; major increases in power are
                        possible entirely through developments within the territory of a sovereign
                        state. China gained more in real military power through the acquisition of
                        nuclear weapons than if it had conquered all of Southeast Asia. If the
                        Soviet Union had occupied Western Europe but had remained without nuclear
                        weapons, it would be less powerful than it is now with its existing nuclear
                        arsenal within its present borders. In other words, the really fundamental
                        changes in the balance of power have all occurred within the territorial
                        limits of sovereign states. Clearly, there is an urgent need to analyze just
                        what is understood by power—as well as by balance of power—in the nuclear
                        age.</p>
                    <p>This would be difficult enough were technology stable. It becomes enormously
                        complicated when a scientific revolution produces an upheaval in weapons
                        technology at five-year intervals. Slogans like “superiority,” “parity,”
                        “assured destruction,” compete unencumbered by clear definitions of their
                        operational military significance, much less a consensus on their political
                        implications. The gap between experts and decision-makers is widening.</p>
                    <p>In short, as power has grown more awesome, it has also turned abstract,
                        intangible, elusive. Deterrence has become the dominant military policy. But
                        deterrence depends above all on psychological criteria. It seeks to keep an
                        opponent from a given course by posing unacceptable risks. For purposes of
                        deterrence, the opponent's calculations are decisive. A bluff taken
                        seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a bluff. For
                        political purposes, the meaningful measurement of military strength is the
                        assessment of it by the other side. Psychological criteria vie in importance
                        with strategic doctrine.</p>
                    <p>The abstract nature of modern power affects domestic disputes profoundly.
                        Deterrence is tested negatively by things which do not happen. But it is
                        never possible to demonstrate <hi rend="italic">why</hi> something has not
                        occurred. Is it because we are pursuing the best possible policy or only a
                        marginally effective one? Bitter debate even among those who believe in the
                        necessity of defense policy is inevitable and bound to be inconclusive.
                        Moreover, the longer peace is maintained—or the more successful deterrence
                        is—the more it furnishes arguments for those who are opposed to the very
                        premises of defense policy. Perhaps there was no need for preparedness in
                        the first place because the opponent never meant to attack. In the modern
                        state, national security is likely to be a highly divisive domestic
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>The enormity of modern power has destroyed its cumulative impact to a
                        considerable extent. Throughout history the use of force set a precedent; it
                        demonstrated a capacity to use power for national ends. In the twentieth
                        century any use of force sets up inhibitions against <pb n="27"
                            xml:id="pg_27" facs="0047"/>resorting to it again. Whatever the outcome
                        of the war in Vietnam, it is clear that it has greatly diminished American
                        willingness to become involved in this form of warfare elsewhere. Its
                        utility as a precedent has therefore been importantly undermined.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty of forming a conception of power is paralleled by the problem
                        of how to use it diplomatically. In the past, measures to increase readiness
                        signaled the mounting seriousness with which an issue was viewed.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d4fn2">Sometimes these measures got out of control; the
                            mobilization schedules were one of the principal reasons for the
                            outbreak of the First World War. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        But such measures have become less obvious and more dangerous when weapons
                        are always at a high state of readiness—solid-fuel missiles require less
                        than ten minutes to be fired—and are hidden either under the ground or under
                        the oceans. With respect to nuclear weapons, signaling increased readiness
                        has to take place in a narrow range between the danger of failure and the
                        risk of a preemptive strike.</p>
                    <p>Even when only conventional weapons are involved, the question of what
                        constitutes a politically meaningful threat is increasingly complicated.
                        After the capture of the Pueblo, the United States called up thirteen
                        thousand reservists and moved an aircraft carrier into the waters off the
                        shores of Korea. Did the fact that we had to call up reserves when
                        challenged by a fifth-rate military power convey that we meant to act or
                        that we were overextended? Did the move of the aircraft carrier indicate a
                        decision to retaliate or was it intended primarily to strike a pose?</p>
                    <p>The problem is illustrated dramatically by the war in Vietnam. A massive
                        breakdown of communication occurred not only within the policy-making
                        machinery in the United States but also between the United States and Hanoi.
                        Over the past five years, the U.S. government has found it difficult, if not
                        impossible, to define what it understood by victory. President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> extended an open-ended offer for
                        unconditional negotiations. Yet our troops were deployed as if this offer
                        had not been made. The deployment was based on purely military
                        considerations; it did not take into account the possibility that our troops
                        might have to support a negotiation—the timing of which we had, in effect,
                        left to the opponent. Strategy divorced from foreign policy proved
                        sterile.</p>
                    <p>These perplexities have spurred new interest in arms-control negotiations,
                        especially those dealing with strategic missiles. These negotiations can be
                        important for the peace and security of the world. But to be effective, they
                        require an intellectual resolution of the issues which have bedeviled the
                        formulation of military policy. Unless we are able to give an operational
                        meaning to terms such as “superiority” or “stability,” negotiations will
                        lack criteria by which to judge progress.</p>

                    <p>Thus, whatever the course—a continuation of the arms race or arms control—a
                        new look at American national security policy is essential. Over ten years
                        have passed since the last comprehensive, bipartisan, high-level
                        reevaluation of all aspects of national security: the Gaither Committee. A
                        new administration should move quickly to bring about such a review. It
                        should deal with some of the following problems: (a) a definition of the
                        national interest and national security over the next decade; (b) the nature
                        of military power in that period; (c) the relationship of military power to
                        political influence; (d) implications and feasibility (both military and
                        political) of various postures—superiority, parity, and so on; (e) the
                        implications (both political and military) of new developments such as
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> (multiple individually targeted
                        reentry vehicles) and ballistic missile defenses; (f) the prospects for arms

                        policy. For a decade and a half after the Second World War, the United
                        States identified security with alliances. A global network of relationships
                        grew up based on the proposition that deterrence of aggression required the
                        largest possible grouping of powers.</p>
                    <p>This system of alliances was always in difficulty outside the Atlantic area
                        because it tried to apply principles drawn from the multipolar world of the
                        eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when several major powers of roughly
                        equal strength existed. Then, indeed, it was impossible for one country to
                        achieve dominance if several others combined to prevent it. But this was not
                        the case in the era of the superpowers of the forties and fifties. Outside
                        Europe, our allies added to our strength only marginally; they were in no
                        position to reinforce each other's capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Alliances, to be effective, must meet four conditions: (1) a common
                        objective—usually defense against a common danger; (2) a degree of joint
                        policy at least sufficient to define the casus belli; (3) some technical
                        means of cooperation in case common action is decided upon; (4) a penalty
                        for noncooperation—that is, the possibility of being refused assistance must
                        exist—otherwise protection will be taken for granted and the mutuality of
                        obligation will break down.</p>
                    <p>In the system of alliances developed by the United States after the Second
                        World War, these conditions have never been met outside the North Atlantic
                        Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>). In the
                        Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>)
                        and the Central Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                        >CENTO</gloss>), to which we belong in all but name, there has been no
                        consensus <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0049"/>as to the danger.
                        Pakistan's motive for obtaining U.S. arms was not security against a
                        Communist attack but protection against India. The Arab members of <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> armed not against the U.S.S.R. but
                        against Israel. Lacking a conception of common interests, the members of
                        these alliances have never been able to develop common policies with respect
                        to issues of war and peace. Had they been able to do so, such policies might
                        well have been stillborn anyway, because the technical means of cooperation
                        have been lacking. Most allies have neither the resources nor the will to
                        render mutual support. A state which finds it difficult to maintain order or
                        coherence of policy at home does not increase its strength by combining with
                        states suffering similar disabilities.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> have grown moribund as instruments of
                        collective action. Because the United States has often seemed more eager to
                        engage in the defense of its <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> allies than they themselves,
                        they have become convinced that non-cooperation will have no cost. In fact,
                        they have been able to give the impression that it would be worse for us
                        than for them if they fell to Communism. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> have become,
                        in effect, unilateral American guarantees. At best, they provide a legal
                        basis for bilateral U.S. aid.</p>
                    <p>The case is different with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Here we are
                        united with countries of similar traditions and domestic structures. At the
                        start, there was a common conception of the threat. The technical means for
                        cooperation existed. Mechanisms for developing common policies came into
                        being—especially in the military field. Thus in its first decade and a
                            half,<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was a dynamic and creative
                        institution.</p>
                    <p>Today, however, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is in disarray as well.
                        Actions by the United States—above all, frequent unilateral changes of
                        policy—are partially responsible. But the most important cause is the
                        transformation of the international environment, specifically the decline in
                        the preeminence of the superpowers and the emergence of political
                        multipolarity. Where the alliances outside of Europe have never been vital
                        because they failed to take into account the military bipolarity of the
                        fifties, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is in difficulties because it
                        has yet to adjust to the political multipolarity of the late sixties.</p>
                    <p>When <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was founded in 1949, Europeans had
                        a dual fear: the danger of an imminent Soviet attack and the prospect of
                        eventual U.S. withdrawal. In the late 1960s, however, the fear of Soviet
                        invasion has declined. Even the attack on Czechoslovakia is likely to
                        restore anxiety about Soviet military aggression only temporarily. At the
                        same time, two decades of American military presence in Europe coupled with
                        American predominance in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning have
                        sharply reduced the fear that America might wash its hands of European
                        concerns.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0050"/>
                    <p>When <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was formed, moreover, the
                        principal threat to world peace seemed to lie in a Soviet attack on Europe.
                        In recent years, the view has grown that equally grave risks are likely to
                        arise in trouble spots outside Europe. To most Europeans, these do not
                        appear as immediate threats to their independence or security. The irony
                        here is striking. In the fifties, Europeans were asking for American
                        assistance in Asia and the Middle East with the argument that they were
                        defending the greater interests of freedom. The United States replied that
                        these very interests required American aloofness. Today, the roles are
                        precisely reversed. It is Europe that evades our entreaties to play a global
                        role; that is to say, Europeans do not consider their interests at stake in
                        America's extra-European involvement.</p>
                    <p>These are symptoms of deeper, structural problems, however. One problem,
                        paradoxically, is the growth of European economic strength and political
                        self-confidence. At the end of the Second World War, Europe was dependent on
                        the United States for economic assistance, political stability, and military
                        protection. As long as Europe needed the shelter of a superpower, American
                        predominance was inevitable. In relations with the United States, European
                        statesmen acted as lobbyists rather than as diplomats. Their influence
                        depended less on the weight of their countries than on the impact of their
                        personalities. A form of consultation evolved whereby Europeans sought to
                        influence American actions by giving us a reputation to uphold or—to put it
                        more crudely—by oscillating between flattery and almost plaintive appeals
                        for reassurance. The United States, secure in its predominance, in turn
                        concentrated on soothing occasional European outbreaks of insecurity rather
                        than on analyzing their causes.</p>
                    <p>Tutelage is a comfortable relationship for the senior partner, but it is
                        demoralizing in the long run. It breeds illusions of omniscience on one side
                        and attitudes of impotent irresponsibility on the other. In any event, the
                        United States could not expect to perpetuate the accident of Europe's
                        postwar exhaustion into a permanent pattern of international relations.
                        Europe's economic recovery inevitably led to a return to more traditional
                        political pressures.</p>
                    <p>These changes in Europe were bound to lead to a difficult transitional
                        period. They could have resulted in a new partnership between the United
                        States and an economically resurgent and politically united Europe, as had
                        been envisaged by many of the early advocates of Atlantic unity. However,
                        the European situation has not resolved itself in that way. Thoughtful
                        Europeans know that Europe must unite in some form if it is to play a major
                        role in the long run. They are aware, too, that Europe does not make even
                        approximately the defense effort of which it is capable. But European unity
                        is stymied, and domestic politics <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0051"/>has
                        almost everywhere dominated security policy. The result is a massive
                        frustration which expresses itself in special testiness toward the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>These strains have been complicated by the growth of Soviet nuclear power.
                        The changed nature of power in the modern period has affected <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> profoundly. As the risks of nuclear war
                        have become enormous, the credibility of traditional pledges of support has
                        inevitably been reduced. In the past, a country would carry out a commitment
                        because, it could plausibly be argued, the consequences of not doing so were
                        worse than those of coming to the ally's assistance. This is no longer
                        self-evident. In each of the last three annual statements by the Secretary
                        of Defense on the U.S. defense posture, the estimate of dead in a general
                        nuclear war ranged from 40 to 120 million. This figure will, if anything,
                        increase. It will become more and more difficult to demonstrate that
                        anything is worse than the elimination of over half of a society in a matter
                        of days. The more <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> relies on strategic
                        nuclear war as a counter to all forms of attack, the less credible its
                        pledges will be.</p>
                    <p>The consciousness of nuclear threat by the two superpowers has undermined
                        allied relationships in yet another way. For understandable reasons, the
                        superpowers have sought to make the nuclear environment more
                        predictable—witness the nuclear test ban treaty and the nonproliferation
                        treaty. But the blind spot in our policy has been the failure to understand
                        that, in the absence of full consultation, our allies see in these talks the
                        possible forerunner of a more comprehensive arrangement affecting their
                        vital interests negotiated without them. Strategic arms talks thus emphasize
                        the need of political understanding in acute form. The pattern of
                        negotiating an agreement first and then giving our allies an
                        opportunity—even a full one—to comment is intolerable in the long run. It
                        puts the onus of failure on them, and it prevents them from doing more than
                        quibble about a framework with which they may disagree. Strains have been
                        reinforced by the uncertain American response to the Soviet invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia—especially the reluctance to give up the prospect of a summit
                        meeting. Atlantic relations, for all their seemingly normalcy, thus face a
                        profound crisis.</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs has been especially difficult for those Americans who
                        deserve most credit for forging existing Atlantic relations. Two decades of
                        hegemony have produced the illusion that present Atlantic arrangements are
                        “natural,” that wise policy consists of making the existing framework more
                        tolerable. “Leadership” and “partnership” are invoked, but the content given
                        to these words is usually that which will support the existing pattern.
                        European unity is advocated to enable Europeans to share burdens on a
                        world-wide scale.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0052"/>
                    <p>Such a view fails to take into account the realities of political
                        multipolarity. The aim of returning to the “great days of the Marshall Plan”
                        is impossible. Nothing would sunder Atlantic relationships so surely as the
                        attempt to reassert the notions of leadership appropriate to the early days
                        of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In the bipolar world of the
                        forties and fifties, order could be equated with military security;
                        integrated command arrangements sufficed as the principal bond of unity. In
                        the sixties, security, while still important, has not been enough. Every
                        crisis from Berlin to Czechoslovakia has seen the call for “strengthening
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>” confined to military
                        dispositions. Within months a malaise has become obvious again because the
                        overriding need for a common political conception has not been recognized.
                        The challenge of the seventies will be to forge unity with political
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>It is not “natural” that the major decisions about the defense of an area so
                        potentially powerful as Western Europe should be made three thousand miles
                        away. It is not “normal” that Atlantic policies should be geared to American
                        conceptions. In the forties and fifties, practicing unity—through formal
                        resolutions and periodic reassurances—was profoundly important as a symbol
                        of the end of our isolationism. In the decade ahead, we cannot aim at unity
                        as an end in itself; it must emerge from common conceptions and new
                        structures.</p>
                    <p>“Burden-sharing” will not supply that impetus. Countries do not assume
                        burdens because it is fair, only because it is necessary. While there are
                        strong arguments for Atlantic partnership and European unity, enabling
                        Europe to play a global role is not one of them. A nation assumes
                        responsibilities not only because it has resources but because it has a
                        certain view of its own destiny. Through the greater part of its
                        history—until the Second World War—the United States possessed the resources
                        but not the philosophy for a global role. Today, the poorest Western
                        European country—Portugal—has the widest commitments outside Europe because
                        its historic image of itself has become bound up with its overseas
                        possessions. This condition is unlikely to be met by any other European
                        country—with the possible exception of Great Britain—no matter what its
                        increase in power. Partially as the result of decolonization, Europeans are
                        unlikely to conduct a significant global policy whatever their resources or
                        their degree of unity. Cooperation between the United States and Europe must
                        concentrate on issues within the Atlantic area rather than global
                        partnership.</p>
                    <p>Even within the Atlantic area, a more equitable distribution of
                        responsibilities has two prerequisites: there must be some consensus in the
                        analysis of the international situation, at least as it affects Europe;
                        there must be a conviction that the United States cannot or will not carry
                        all the burdens alone. Neither condition is met today. The traditional <pb
                            n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0053"/>notion of American leadership tends
                        to stifle European incentives for autonomy. Improved consultation—the remedy
                        usually proposed—can only alleviate, not remove, the difficulty.</p>
                    <p>The problem of consultation is complex, of course. No doubt unilateral
                        American action has compounded the uneasiness produced by American
                        predominance and European weakness. The shift in emphasis of American
                        policy, from the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> multilateral force to
                        the nonproliferation treaty, and frequent unilateral changes in strategic
                        doctrine, have all tended to produce disquiet and to undermine the domestic
                        position of ministers who had staked their futures on supporting the
                        American viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>It is far from self-evident, however, that more extensive consultation within
                        the existing framework can be more than a palliative. One problem concerns
                        technical competence. In any large bureaucracy—and an international
                        consultative process has many similarities to domestic administrative
                        procedures—the weight given to advice bears some relation to the competence
                        it reflects. If one partner possesses all the technical competence, the
                        process of consultation is likely to remain barren. The minimum requirement
                        for effective consultation is that each ally have enough knowledge to give
                        meaningful advice.</p>
                    <p>But there are even more important limits to the process of consultation. The
                        losing party in a domestic dispute has three choices: (a) it can accept the
                        setback with the expectation of winning another battle later on—this is the
                        usual bureaucratic attitude and it is based on the assurance of another
                        hearing; (b) if advice is consistently ignored, it can resign and go into
                        opposition; (c) as the opposition party, it can have the purpose either of
                        inducing the existing government to change its course or of replacing it. If
                        all these avenues are closed, violence or mounting frustration are the
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>Only the first option is open to sovereign states bound together by an
                        alliance, since they obviously cannot resign or go into opposition without
                        wrecking the alliance. They cannot affect the process by which their
                        partners' decision-makers are chosen despite the fact that this may be
                        crucial for their fate. Indeed, as long as the need to maintain the alliance
                        overrides all other concerns, disagreement is likely to be stifled. Advice
                        without responsibility and disagreement without an outlet can turn
                        consultation into a frustrating exercise which compounds rather than
                        alleviates discord.</p>
                    <p>Consultation is especially difficult when it lacks an integrating over-all
                        framework. The consultation about the nonproliferation treaty concerned
                        specific provisions but not the underlying general philosophy which was of
                        the deepest concern to many of our allies, especially Italy and the Federal
                        Republic of Germany. During periods of détente, <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                            facs="0054"/>each ally makes its own approach to Eastern Europe or the
                        U.S.S.R. without attempting to further a coherent Western enterprise. During
                        periods of crisis, there is pressure for American reassurance but not for a
                        clearly defined common philosophy. In these circumstances, consultation runs
                        the risk of being irrelevant. The issues it “solves” are peripheral; the
                        central issues are inadequately articulated. It deals haphazardly in answers
                        to undefined questions.</p>
                    <p>Such a relationship is not healthy in the long run. Even with the best will,
                        the present structure encourages American unilateralism and European
                        irresponsibility. This is a serious problem for the United States. If the
                        United States remains the trustee of every non-Communist area, it will
                        exhaust its psychological resources. No country can act wisely
                        simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time. A more
                        pluralistic world—especially in relationships with friends—is profoundly in
                        our long-term interest. Political multipolarity, while difficult to get used
                        to, is the precondition for a new period of creativity. Painful as it may be
                        to admit, we could benefit from a counterweight that would discipline our
                        occasional impetuosity and, by supplying historical perspective, modify our
                        penchant for abstract and “final” solutions.</p>
                    <p>All of this suggests that there is no alternative to European unity either
                        for the United States or for Europe. In its absence, the malaise can only be
                        alleviated, not ended. Ultimately, this is a problem primarily for the
                        Europeans. In the recent past, the United States has often defeated its
                        purposes by committing itself to one particular form of European unity—that
                        of federalism. It has also complicated British membership in the Common
                        Market by making it a direct objective of American policy.</p>
                    <p>In the next decade the architectonic approach to Atlantic policy will no
                        longer be possible. The American contribution must be more philosophical; it
                        will have to consist more of understanding and quiet, behind-the-scenes
                        encouragement than of the propagation of formal institutional structures.
                        Involved here is the American conception of how nations cooperate. A
                        tradition of legalism and habits of predominance have produced a tendency to
                        multiply formal arrangements.</p>
                    <p>But growing European autonomy forces us to learn that nations cooperate less
                        because they have a legal obligation to do so than because they have common
                        purposes. Command arrangements cannot substitute for common interests.
                        Coordinated strategy will be empty unless it reflects shared political
                        concepts. The chance of disagreements on peripheral issues may be the price
                        for unity on issues that really matter. The memory of European impotence and
                        American tutelage should not delude us into believing that we understand
                        Europe's problems better <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0055"/>than it does
                        itself. Third-force dangers are not avoided by legal formulas, and, more
                        important, they have been overdrawn. It is hard to visualize a “deal”
                        between the Soviet Union and Europe which would jeopardize our interests
                        without jeopardizing European interests first. In any event, a sense of
                        responsibility in Europe will be a much better counter to Soviet efforts to
                        undermine unity than American tutelage.</p>
                    <p>In short, our relations with Europeans are better founded on developing a
                        community of interests than on the elaboration of formal legal obligations.
                        No precise blueprint for such an arrangement is possible because different
                        fields of activity have different needs. In the military sphere, for
                        example, modern technology will impose a greater degree of integration than
                        is necessary in other areas. Whatever their formal autonomy, it is almost
                        inconceivable that our allies would prefer to go to war without the support
                        of the United States, given the relatively small nuclear forces in prospect
                        for them. Close coordination between Europe and the United States in the
                        military sphere is dictated by self-interest, and Europe has more to gain
                        from it than the United States.</p>
                    <p>For this very reason, it is in our interest that Europeans should assume much
                        greater responsibility for developing doctrine and force levels in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, perhaps by vitalizing such institutions
                        as the West European Union (<gloss target="#t_WEU1">WEU</gloss>), perhaps by
                        alternative arrangements. The Supreme Allied Commander should in time be a
                        European.</p>
                    <p>Military arrangements are not enough, however. Under current conditions, no
                        statesman will risk a cataclysm simply to fulfill a legal obligation. He
                        will do so only if a degree of political cooperation has been established
                        which links the fate of each partner with the survival of all the others.
                        This requires an entirely new order of political creativity.</p>
                    <p>Coordination is especially necessary in East-West relations. The conventional
                        view is that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> can be as useful an
                        instrument for détente as for defense. This is doubtful—at least in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s present form. A military alliance, one
                        of the chief cohesive links of which is its integrated command arrangement,
                        is not the best instrument for flexible diplomacy. Turning <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> into an instrument of détente might
                        reduce its security contribution without achieving a relaxation of tensions.
                        A diplomatic confrontation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                        Warsaw Pact would have all the rigidities of the bipolar military world. It
                        would raise fears in Western Europe of an American-Soviet condominium, and
                        it would tend to legitimize the Soviet hegemonical position in Eastern
                        Europe. Above all, it would fail to take advantage of the flexibility
                        afforded by greater Western European unity and autonomy. As Europe gains
                        structure, its attraction for Eastern Europe is bound to increase. The major
                        initiatives to improve relations between Western and Eastern Europe should
                        originate in Europe with the United States in a reserve position.</p>
                    <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0056"/>
                    <p>Such an approach can work only if there is a real consensus as to objectives.
                        Philosophical agreement can make possible flexibility of method. This will
                        require a form of consultation much more substantial than that which now
                        exists and a far more effective and coherent European contribution.</p>
                    <p>To be sure, events in Czechoslovakia demonstrate the limits of Eastern
                        European autonomy that the Soviet Union is now prepared to tolerate. But the
                        Soviet Union may not be willing indefinitely to use the Red Army primarily
                        against allies as it has done three times in a decade and a half. In any
                        event, no Western policy can guarantee a more favorable evolution in Central
                        Europe; all it can do is to take advantage of an opportunity if it
                        arises.</p>
                    <p>Policy outside Europe is likely to be divergent. Given the changed European
                        perspective, an effort to bring about global burden-sharing might only
                        produce stagnation. The allies would be able to agree primarily on doing
                        nothing. Any crisis occurring anywhere would turn automatically and
                        organically world-wide. American acceptance of European autonomy implies
                        also European acceptance of a degree of American autonomy with respect to
                        areas in which, for understandable reasons, European concern has
                        lessened.</p>
                    <p>There may be opportunities for cooperation in hitherto purely national
                        efforts—for example, our space program. European participation in it could
                        help to remedy the “technological gap.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, under present circumstances, an especially meaningful community of
                        interests can be developed in the social sphere. All modern states face
                        problems of bureaucratization, pollution, environmental control, urban
                        growth. These problems know no national considerations. If the nations of
                        the Atlantic work together on these issues—through either private or
                        governmental channels or both—a new generation habituated to cooperative
                        efforts could develop similar to that spawned in different circumstances by
                        the Marshall Plan.</p>
                    <p>It is high time that the nations bordering the Atlantic deal—formally,
                        systematically, and at the highest level—with questions such as these: (a)
                        What are the relative roles of Europe and the United States in East-West
                        contacts? (b) Is a division of functions conceivable in which Western Europe
                        plays the principal role in relation to Eastern Europe while the United
                        States concentrates on relationships with the U.S.S.R.? (c) What forms of
                        political consultation does this require? (d) In what areas of the world is
                        common action possible? Where are divergent courses indicated? How are
                        differences to be handled?</p>
                    <p>Thus, we face the root questions of a multipolar world. How much unity should
                        we want? How much diversity can we stand? These questions never have a final
                        answer within a pluralistic society. Adjusting <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37"
                            facs="0057"/>the balance between integration and autonomy will be the
                        key challenge of emerging Atlantic relations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV. Bipolarity and Multipolarity: The Conceptual Problem</p>
                    <p>In the years ahead, the most profound challenge to American policy will be
                        philosophical: to develop some concept of order in a world which is bipolar
                        militarily but multipolar politically. But a philosophical deepening will
                        not come easily to those brought up in the American tradition of foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Our political society was one of the few which was consciously created at a
                        point in time. At least until the emergence of the race problem, we were
                        blessed by the absence of conflicts between classes and over ultimate ends.
                        These factors produced the characteristic aspects of American foreign
                        policy: a certain manipulativeness and pragmatism, a conviction that the
                        normal pattern of international relations was harmonious, a reluctance to
                        think in structural terms, a belief in final answers—all qualities which
                        reflect a sense of self-sufficiency not far removed from a sense of
                        omnipotence. Yet the contemporary dilemma is that there are no total
                        solutions; we live in a world gripped by revolutions in technology, values,
                        and institutions. We are immersed in an unending process, not in a quest for
                        a final destination. The deepest problems of equilibrium are not physical
                        but psychological or moral. The shape of the future will depend ultimately
                        on convictions which far transcend the physical balance of power.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The New Nations and Political Legitimacy</hi>. This
                        challenge is especially crucial with respect to the new nations. Future
                        historians are likely to class the confusion and torment in the emerging
                        countries with the great movements of religious awakening. Continents which
                        had been dormant for centuries suddenly develop political consciousness.
                        Regions which for scores of years had considered foreign rule as natural
                        struggle for independence. Yet it is a curious nationalism which defines
                        itself not as in Europe by common language or culture but often primarily by
                        the common experience of foreign rule. Boundaries—especially in Africa—have
                        tended to follow the administrative convenience of the colonial powers
                        rather than linguistic or tribal lines. The new nations have faced problems
                        both of identity and of political authority. They often lack social
                        cohesiveness entirely, or they are split into competing groups, each with a
                        highly developed sense of identity.</p>
                    <p>It is no accident that between the Berlin crisis and the invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia, the principal threats to peace came from the emerging areas.
                        Domestic weakness encourages foreign intervention. The temptation to deflect

                        their local grievances. The rivalry of the superpowers offers many
                        opportunities for blackmail.</p>
                    <p>Yet their relations with other countries are not the most significant aspect
                        of the turmoil of the new countries. It is in the new countries that
                        questions of the purpose of political life and the meaning of political
                        legitimacy—key issues also in the modern state—pose themselves in their most
                        acute form. The new nations weigh little in the physical balance of power.
                        But the forces unleashed in the emergence of so many new states may well
                        affect the moral balance of the world—the convictions which form the
                        structure for the world of tomorrow. This adds a new dimension to the
                        problem of multipolarity.</p>
                    <p>Almost all of the new countries suffer from a revolutionary malaise:
                        revolutions succeed through the coming together of all resentments. But the
                        elimination of existing structures compounds the difficulty of establishing
                        political consensus. A successful revolution leaves as its legacy a profound
                        dislocation. In the new countries, contrary to all revolutionary
                        expectations, the task of construction emerges as less glamorous and more
                        complex than the struggle for freedom; the exaltation of the quest for
                        independence cannot be perpetuated. Sooner or later, positive goals must
                        replace resentment of the former colonial power as a motive force. In the
                        absence of autonomous social forces, this unifying role tends to be
                        performed by the state.</p>
                    <p>But the assumption of this role by the state does not produce stability. When
                        social cohesiveness is slight, the struggle for control of authority is
                        correspondingly more bitter. When government is the principal, sometimes the
                        sole, expression of national identity, opposition comes to be considered
                        treason. The profound social or religious schisms of many of the new nations
                        turn the control of political authority quite literally into a matter of
                        life and death. Where political obligation follows racial, religious, or
                        tribal lines, self-restraint breaks down. Domestic conflicts assume the
                        character of civil war. Such traditional authority as exists is personal or
                        feudal. The problem is to make it “legitimate”—to develop a notion of
                        political obligation which depends on legal norms rather than on coercive
                        power or personal loyalty.</p>
                    <p>This process took centuries in Europe. It must be accomplished in decades in
                        the new nations, where preconditions of success are less favorable than at
                        comparable periods in Europe. The new countries are subject to outside
                        pressures; there is a premium on foreign adventures to bring about domestic
                        cohesiveness. Their lack of domestic structure compounds the already great
                        international instabilities.</p>
                    <p>The American role in the new nations' efforts to build legitimate authority
                        is in need of serious reexamination. The dominant American <pb n="39"
                            xml:id="pg_39" facs="0059"/>view about political structure has been that
                        it will follow more or less automatically upon economic progress and that it
                        will take the form of constitutional democracy.</p>
                    <p>Both assumptions are subject to serious questions. In every advanced country,
                        political stability preceded rather than emerged from the process of
                        industrialization. Where the rudiments of popular institutions did not exist
                        at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, they did not receive their
                        impetus from it. To be sure, representative institutions were broadened and
                        elaborated as the countries prospered, but their significant features
                        antedated economic development and are not attributable to it. In fact, the
                        system of government which brought about industrialization—whether popular
                        or authoritarian—has tended to be confirmed rather than radically changed by
                        this achievement.</p>
                    <p>Nor is democracy a natural evolution of nationalism. In the last century,
                        democracy was accepted by a ruling class whose estimate of itself was
                        founded outside the political process. It was buttressed by a middle class,
                        holding a political philosophy in which the state was considered to be a
                        referee of the ultimately important social forces rather than the principal
                        focus of national consciousness. Professional revolutionaries were rarely
                        involved; their bias is seldom democratic.</p>
                    <p>The pluralism of the West had many causes which cannot be duplicated
                        elsewhere. These included a church organization outside the control of the
                        state and therefore symbolizing the limitation of government power; the
                        Greco-Roman philosophical tradition of justice based on human dignity,
                        reinforced later by the Christian ethic; an emerging bourgeoisie; a
                        stalemate in religious wars imposing tolerance as a practical necessity and
                        a multiplicity of states. Industrialization was by no means the most
                        significant of these factors. Had any of the others been missing, the
                        Western political evolution could have been quite different.</p>
                    <p>This is why Communism has never succeeded in the industrialized Western
                        countries for which its theory was devised; its greatest successes have been
                        in developing societies. This is no accident. Industrialization—in its early
                        phases—multiplies dislocations. It smashes the traditional framework. It
                        requires a system of values which makes the sacrifices involved in capital
                        formation tolerable and which furnishes some integrating principles to
                        contain psychological frustrations.</p>
                    <p>Communism is able to supply legitimacy for the sacrifices inseparably
                        connected with capital formation in an age when the maxims of laissez faire
                        are no longer acceptable. And Leninism has the attraction of providing a
                        rationale for holding on to power. Many of the leaders of the new countries
                        are revolutionaries who sustained themselves through the struggle for
                        independence by visions of the transformations to be brought about after
                        victory. They are not predisposed even <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0060"
                        />to admit the possibility of giving up power in their hour of triumph.
                        Since they usually began their struggle for independence while in a small
                        minority and sustained it against heavy odds, they are not likely to be
                        repelled by the notion that it is possible to “force men to be free.”</p>
                    <p>The ironic feature of the current situation is that Marxism, professing a
                        materialistic philosophy, is accepted only where it does not exist: in some
                        new countries and among protest movements of the advanced democratic
                        countries. Its appeal is its idealistic component and not its economic
                        theory. It offers a doctrine of substantive change and an explanation of
                        final purposes. Its philosophy has totally failed to inspire the younger
                        generation in Communist countries, where its bureaucratic reality is
                        obvious.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the United States, professing an idealistic philosophy,
                        often fails to gain acceptance for democratic values because of its heavy
                        reliance on economic factors. It has answers to technical dislocations but
                        has not been able to contribute much to building a political and moral
                        consensus. It offers a procedure for change but little content for it.</p>
                    <p>The problem of political legitimacy is the key to political stability in
                        regions containing two-thirds of the world's population. A stable domestic
                        system in the new countries will not automatically produce international
                        order, but international order is impossible without it. An American agenda
                        must include some conception of what we understand by political legitimacy.
                        In an age of instantaneous communication, we cannot pretend that what
                        happens to over two-thirds of humanity is of no concern or interest to the
                        United States. This does not mean that our goal should be to transfer
                        American institutions to the new nations—even less that we should impose
                        them. Nor should we define the problem as how to prevent the spread of
                        Communism. Our goal should be to build a moral consensus which can make a
                        pluralistic world creative rather than destructive.</p>
                    <p>Irrelevance to one of the great revolutions of our time will mean that we
                        will ultimately be engulfed by it—if not physically, then psychologically.
                        Already some of the protest movements have made heroes of leaders in
                        repressive new countries. The absurdity of founding a claim for freedom on
                        protagonists of the totalitarian state—such as Guevara or Ho or
                        Mao—underlines the impact of the travail of the new countries on older
                        societies which share none of their technical but some of their spiritual
                        problems, especially the problem of the nature of authority in the modern
                        world. To a young generation in rebellion against bureaucracy and bored with
                        material comfort, these societies offer at least the challenge of unlimited
                        opportunity (and occasionally unlimited manipulativness) in the quest for
                        justice.</p>
                    <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0061"/>
                    <p>A world which is bipolar militarily and multipolar politically thus confronts
                        an additional problem. Side by side with the physical balance of power,
                        there exists a psychological balance based on intangibles of value and
                        belief. The presuppositions of the physical equilibrium have changed
                        drastically; those of the psychological balance remain to be discovered.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Problem of Soviet Intentions.</hi> Nothing has been
                        more difficult for Americans to assimilate in the nuclear age than the fact
                        that even enmity is complex. In the Soviet Union, we confront an opponent
                        whose public pronouncements are insistently hostile. Yet the nuclear age
                        imposes a degree of cooperation and an absolute limit to conflicts.</p>
                    <p>The military relationship with the Soviet Union is difficult enough; the
                        political one confronts us with a profound conceptual problem. A society
                        which regards peace as the normal condition tends to ascribe tension not to
                        structural causes but to wicked or shortsighted individuals. Peace is
                        thought to result either from the automatic operation of economic forces or
                        from the emergence of a more benign leadership abroad.</p>
                    <p>The debate about Soviet trends between “hard-liners” and “soft-liners”
                        illustrates this problem. Both sides tend to agree that the purpose of
                        American policy is to encourage a more benign evolution of Soviet
                        society—the original purpose of containment was, after all, to bring about
                        the <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> transformation of the U.S.S.R. They are
                        at one that a settlement presupposes a change in the Soviet system. Both
                        groups imply that the nature of a possible settlement is perfectly obvious.
                        But the apostles of containment have never specified the American
                        negotiating program to be undertaken from the position of strength their
                        policy was designed to achieve. The advocates of relaxation of tensions have
                        been no more precise; they have been more concerned with atmosphere than
                        with the substance of talks.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the difference between the “hawks” and “doves” has usually concerned
                        timing: the hawks have maintained that a Soviet change of heart, while
                        inevitable, was still in the future, whereas the doves have argued that it
                        has already taken place. Many of the hawks tend to consider all negotiations
                        as fruitless. Many of the doves argue—or did before Czechoslovakia—that the
                        biggest step toward peace has already been accomplished by a Soviet change
                        of heart about the cold war; negotiations need only remove some essentially
                        technical obstacles.</p>
                    <p>The difference affects—and sometimes poisons—the entire American debate about
                        foreign policy. Left-wing critics of American foreign policy seem incapable
                        of attacking U.S. actions without elevating our opponent (whether it happens
                        to be Mao or Castro or Ho) to a pedestal. If they discern some stupidity or
                        self-interest on our side, they <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0062"
                        />assume that the other side must be virtuous. They then criticize the
                        United States for opposing the other side. The right follows the same logic
                        in reverse: they presuppose our good intentions and conclude that the other
                        side must be perverse in opposing us. Both the left and the right judge
                        largely in terms of intentions. In the process, whatever the issue—whether
                        Berlin or Vietnam—more attention is paid to whether to get to the conference
                        room than what to do once we arrive there. The dispute over Communist
                        intentions has diverted attention from elaborating our own purposes. In some
                        quarters, the test of dedication to peace has been whether one interprets
                        Soviet intentions in the most favorable manner.</p>
                    <p>It should be obvious, however, that the Soviet domestic situation is complex
                        and its relationship to foreign policy far from obvious. It is true that the
                        risks of general nuclear war should be as unacceptable to Moscow as to
                        Washington; but this truism does not automatically produce détente. It also
                        seems to lessen the risks involved in local intervention. No doubt the
                        current generation of Communist leaders lacks the ideological dynamism of
                        their predecessors who made the revolution; at the same time, they have at
                        their disposal a military machine of unprecedented strength, and they must
                        deal with a bureaucracy of formidable vested interests. Unquestionably,
                        Soviet consumers press their leaders to satisfy their demands; but it is
                        equally true that an expanding modern economy is able to supply both guns
                        and butter. Some Soviet leaders may have become more pragmatic; but in an
                        elaborated Communist state, the results of pragmatism are complex. Once
                        power is seized and industrialization is largely accomplished, the Communist
                        Party faces a difficult situation. It is not needed to conduct the
                        government, and it has no real function in running the economy (though it
                        tries to do both). In order to justify its continued existence and command,
                        it may develop a vested interest in vigilance against outside danger and
                        thus in perpetuating a fairly high level of tension.</p>
                    <p>It is beyond the scope of this essay to go into detail on the issue of
                        internal Communist evolution. But it may be appropriate to inquire why, in
                        the past, every period of détente has proved stillborn. There have been at
                        least five periods of peaceful coexistence since the Bolshevik seizure of
                        power, one in each decade of the Soviet state. Each was hailed in the West
                        as ushering in a new era of reconciliation and as signifying the
                        long-awaited final change in Soviet purposes. Each ended abruptly with a new
                        period of intransigence, which was generally ascribed to a victory of Soviet
                        hard-liners rather than to the dynamics of the system. There were
                        undoubtedly many reasons for this. But the tendency of many in the West to
                        be content with changes of Soviet tone and to confuse atmosphere with
                        substance surely did not help matters. It has enabled the Communist leaders
                        to postpone the choice <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0063"/>which they
                        must make sooner or later: whether to use détente as a device to lull the
                        West or whether to move toward a resolution of the outstanding differences.
                        As long as this choice is postponed, the possibility exists that latent
                        crises may run away with the principal protagonists, as happened in the
                        Middle East and perhaps even in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>The eagerness of many in the West to emphasize the liberalizing implications
                        of Soviet economic trends and to make favorable interpretation of Soviet
                        intentions a test of good faith may have the paradoxical consequence of
                        strengthening the Soviet hard-liners. Soviet troops had hardly arrived in
                        Prague when some Western leaders began to insist that the invasion would not
                        affect the quest for détente while others continued to indicate a nostalgia
                        for high-level meetings. Such an attitude hardly serves the cause of peace.
                        The risk is great that if there is no penalty for intransigence there is no
                        incentive for conciliation. The Kremlin may use negotiations—including arms
                        control—as a safety valve to dissipate Western suspicions rather than as a
                        serious endeavor to resolve concrete disputes or to remove the scourge of
                        nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>If we focus our policy discussions on Soviet purposes, we confuse the debate
                        in two ways: Soviet trends are too ambiguous to offer a reliable guide—it is
                        possible that not even Soviet leaders fully understand the dynamics of their
                        system; it deflects us from articulating the purposes we should pursue,
                        whatever Soviet intentions. Peace will not, in any event, result from one
                        grand settlement but from a long diplomatic process, and this process
                        requires some clarity as to our destination. Confusing foreign policy with
                        psychotherapy deprives us of criteria by which to judge the political
                        foundations of international order.</p>
                    <p>The obsession with Soviet intentions causes the West to be smug during
                        periods of détente and panicky during crises. A benign Soviet tone is
                        equated with the achievement of peace; Soviet hostility is considered to be
                        the signal for a new period of tension and usually evokes purely military
                        countermeasures. The West is thus never ready for a Soviet change of course;
                        it has been equally unprepared for détente and intransigence.</p>
                    <p>These lines are being written while outrage at the Soviet invasion of
                        Czechoslovakia is still strong. There is a tendency to focus on military
                        implications or to speak of strengthening unity in the abstract. But if
                        history is a guide, there will be a new Soviet peace offensive sooner or
                        later. Thus, reflecting about the nature of détente seems most important
                        while its achievement appears most problematical. If we are not to be doomed
                        to repeat the past, it may be well to learn some of its lessons: we should
                        not again confuse a change of tone with a change of heart. We should not
                        pose false inconsistencies between allied unity and <pb n="44"
                            xml:id="pg_44" facs="0064"/>détente; indeed, a true relaxation of
                        tensions presupposes Western unity. We should concentrate negotiations on
                        the concrete issues that threaten peace, such as intervention in the third
                        world. Moderating the arms race must also be high on the agenda. None of
                        this is possible without a concrete idea of what we understand by peace and
                        a creative world order.</p>
                    <p rend="center">V. An Inquiry Into the American National Interest</p>
                    <p>Wherever we turn, then, the central task of American foreign policy is to
                        analyze anew the current international environment and to develop some
                        concepts which will enable us to contribute to the emergence of a stable
                        order.</p>
                    <p>First, we must recognize the existence of profound structural problems that
                        are to a considerable extent independent of the intentions of the principal
                        protagonists and that cannot be solved merely by good will. The vacuum in
                        Central Europe and the decline of the Western European countries would have
                        disturbed the world equilibrium regardless of the domestic structure of the
                        Soviet Union. A strong China has historically tended to establish suzerainty
                        over its neighbors; in fact, one special problem of dealing with
                        China—Communism apart—is that it has had no experience in conducting foreign
                        policy with equals. China has been either dominant or subjected.</p>
                    <p>To understand the structural issue, it is necessary to undertake an inquiry,
                        from which we have historically shied away, into the essence of our national
                        interest and into the premises of our foreign policy. It is part of American
                        folklore that, while other nations have interests, we have responsibilities;
                        while other nations are concerned with equilibrium, we are concerned with
                        the legal requirements of peace. We have a tendency to offer our altruism as
                        a guarantee of our reliability: “We have no quarrel with the Communists,”
                        Secretary of State Rusk said on one occasion; “all our quarrels are on
                        behalf of other people.”</p>
                    <p>Such an attitude makes it difficult to develop a conception of our role in
                        the world. It inhibits other nations from gearing their policy to ours in a
                        confident way—a “disinterested” policy is likely to be considered
                        “unreliable.” A mature conception of our interest in the world would
                        obviously have to take into account the widespread interest in stability and
                        peaceful change. It would deal with two fundamental questions: What is it in
                        our interest to prevent? What should we seek to accomplish?</p>
                    <p>The answer to the first question is complicated by an often-repeated
                        proposition that we must resist aggression anywhere it occurs since peace is
                        indivisible. A corollary is the argument that we do not oppose the fact of
                        particular changes but the method by which they are brought <pb n="45"
                            xml:id="pg_45" facs="0065"/>about. We find it hard to articulate a truly
                        vital interest which we would defend however “legal” the challenge. This
                        leads to an undifferentiated globalism and confusion about our purposes. The
                        abstract concept of aggression causes us to multiply our commitments. But
                        the denial that our interests are involved diminishes our staying power when
                        we try to carry out these commitments.</p>
                    <p>Part of the reason for our difficulties is our reluctance to think in terms
                        of power and equilibrium. In 1949, for example, a State Department
                        memorandum justified <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as follows: “[The
                            treaty]<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">All brackets in the source
                            text.</note> obligates the parties to defend the purposes and principles
                        of the United Nations, the freedom, common heritage and civilization of the
                        parties and their free institutions based upon the principles of democracy,
                        individual liberty and the role of law. It obligates them to act in defense
                        of peace and security. It is directed against no one; it is directed solely
                        against aggression. It seeks not to influence any shifting balance of power
                        but to strengthen a balance of principle.”</p>
                    <p>But principle, however lofty, must at some point be related to practice;
                        historically, stability has always coincided with an equilibrium that made
                        physical domination difficult. Interest is not necessarily amoral; moral
                        consequences can spring from interested acts. Britain did not contribute any
                        the less to international order for having a clear-cut concept of its
                        interest which required it to prevent the domination of the Continent by a
                        single power (no matter in what way it was threatened) and the control of
                        the seas by anybody (even if the immediate intentions were not hostile). A
                        new American administration confronts the challenge of relating our
                        commitments to our interests and our obligations to our purposes.</p>
                    <p>The task of defining positive goals is more difficult but even more
                        important. The first two decades after the end of the Second World War posed
                        problems well suited to the American approach to international relations.
                        Wherever we turned, massive dislocations required attention. Our pragmatic,
                        ad hoc tendency was an advantage in a world clamoring for technical
                        remedies. Our legal bent contributed to the development of many instruments
                        of stability.</p>
                    <p>In the late sixties, the situation is more complex. The United States is no
                        longer in a position to operate programs globally; it has to encourage them.
                        It can no longer impose its preferred solution; it must seek to evoke it. In
                        the forties and fifties, we offered remedies; in the late sixties and in the
                        seventies our role will have to be to contribute to a structure that will
                        foster the initiative of others. We are a superpower physically, but our
                        designs can be meaningful only if they generate willing cooperation. <pb
                            n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0066"/>We can continue to contribute to
                        defense and positive programs, but we must seek to encourage and not stifle
                        a sense of local responsibility. Our contribution should not be the sole or
                        principal effort, but it should make the difference between success and
                        failure.</p>
                    <p>This task requires a different kind of creativity and another form of
                        patience than we have displayed in the past. Enthusiasm, belief in progress,
                        and the invincible conviction that American remedies can work everywhere
                        must give way to an understanding of historical trends, an ordering of our
                        preferences, and above all an understanding of the difference our
                        preferences can in fact make.</p>
                    <p>The dilemma is that there can be no stability without equilibrium but,
                        equally, equilibrium is not a purpose with which we can respond to the
                        travail of our world. A sense of mission is clearly a legacy of American
                        history; to most Americans, America has always stood for something other
                        than its own grandeur. But a clearer understanding of America's interests
                        and of the requirements of equilibrium can give perspective to our idealism
                        and lead to humane and moderate objectives, especially in relation to
                        political and social change. Thus our conception of world order must have
                        deeper purposes than stability but greater restraints on our behavior than
                        would result if it were approached only in a fit of enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>Whether such a leap of the imagination is possible in the modern bureaucratic
                        state remains to be seen. New administrations come to power convinced of the
                        need for goals and for comprehensive concepts. Sooner, rather than later,
                        they find themselves subjected to the pressures of the immediate and the
                        particular. Part of the reason is the pragmatic, issue-oriented bias of our
                        decision-makers. But the fundamental reason may be the persuasiveness of
                        modern bureaucracy. What started out as an aid to decision-making has
                        developed a momentum of its own. Increasingly, the policy-maker is more
                        conscious of the pressures and the morale of his staff than of the purpose
                        this staff is supposed to serve. The policy-maker becomes a referee among
                        quasi-autonomous bureaucratic bodies. Success consists of moving the
                        administrative machinery to the point of decision, leaving relatively little
                        energy for analyzing the decision's merit. The modern bureaucratic state
                        widens the range of technical choices while limiting the capacity to make
                        them.</p>
                    <p>An even more serious problem is posed by the change of ethic of precisely the
                        most idealistic element of American youth. The idealism of the fifties
                        during the <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> era expressed
                        itself in self-confident, often zealous, institution building. Today,
                        however, many in the younger generation consider the management of power
                        irrelevant, perhaps even immoral. While the idea of service retains a potent
                        influence, it does so largely with respect to problems which are clearly not
                        connected <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0067"/>with the strategic aspects
                        of American foreign policy; the Peace Corps is a good example. The new ethic
                        of freedom is not “civic”; it is indifferent or even hostile to systems and
                        notions of order. Management is equated with manipulation. Structural
                        designs are perceived as systems of “domination”—not of order. The
                        generation which has come of age after the fifties has had Vietnam as its
                        introduction to world politics. It has no memory of occasions when
                        American-supported structural innovations were successful or of the
                        motivations which prompted these enterprises.</p>
                    <p>Partly as a result of the generation gap, the American mood oscillates
                        dangerously between being ashamed of power and expecting too much of it. The
                        former attitude deprecates the use or possession of force; the latter is
                        overly receptive to the possibilities of absolute action and overly
                        indifferent to the likely consequences. The danger of a rejection of power
                        is that it may result in a nihilistic perfectionism which disdains the
                        gradual and seeks to destroy what does not conform to its notion of utopia.
                        The danger of an overconcern with force is that policy-makers may respond to
                        clamor by a series of spasmodic gestures and stylistic maneuvers and then
                        recoil before their implications.</p>
                    <p>These essentially psychological problems cannot be overemphasized. It is the
                        essence of a satisfied, advanced society that it puts a premium on operating
                        within familiar procedures and concepts. It draws its motivation from the
                        present, and it defines excellence by the ability to manipulate an
                        established framework. But for the major part of humanity, the present
                        becomes endurable only through a vision of the future. To most
                        Americans—including most American leaders—the significant reality is what
                        they see around them. But for most of the world—including many of the
                        leaders of the new nations—the significant reality is what they wish to
                        bring about. If we remain nothing but the managers of our physical
                        patrimony, we will grow increasingly irrelevant. And since there can be no
                        stability without us, the prospects of world order will decline.</p>
                    <p>We require a new burst of creativity, however, not so much for the sake of
                        other countries as for our own people, especially the youth. The
                        contemporary unrest is no doubt exploited by some whose purposes are all too
                        clear. But that it is there to exploit is proof of a profound
                        dissatisfaction with the merely managerial and consumer-oriented qualities
                        of the modern state and with a world which seems to generate crises by
                        inertia. The modern bureaucratic state, for all its panoply of strength,
                        often finds itself shaken to its foundations by seemingly trivial causes.
                        Its brittleness and the world-wide revolution of youth—especially in
                        advanced countries and among the relatively affluent—suggest a spiritual
                        void, an almost metaphysical boredom with a political environment <pb n="48"
                            xml:id="pg_48" facs="0068"/>that increasingly emphasizes bureaucratic
                        challenges and is dedicated to no deeper purpose than material comfort.</p>
                    <p>Our unrest has no easy remedy. Nor is the solution to be found primarily in
                        the realm of foreign policy. Yet a deeper nontechnical challenge would
                        surely help us regain a sense of direction. The best and most prideful
                        expressions of American purposes in the world have been those in which we
                        acted in concert with others. Our influence in these situations has depended
                        on achieving a reputation as a member of such a concert. To act consistently
                        abroad we must be able to generate coalitions of shared purposes. Regional
                        groupings supported by the United States will have to take over major
                        responsibility for their immediate areas, with the United States being
                        concerned more with the over-all framework of order than with the management
                        of every regional enterprise.</p>
                    <p>In the best of circumstances, the next administration will be beset by
                        crises. In almost every area of the world, we have been living off
                        capital—warding off the immediate, rarely dealing with underlying problems.
                        These difficulties are likely to multiply when it becomes apparent that one
                        of the legacies of the war in Vietnam will be a strong American reluctance
                        to risk overseas involvements.</p>
                    <p>A new administration has the right to ask for compassion and understanding
                        from the American people. But it must found its claim not on pat technical
                        answers to difficult issues; it must above all ask the right questions. It
                        must recognize that, in the field of foreign policy, we will never be able
                        to contribute to building a stable and creative world order unless we first
                        form some conception of it.</p>

                    <p>In a campaign speech delivered in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 6, 1968, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> proposed a “new diplomacy” to
                        deal with future aggression:</p>
                    <p>“Since World War II ended, the United States has been actively involved in
                        two major wars to defend the freedom of other lands from Communist
                        aggression. We fought in Korea and we are fighting in Vietnam. In these
                        conflicts, America has taken more than a quarter of a million casualties,
                        and fifty thousand dead. In both wars, the United <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49"
                            facs="0069"/>States provided most of the money, most of the arms and
                        most of the men to defend these countries. The efforts that were made were
                        right in my view, but I believe it is time now for a new diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>“While we are the richest nation and the most powerful nation in the
                        non-Communist world, we must remember that we are only two hundred million
                        Americans, and there are two billion people in the non-Communist world. It
                        is time to develop a new diplomacy for the United States, a diplomacy to
                        deal with future aggression—so that when the freedom of friendly nations is
                        threatened by aggression, we help them with our money and help them with our
                        arms; but we let them fight the war and don't fight the war for them. This
                        should be the goal of a new diplomacy for America.” (<persName

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> offered his perspective
                        on prospects for détente with the Soviet Union in his acceptance speech at
                        the Republican convention in Miami Beach, Florida, on August 8, 1968:</p>
                    <p>“And now to the leaders of the Communist world, we say: After an era of
                        confrontation, the time has come for an era of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>“Where the world's super powers are concerned, there is no acceptable
                        alternative to peaceful negotiation.</p>
                    <p>“Because this will be a period of negotiation, we shall restore the strength
                        of America so that we shall always negotiate from strength and never from
                        weakness.</p>
                    <p>“So we begin with the proposition that if we are to have peace we must
                        negotiate. If we are to negotiate we must negotiate from strength. If we are
                        to have strength we must restore the strength of the United States and also
                        we must restore the strength of the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>“Despite the recent setbacks, the years just ahead can bring a breakthrough
                        for peace, they must be a time of careful probing, of intensive
                        negotiations, of a determined search for those areas of accommodation
                        between East and West on which a climate of mutual trust can eventually be
                        built. But this can only succeed if Western strength is sufficient to back
                        up our diplomacy. As one of Europe's leading statesmen has phrased it:
                        ‘genuine détente presupposes security; it does not replace it’.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0070"/>
                    <p>“First, the United States must be strong. We've got to make sure that our
                        president will always be able to negotiate from strength. He must negotiate
                        with the leaders of the Soviet because in today's nuclear world there is no
                        alternative to negotiation. The Soviet Union knows it and we know it. And
                        that is why I will re-establish the strength of the United States, not only
                        here, but re-establish also the strength of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                    <p>On October 7, 1968, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>
                        addressed a conference organized by United Press International in
                        Washington. In the course of his remarks, he argued for shifting the burden
                        of fighting in Vietnam to the South Vietnamese forces:</p>
                    <p>“I would put far greater emphasis, as the present command in Vietnam is now
                        beginning to do, on the training of the South Vietnamese to fight their own
                        battles and on giving the South Vietnamese people other than the military
                        something to fight for rather than something simply to be against.</p>
                    <p>“It is a cruel irony that the American effort to safeguard the independence
                        of South Vietnam has produced an ever-increasing dependency in our ally. If
                        South Vietnam's future is to be secure, this process must now be
                        reversed.</p>
                    <p>“At the same time, we need far greater and more urgent attention to training
                        the South Vietnamese themselves, and equipping them with the best of modern
                        weapons. As they are phased in, American troops can be phased out. This
                        phasing-out will save American lives and cut American costs. Further, it is
                        essential if South Vietnam is to develop both the military strength and the
                        strength of spirit to survive now and in the future.” (<hi rend="italic">

                    <p>Secretary of State-designate <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William
                            Rogers</persName> testified on January 15, 1969, before the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee, which was meeting in executive session to
                        consider <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' qualifications to be
                        Secretary of State. The confirmation hearing was chaired by Senator
                            <persName>J. William Fulbright</persName> of Arkansas. Fulbright began
                        by questioning <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> about his views
                        on a variety of issues he might deal with as Secretary, and in the process
                        asked him to assess the prospects for achieving détente with the Soviet
                        Union:</p>
                    <p>“The Chairman. What I really think I am driving at is, there is this
                        different view, one is that any kind of co-existence with Russia over a long
                        period is impossible. This is what you seem to gather from previous views of
                        the Secretary of Defense, at least according to some of the press. I don't
                        take any responsibility of knowing what it is, but this has been in the
                        press and in quotes in his book.</p>
                    <p>“We know that gentleman in the past, and I am sure in the future, is
                        extremely important in foreign policy. And here you are and there they are.
                        I mean the reconciliation of these views and they are different, if you feel
                        there is a possibility of co-existence and gradual mellowness, mellowing of
                        the relations between the Russians and ourselves or do you feel it is
                        hopeless and there is no way of having a compromise with the devil?</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. Well, I wouldn't want to
                        agree with what may be your premise about what Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> thinks.</p>
                    <p>“The Chairman. I don't state that as an affirmative matter.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. I am not sure.</p>
                    <p>“The Chairman. I state that as having been said in the press.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. But I would be glad to
                        comment on my own attitude on it. I think that we have to have hope in that
                        regard. If we don't, conflict is inevitable, and I think that the Soviet
                        Union is going to some day come to the conclusion that they have to get
                        along with the rest of the world and with us in particular, and I think that
                        there are many hopeful signs now, aside from what they say, which may make
                        that possible.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“First I think the Sino-Soviet split is probably one of the most
                            important things that has happened in international relations since the
                            takeover of mainland China, and they are obviously tremendously
                            concerned about that.</item>
                        <item>“Secondly, I think they are having difficulty, obviously they are
                            having difficulty, in the socialist countries, and I think that the
                            justification that they advance for the invasion of Czechoslovakia is
                            going to be <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0072"/>one of the most
                            difficult things for them to live with in the future that I can imagine.
                            I mean if you listen to what they say in the United Nations about
                            self-determination, the right of sovereignty and the right of people to
                            solve their own problems and all these things, and then look at what
                            they said as a justification of Czechoslovakia you know they are in an
                            impossible position when it gets down to thoughtful people, and some of
                            these nations in the world are watching very carefully.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>“So I think that it is a good time probably, as soon as the impact of
                        Czechoslovakia wears off a little bit, it is a good thing to try to probe
                        for initiatives toward peace. So I have hope in that regard.”</p>
                    <p>Later in the hearing, the discussion turned to a similar concern when Senator
                        Jacob Javits of New York asked for <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName>' views on the possibility of reconciliation with
                        China:</p>
                    <p>“The other thing I wanted to ask you, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName>, is also a matter of basic philosophy because it
                        epitomizes whether this must result in war or is there a way out, is what do
                        you think about the possibilities with Communist China? Do you see the
                        possibility of any way that we have of bringing about some reconciliation
                        with this enormous body of people or must it just be fought out with one or
                        the other really [finally?] yielding?</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. Well, Senator, I don't
                        suppose anybody can answer that question with any degree of certainty. I
                        would not want anything that I say to reflect on past decisions. I think it
                        is important to develop channels of communications with Red China, if it is
                        possible and as soon as it is possible, and I think to a large extent that
                        depends on their attitude. Certainly we should be willing to, and I think
                        the President-elect has indicated a very strong desire in that direction.
                        And as you know there has—the Red Chinese have proposed a meeting in Warsaw
                        in February sometime, and we obviously will pursue that initiative. But in
                        answer to your question what they intend to do I don't believe I can do
                        that.</p>
                    <p>“You know, I think in the long run you can't have a billion people outside
                        the world community. It just doesn't make any sense. What we can do to
                        further their becoming peaceful and constructive factors in world affairs is
                        I think beyond anybody's ability to predict. But I certainly think we should
                        try, in every way we can but we should be sensible about it and recognize
                        the practicalities as they exist.”</p>
                    <p>Senator Javits concluded his questioning by asking how <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> perceived his prospective role as
                        Secretary of State:</p>
                    <p>“Senator Javits. That brings me to my last question. I think you
                        misunderstood. You thought I was asking you what you thought they felt. My
                        last question is do you <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0073"/>conceive of
                        your role as Secretary of State to be an activist role or a protected role?
                        In other words, do you conceive of your role as being solely to safeguard
                        the interests of the United States throughout the world or do you conceive
                        of your role also as being an active force for peace in the world on the
                        theory that if there is peace in the world this is to the great satisfaction
                        of our country and that we must have initiatives and be leaders and really
                        try to move the world toward peace even though it involves risk on our
                        part.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>. Well, as you know the
                        Constitution is silent on the Secretary of State. The duties of the
                        Secretary of State are spelled out in an Act of 1789 which would say that he
                        will perform such activities that are enjoined and entrusted to him by the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>“Now, I would hesitate to characterize my attitude except to say, whether I
                        am an activist or protector or whatever, but I think that the role has to be
                        assumed, and I have assumed it with this in mind, to do everything possible
                        to make the world more secure, safer for people, and to hopefully bring
                        about peace and I think the Secretary of State should advise the President
                        actively to achieve this end. If I didn't think so I wouldn't have taken the
                        job.” (Nomination of <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P.

                        January 20, 1969, was the search for peace:</p>
                    <p>“As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward
                        together with all mankind.</p>
                    <p>“Let us take as our goal: Where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where
                        peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it
                        permanent.</p>
                    <p>“After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.</p>
                    <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0074"/>
                    <p>“Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of
                        communication will be open.</p>
                    <p>“We seek an open world—open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and
                        people—a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry
                        isolation.</p>
                    <p>“We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to make no one
                        our enemy.</p>
                    <p>“Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition—not
                        in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of
                        man.</p>
                    <p>“As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together—not
                        as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared.</p>
                    <p>“With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of
                        arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the
                        hungry.</p>
                    <p>“But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt
                        that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.</p>
                    <p>“Over the past 20 years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman
                        Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world. I have come to
                        know the leaders of the world and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears
                        that divide the world.</p>
                    <p>“I know that peace does not come through wishing for it—that there is no
                        substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>“I also know the people of the world.</p>
                    <p>“I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in
                        battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know these have no
                        ideology, no race.</p>
                    <p>“I know America. I know the heart of America is good.</p>
                    <p>“I speak from my own heart, and the heart of my country, the deep concern we
                        have for those who suffer and those who sorrow.</p>
                    <p>“I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to
                        uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. To that oath I now
                        add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my Office, my energies, and
                        all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among nations.</p>
                    <p>“Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike:</p>
                    <p>“The peace we seek—the peace we seek to win—is not victory over any other
                        people, but the peace that comes ‘with healing in its wings’; <pb n="55"
                            xml:id="pg_55" facs="0075"/>with compassion for those who have suffered;
                        with understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for
                        all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny.</p>
                    <p>“Only a few short weeks ago we shared the glory of man's first sight of the
                        world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>“As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve,
                        they spoke to us of the beauty of earth—and in that voice so clear across
                        the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its goodness.</p>
                    <p>“In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to
                        write: ‘To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in
                        that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the
                        earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal
                        cold—brothers who know now they are truly brothers.’</p>
                    <p>“In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their
                        thoughts toward home and humanity—seeing in that far perspective that man's
                        destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into
                        the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself, in our
                        own hands, in our own hearts.</p>
                    <p>“We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch
                        the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark.
                        Let us gather the light.</p>
                    <p>“Our destiny offers not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity.
                        So let us seize it not in fear, but in gladness—and ‘riders on the earth
                        together,’ let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose,
                        cautious of the dangers, but sustained by our confidence in the will of God
                        and the promise of man.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mel:</p>
                    <p>I have been giving much thought to our relations with the Soviet Union and
                        would like to give you, informally, my ideas on this central security
                        problem. My purpose in doing so is not to prejudge the scheduled systematic
                        review by the National Security Council of our policy options with respect
                        to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but rather to set out the
                        general approach which I believe should guide us in our conduct as we move
                        from confrontation to negotiation.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>I believe that the tone of our public and private discourse about and
                            with the Soviet Union should be calm, courteous and non-polemical. This
                            will not prevent us from stating our views clearly and, if need be,
                            firmly; nor will it preclude us from candidly affirming our
                            attitude—negatively if warranted—toward the policies and actions of the
                            Soviet Union. But what I said in my Inaugural address concerning the
                            tone and character of our domestic debates should also govern the tone
                            and character of our statements in the international arena, most
                            especially in respect of the Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">In

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I believe that the basis for a viable settlement is a mutual
                            recognition of our vital interests. We must recognize that the Soviet
                            Union has interests; in the present circumstances we cannot but take
                            account of them in defining our own. We should leave the Soviet
                            leadership in no doubt that we expect them to adopt a similar approach
                            toward us. This applies also to the concerns and interests of our allies
                            and indeed of all nations. They, too, are entitled to the safeguarding
                            of their legitimate interests. In the past we have often attempted to
                            settle things in a fit of enthusiasm, relying on personal diplomacy. But
                            the “spirit” that permeated various meetings lacked a solid basis of
                            mutual interest and, therefore, every summit meeting was followed by a
                            crisis in less than a year.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I am convinced that the great issues are fundamentally interrelated. I
                            do not mean by this to establish artificial linkages between specific
                                <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0077"/>elements of one or another
                            issue or between tactical steps that we may elect to take. But I do
                            believe that crisis or confrontation in one place and real cooperation
                            in another cannot long be sustained simultaneously. I recognize that the
                            previous Administration took the view that when we perceive a mutual
                            interest on an issue with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, we
                            should pursue agreement and attempt to insulate it as much as possible
                            from the ups and downs of conflicts elsewhere. This may well be sound on
                            numerous bilateral and practical matters such as cultural or scientific
                            exchanges. But, on the crucial issues of our day, I believe we must seek
                            to advance on a front at least broad enough to make clear that we see
                            some relationship between political and military issues. I believe that
                            the Soviet leaders should be brought to understand that they cannot
                            expect to reap the benefits of cooperation in one area while seeking to
                            take advantage of tension or confrontation elsewhere. Such a course
                            involves the danger that the Soviets will use talks on arms as a safety
                            valve on intransigence elsewhere. I note, for example, that the invasion
                            of Hungary was followed by abortive disarmament talks within nine
                            months. The invasion of Czechoslovakia was preceded by the explorations
                            of a summit conference (in fact, when Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> informed President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, he
                            received the appointment so quickly because the President thought his
                            purpose was to fix the date of a summit meeting). Negotiation and the
                            search for agreement carry their own burdens; the Soviets—no less than

                        <item>I recognize the problem of giving practical substance to the
                            propositions set forth in the previous paragraph. Without attempting to
                            lay down inflexible prescriptions about how various matters at issue
                            between ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                            be connected, I would like to illustrate what I have in mind in one case
                            of immediate and widespread interest—the proposed talks on strategic
                            weapons. I believe our decision on when and how to proceed does not
                            depend exclusively on our review of the purely military and technical
                            issues, although these are of key importance. This decision should also
                            be taken in the light of the prevailing political context and, in
                            particular, in light of progress toward stabilizing the explosive Middle
                            East situation, and in light of the Paris talks. I believe I should
                            retain the freedom to ensure, to the extent that we have control over
                            it, that the timing of talks with the Soviet Union on strategic weapons
                            is optimal. This may, in fact, mean delay beyond that required for our
                            review of the technical issues. Indeed, it means that we should—at least
                            in our public position—keep open the option that there may be no talks
                            at all.</item>

                        <item>I am of course aware that the Soviets are seeking to press us to agree
                            to talks and I know also of the strong views held by many in this

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> discussed the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's perception
                        of the linkage between political and strategic issues during a background
                        briefing for the press at the White House on February 6, 1969:</p>
                    <p>“Q. Can you tell us more about why the President wants to have strategic
                        negotiations and political negotiations going forward on separately
                        different facts [tracks?]?</p>
                    <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I was lured here
                        because I was told you all could hardly wait to hear me expound on the
                        National Security Council system and my exerted influence on it.</p>
                    <p>“To take the question of the linkage between the political and the strategic
                        environment. We have come through two phases. In the 1950's, it used to be
                        said that a political settlement had to precede an arms settlement. It was
                        said that the arms race is the result of political tensions, not the cause
                        of them, and, therefore, the way to deal with the problems of arms was to
                        solve first all the political problems and then the arms would take care of
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>“In reaction to that, they developed an arms control school in which you and
                        I participated in various stages as colleagues in which the argument used to
                        be that the arms race portion was essentially autonomous with producing
                        tension and in which the level of political tension was more or less
                        irrelevant to what could be done in the arms field.</p>
                    <p>“This led to about ten years of negotiations in the arms field which have had
                        some successes, of which the Non-Proliferation Treaty is one, but during
                        which, I think it is fair to say, that the level of arms has increased
                        substantially, both quantitatively and qualitatively and the level of
                        tension has also increased substantially.</p>
                    <p>“Now, if you review the last 20 years and look at the incidents that
                        significantly increase the dangers of war, I think it would be difficult to
                            <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0079"/>think of one that was caused by
                        the general balance of arms. But it is possible to think of very many that
                        were caused by the general balance of political relationships.</p>
                    <p>“Therefore, the President's view is not that there must be a settlement of
                        all political issues. He has emphatically rejected that in his press
                        conference before this. His view is, if I understand it correctly, that
                        there is a danger, that if arms control and political issues become too much
                        disassociated that arms control may be used as a safety valve to make
                        political conflict safer rather than eliminate political conflict.</p>
                    <p>“He has, therefore, suggested that there be enough movement in the political
                        field to indicate that the arms control negotiations do not unwittingly,
                        instead of reducing the danger of war, offer a means by which political
                        conflict can be intensified and yet managed. He is asking for enough
                        movement, not to produce a final settlement, but to indicate that there is
                        enough good faith in the direction of trying to reduce the intensity of
                        political conflict.</p>
                    <p>“In short, he would like to deal with the problem of peace on the entire
                        front in which peace is challenged and not only on the military one.”

                        and deliberately, the President expressed the hope that the meetings could
                        be used for both the traditional end of “briefing” the leadership, and a
                        secondary end of providing a channel through which the Administration might
                        receive the views of the men of power on the Hill.</p>
                    <p>On Europe, and the coming trip, the President said he was under no illusions
                        that grand tours or “abrazos” or a “new spirit” would resolve basic
                        differences between adversaries, or even allies. He was going, he said,
                        because several basic problems of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        require immediate attention, because he believed that past administrations
                        had not paid adequate “attention” to Europe, because the views of these
                        Western partners had not been given adequate consideration in the past, even
                        in negotiating the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. There was a need for
                        “more consultation in advance.”</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the President had the feeling that perhaps American leadership in
                        the past had been looking “too much to collateral areas” and not enough to
                        what, “some still call the blue chip.”</p>
                    <p>Third, there were very great substantive differences between the allies and
                        the President's trip might establish a basis for “continuing consultation”
                        on such issues as the Mideast. Fourth, going there has a “symbolic
                        importance.” We will be “prepared to discuss anything,” the President noted,
                        adding that some fifty hours of discussions are currently scheduled in the
                        eight-day trip.</p>
                    <p>At the close of his monologue, the President cautioned against unjustifiable
                        optimism. We have to recognize, he said, that basic disagreements are not
                        going to be solved by meetings, with these meetings, however, we can reduce
                        to a minimum those disagreements which result from a lack of communication
                        or consultation.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of the possibility of adding a stop in Malta to
                        the President's European agenda, and a discussion of how to handle the
                        question of ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with the
                        West German Government.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">Arms Control</p>
                    <p>The President now gave his detailed views on reports in the press—from his
                        first press conference—that he had irrevocably linked progress <pb n="61"
                            xml:id="pg_61" facs="0081"/>in arms talks with progress on political
                        problems—so tightly as to make progress in one a “condition” of progress
                        with the other.</p>
                    <p>Not so, the President said. Certainly, we want to move on them both at the
                        same time, since the history of wars shows that arms races are occasionally
                        a cause of conflict, but in far more instances, it is a political problem
                        that produces the war, and not the level of armaments.</p>
                    <p>The President wanted progress in both at the same time, but he wanted to
                        emphasize that progress in one is not “a condition” of progress in the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Soviets, the President pointed out quite clearly that if
                        Soviet aid to North Vietnam were halted, or Soviet assistance to the “more
                        aggressive neighbors” of Israel were halted, the problems would be reduced
                        to a level where they would not require any American intervention. Thus the
                        Soviets did have the “big stroke” in helping to resolve these political
                        problems.</p>

                        progress was really being made. He had not done this because he felt it was
                        necessary to have very careful planning for a meeting at the summit, there
                        had been the spirit of Glassboro, of Vienna and of Camp
                            <persName>David</persName> and these hopes had been dashed. It was

                        basically like us. He felt that it would be a mistake for the President of
                        the United States to go to a meeting without knowing what we were going to
                        talk about or where we were going. <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0082"
                        />This would simply raise hopes that would subsequently be dashed.
                        Consequently he believed that we should have talks first with our friends
                        and allies including France. The Soviets had interest in talks on the
                        limitation of strategic weapons. This was a matter that could affect the
                        capability of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in Europe.
                        Another reason for not rushing into arms talks was that it was generally
                        claimed that an arms race increased the risk of war. He thought it was clear
                        that both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would like to reduce the financial burden on
                        themselves. He wished to make clear that on this matter he would not make
                        the decision in this matter on a financial basis, the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> had to be able to afford whatever security required. One had
                        to recognize a historic fact that wars also were caused by political
                        tensions. If a freeze on strategic arms were to take place an explosion
                        would still occur in the Middle East, at Berlin or in Vietnam and this could
                        lead to war. He felt that this opportunity should be seized by the new
                        administration and he shared the General's view that détente was desirable.
                        However we should be hard and pragmatic in dealing with the Soviets. They
                        knew what they wanted and we must know what we want. While we would not make
                        talks on Middle East and other matters a condition for talks on limitation
                        of strategic weapons, we did feel that it was proper to suggest at
                        Ambassadorial level as indeed we had that we felt that we should try and
                        make progress on all fronts to achieve a détente. We should talk in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the framework of the Four Powers on
                        the Middle East and discuss later what could be done there. We would like
                        the Soviets' help on solving the Vietnamese problem, we realized that their
                        situation in this matter was delicate with the Chinese but the Soviets did
                        have great influence on the North Vietnamese. After all 85 percent of their
                        weapons came from the Soviet Union. Perhaps we could also make some progress
                        in the Central [Europe?] area on Berlin. Not of course a solution as neither
                        side could give enough to settle the matter; we could perhaps make some
                        progress. The President said he would like to know the General's opinion
                        whether he thought we were correct in proceeding cautiously in asking the
                        Soviets to talk on several areas rather than discussing only limitation of
                        strategic weapons with them. The reason why the President was opposed to an
                        agreement on arms limitation only without progress on political issues such
                        as the Middle East, Europe and Vietnam was because such an agreement would
                        create a sort of euphoria of peace.</p>
                    <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said he felt that
                        the President was quite right. A détente was the only acceptable policy. One
                        must be cautious and not speak of everything at once, nor should one be
                        overly polite and make concessions to them. The French who had started the
                        policy of détente with them had never made any concessions even on Germany
                        and they certainly had reasons to do so but had not. Now France was on much
                            <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0083"/>better terms with the Soviets and
                        had made no concessions to them. Practically if the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> were to start conversations on political subjects as well as
                        on strategic missiles—<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and so forth—and
                        if contact could be made with them on other subjects such as Vietnam and the
                        Middle East he felt that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could do this
                        with all prudence and dignity. He believed that the President should not
                        rush to Moscow and lay out the red carpet before <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> but that the President was quite right in seeking
                        to have adequate preparations made in advance.” (Memorandum of conversation;

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met again with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> on March 1, 1969,
                        at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles. Among the topics discussed was
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s desire to develop
                        “parallel relationships” with China and the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>“The President said that if the General agreed they might talk for an hour on
                        Sunday [March 2]. He would like to have the General's views at that time on
                        Vietnam and Southeast Asia. By that time the President would have been
                        briefed by Lodge and his team. There was one other matter about which they
                        might talk if time permitted. In 1963 when he had talked to the General, and
                        he was talking privately now, not for public announcements that might
                        embarrass the Soviet Union, whether it might not be wise to develop lines of
                        communications with the Soviets and the Chinese and so to speak not put all
                        of our eggs in one basket. There was considerable sentiment in the U.S.
                        State Dept, not only in favor of a Soviet-U.S. détente but also for a lineup
                        of the Soviets, Europe and the U.S. against Chinese. His own view was that
                        while this might be a good short-range policy, he felt that for the longer
                        range it was more important to recognize that our interests might perhaps
                        best be served by recognizing that China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> were two great powers <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64"
                            facs="0084"/>and it might be better to develop parallel relationships
                        with them. This was of course in some measure largely theoretical as it was
                        difficult to have relations with the Chinese.”</p>
                    <p>After a digression on developments in Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        returned to a discussion of the possibility of improving relations with
                        China without adversely affecting relations with the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> then said that they
                        had been talking about China. What about the possibility of relations with
                        China and how would this affect relationships with the Soviets? Some said
                        that one should try and play the Chinese off against the Soviets and try to
                        divide them. Others felt that it was worth trying to improve relations with
                        both. The French had relations with the Chinese and it had not brought them
                        much advantage except perhaps economically and a bit culturally, but mostly
                        economically and in some cases some exchanges. They had some and might
                        perhaps have more. The Chinese had great economic requirements and
                        diplomatic relations facilitated economic relations. The French had renewed
                        relations with China but had not expected much of it as the Chinese had
                        appeared to be in a state of ebullition. The Cultural Revolution had been
                        accompanied by great agitation and they had done nothing else except
                        agitate. This was not satisfactory for political relations with them. They
                        now appeared to be calming down and returning to a more normal situation. He
                        believed that there was advantage in having relations with them. They were a
                        huge entity and certainly had great resources. They were working and making
                        progress in industry, in technology, in nuclear matters. They had ambitions
                        and actions everywhere, even in Paris, in Africa and in Asia. As time passed
                        they would have more political weight. What attitude should we adopt—that of
                        isolating them and letting them cook in their own juice—of having no opening
                        or contacts with them? He had no illusions but did not feel that we should
                        isolate them in their own rage. We should have exchanges at all levels and
                        we might eventually see the beginnings of a détente. How this would affect
                        the Soviets was difficult to know. The Soviets usually recommended that one
                        should have normal relations with the Chinese. They had such relations
                        themselves even though these were not always easy. That, however, was their
                        business. The West should try to get to know China, to have contacts and to
                        penetrate it. We should try to get them to sit at the table with us and
                        offer them openings. The French felt that this was the best policy and we
                        could see what conclusions could be drawn. If the U.S. began to have
                        relations with China this would mean that China would probably get into the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This would have much effect and a lot
                        of dust would be stirred up but he did not believe that the overall results
                        would be bad. The Prime Minister queried on this but the General agreed with
                        him.</p>
                    <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0085"/>
                    <p>“The President said that he had talked to [André] Malraux on the previous
                        evening. He had seen Mao on the eve of the Cultural Revolution and Mao had
                        said that he had to stir up everything otherwise China would go to
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that as he saw it, there were two policies which might be
                        followed, a short range policy and a long range policy. In the short range
                        policy there could be no changes for a number of reasons relating to their
                        impact on Asia. On a long range policy he felt that it would be detrimental
                        to the interests of the U.S. in 10 years for it to appear that the West was
                        ganging up with the Soviet Union against China. He felt that it was
                        important for the French to extend their communications and keep a line open
                        into China and in looking down the road towards talks with the Soviet Union
                        we might keep an anchor to windward with respect to China. This did not mean
                        that we would do anything so crude as to suggest we play China off against
                        the Soviet Union. The Soviets would resent this bitterly. In 10 years when
                        China had made significant nuclear progress we would have to have more
                        communications than we had today.</p>
                    <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> said that the
                        French already had relations with the Chinese and it would be better for the
                        U.S. to recognize China before they were obliged to do it by the growth of
                        China. He felt that this would be better and that was why the French had
                        chosen to do it earlier.” (Memorandum of conversation; National Archives,

                    <p>On March 4, 1969, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        invited Congressional leaders to the White House to brief them on the
                        results of his trip to Western Europe. In the course of the briefing,
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> discussed the defense of
                        the Western alliance and his inclination to rely upon a “flexible
                        response.”</p>
                    <p>“The President now discussed two different theories of Western strategy,
                        which have been adopted at one time or another by Western leaders.</p>
                    <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0086"/>
                    <p>“The first is the theory that any conflict in Europe between East and West
                        will inevitably result in a nuclear exchange, and thus all that is needed in
                        the way of American forces there is a ‘trip wire,’ a ‘few battalions.’ This
                        has some strong proponents, the President said (although using the argument
                        he did not refer it as ‘massive retaliation’). However, ‘would an American
                        President’ deliver a nuclear strike on the Soviets if they moved into West
                        Berlin, he said. Let's assume they did move in and occupy Berlin. We may
                        want a ‘flexible response.’ The existence of conventional ground forces
                        could have some military effect there, for us—but an ‘enormous political
                        effect.’ There is even a question of whether we need to have more options
                        available to us militarily in Europe than we now have, the President
                        said.</p>
                    <p>“(To sum up briefly, it appeared to this observer that the President quite
                        clearly had rejected the notion of massive retaliation, even should the
                        Soviets move in force into West Berlin. He had opted instead for a ‘flexible
                        response’ for a range of weapons which we might employ. One of the
                        advantages of having our troops in Germany was thus military options, but
                        more important was the enormous political effect they provided.)</p>
                    <p>“However, the President noted, it was simply a hard fact that the American
                        military commitment of five-and-a-third or six divisions or whatever it is
                        cannot continue ad infinitum. We did not threaten the Europeans with any
                        withdrawal, but we did make clear the above fact.” (Notes on the meeting

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                        >Smith</persName>:</p>
                    <p>In view of the great importance which I attach to the work of the Eighteen
                        Nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva, I wish to address directly to you,
                        as the new Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the head
                        of our delegation, my instructions regarding the participation of the United
                        States in this conference.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental objective of the United States is a world of enduring peace
                        and justice, in which the differences that separate nations can be resolved
                        without resort to war.</p>
                    <p>Our immediate objective is to leave behind the period of confrontation and to
                        enter an era of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>The task of the Delegation of the United States to the disarmament conference
                        is to serve these objectives by pursuing negotiations to achieve concrete
                        measures which will enhance the security of our own country and all
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The new Administration has now considered the policies which will help us to
                        make progress in this endeavor.</p>
                    <p>I have decided that the Delegation of the United States should take these
                        positions at the Conference.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, in order to assure that the seabed, man's latest frontier,
                            remains free from the nuclear arms race, the United States delegation
                            should indicate that the United States is interested in working out an
                            international agreement that would prohibit the implacement or fixing of
                            nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on the seabed. To
                            this end, the United States Delegation should seek discussion of the
                            factors necessary for such an international agreement. Such an agreement
                            would, like the Antarctic Treaty and the Treaty on Outer Space<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">The Antarctic Treaty was signed December 1,
                                1959 (12 UST; TIAS 4780) and the Treaty on Outer Space was signed
                                January 27, 1967 (18 UST; TIAS 6347).</note> which are already in
                            effect, prevent an arms race before it had a chance to start. It would
                            ensure that this potentially useful area of the world remained available
                            for peaceful purposes.</item>
                        <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0088"/>
                        <item>Second, the United States supports the conclusion of a comprehensive
                            test ban adequately verified. In view of the fact that differences
                            regarding verification have not permitted achievement of this key arms
                            control measure, efforts must be made towards greater understanding of
                            the verification issue.</item>
                        <item>Third, the United States Delegation will continue to press for an
                            agreement to cut off the production of fissionable materials for weapons
                            purposes and to transfer such materials to peaceful purposes.</item>
                        <item>Fourth, while awaiting the United Nations Secretary General's study on
                            the effects of chemical and biological warfare, the United States
                            Delegation should join with other delegations in exploring any proposals
                            or ideas that could contribute to sound and effective arms control
                            relating to these weapons.</item>
                        <item>Fifth, regarding more extensive measures of disarmament, both nuclear
                            and conventional, the United States Delegation should be guided by the
                            understanding that actual reduction of armaments, and not merely
                            limiting their growth or spread, remains our goal.</item>
                        <item>Sixth, regarding the question of talks between the United States and
                            the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic arms, the United States
                            hopes that the international political situation will evolve in a way
                            which will permit such talks to begin in the near future.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In carrying out these instructions, the United States Delegation should keep
                        in mind my view that efforts toward peace by all nations must be
                        comprehensive. We cannot have realistic hopes for significant progress in
                        the control of arms if the policies of confrontation prevail throughout the
                        world as the rule of international conduct. On the other hand, we must
                        attempt to exploit every opportunity to build a world of peace—to find areas
                        of accord—to bind countries together in cooperative endeavors.</p>
                    <p>A major part of the work of peace is done by the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament
                        Committee. I expect that all members of the United States Delegation will
                        devote that extra measure of determination, skill, and judgment which this
                        high task merits.</p>
                    <p>I shall follow closely the progress that is made and give my personal
                        consideration to any problems that arise whenever it would be helpful for me
                        to do so.</p>
                    <p>Please convey to all your colleagues my sincere wishes for success in our
                        common endeavor. Over the years, their achievements at the Eighteen-Nation
                        Disarmament Conference have been outstanding. I am confident that in the
                        future our efforts, in cooperation with theirs, will be equal to any
                        challenge and will result in progress for the benefit of all.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <head>17. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>In a meeting with Australian Prime Minister <persName>John Gorton</persName>
                        at the White House on April 1, 1969, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> cited the domino theory in expressing his concern
                        about the possible effects of a precipitate United States withdrawal from
                        Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>“The President said the so-called domino theory is spoken of disparagingly
                        these days, but in fact our posture in Viet-Nam affects the countries of
                        Southeast Asia; countries such as Japan, which would not wish to see a
                        solution in Viet-Nam that encouraged the ‘hawks’ of the Communist world, and
                        in fact our whole relationship with the Communist powers on the world scene.
                        The Viet-Nam war poisons our relations with certain European countries, the
                        President said; they are not interested in it and do not care about it. The
                        Latin American countries tend to feel the same way. Domestic opposition is
                        substantial. Nevertheless we must persevere in our effort to achieve a
                        workable peace, orchestrating the diplomatic and military instruments we
                        have at hand for the purpose. He said one point that bears emphasis is that
                        we cannot achieve an effective peace without the cooperation of the
                        South-Vietnamese. President Thieu is coming along well and is quite
                        reasonable, but he cannot be rushed unduly.” (Memorandum of conversation;

                    <p>Twenty years ago, as has already been mentioned, a few dedicated men gathered
                        in Washington to cement an Atlantic partnership between the older nations of
                        Europe and their offspring in the New World—and in this very room the North
                        Atlantic Treaty was signed. Some of the men who were here then are here
                        today—and I would like to suggest that those who were here then and who are
                        here today stand for a moment. [Applause]<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3"

                    <p>Gentlemen, with our hindsight, we now have saluted your foresight at that
                        time. In referring to that event, I thought I should share with you the
                        conversation that I had with some of the founders in the room prior to
                        coming to this meeting.</p>

                            State, 1949-1953.</note> recalled that before the signing of the treaty
                        the Marine Band played “We've Got Plenty of Nothing” and “It Ain't
                        Necessarily So.”</p>
                    <p>Certainly what has happened in those 20 years proved that as far as the music
                        was concerned, it was not prophetic.</p>
                    <p>As we sit here today we also look back on those 20 years, what has happened,
                        and we think, as the previous speakers have indicated, of all of those who
                        have contributed to the Alliance and particularly to the one who commanded
                        the armies that liberated Europe, the first Supreme Commander of the forces

                        always been more than a military alliance that its strength has been greater
                        than the strength of arms. This Alliance represents a moral force which, if
                        we marshal it, will ennoble our efforts.</p>
                    <p>Dwight Eisenhower was a great humanist. He was also a great realist. If he
                        were with us today, he would have recognized that together, as men of the
                        Old World and of the New World, we must find ways of living in the real
                        world.</p>
                    <p>As we know too well, that real world today includes men driven by suspicion,
                        men who would take advantage of their neighbors, men who confuse the pursuit
                        of happiness with the pursuit of power.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0091"/>
                    <p>It also is peopled with men of good will, with men of peace and with men of
                        hope and with men of vision.</p>
                    <p>No nation, and no community of nations, is made up entirely of one group of
                        men or another. No part of the world has a monopoly on wisdom or virtue.</p>
                    <p>Those who think simply in terms of “good” nations and “bad” nations—of a
                        world of staunch allies and sworn enemies—live in a world of their own.
                        Imprisoned by stereotypes, they do not live in the real world.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, those who believe that all it takes to submerge national
                        self-interest is a little better communication, those who think that all
                        that stands in the way of international brotherhood is stubborn
                        leadership—they, too, live in a world of their own. Misled by wishful
                        thinking, they do not live in the real world.</p>
                    <p>Two decades ago, the men who founded <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        faced the truth of their times; as a result, the Western world prospers
                        today in freedom. We must follow their example by once again facing the
                        truth—not of earlier times, but of our own times.</p>
                    <p>Living in the real world of today means recognizing the sometimes differing
                        interests of the Western nations, while never losing sight of our great
                        common purposes.</p>
                    <p>Living in the real world of today means understanding old concepts of East
                        versus West, understanding and unfreezing those concepts, but never losing
                        sight of great ideological differences that still remain.</p>
                    <p>We can afford neither to blind our eyes with hatred nor to distort our vision
                        with rose-colored glasses. The real world is too much with us to permit
                        either stereotyped reacting or wishful thinking to lay waste our powers.</p>
                    <p>Let us then count ourselves today among the hopeful realists.</p>
                    <p>In this same spirit of hopeful realism, let us look at <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> today.</p>
                    <p>We find it strong but we find it challenged. We find disputes about its
                        structure, political divisions among its members, and reluctance to meet
                        prescribed force quotas. Many people on both sides of the Atlantic today
                        find <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> anachronistic, something quaint
                        and familiar and even a bit old-fashioned.</p>
                    <p>As the Alliance begins its third decade, therefore, there are certain
                        fundamentals to be reaffirmed: <list>
                            <item>First, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is needed; and the
                                American commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will
                                remain in force and it will remain strong. We in America continue to
                                consider Europe's security to be our own.</item>
                            <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0092"/>
                            <item>Second, having succeeded in its original purpose, the Alliance
                                must adapt to the conditions of success. With less of the original
                                cement of fear, we must forge new bonds to maintain our
                                unity.</item>
                            <item>Third, when <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was founded, the
                                mere fact of cooperation among the Western nations was of tremendous
                                significance, both symbolically and substantively. Now the symbol is
                                not enough; we need substance. The Alliance today will be judged by
                                the content of its cooperation, not merely by its form.</item>
                            <item>Fourth, the allies have learned to harmonize their military
                                forces; now, in the light of the vast military, economic, and
                                political changes of two decades, we must devise better means of
                                harmonizing our policies.</item>
                            <item>Fifth, by its nature, ours is more than a military alliance; and
                                the time has come to turn a part of our attention to those
                                nonmilitary areas in which we all could benefit from increased
                                collaboration.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, what does all this mean for the future of the Western Alliance?</p>
                    <p>To deal with the real world, we cannot respond to changing conditions merely
                        by changing our words. We have to adapt our actions.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough to talk of flexible response, if at the same time we reduce
                        our flexibility by cutting back on conventional forces.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough to talk of relaxing tension, unless we keep in mind the fact
                        that 20 years of tension were not caused by superficial misunderstandings. A
                        change of mood is useful only if it reflects some change of mind about
                        political purpose.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough to talk of European security in the abstract. We must know
                        the elements of insecurity and how to remove them. Conferences are useful if
                        they deal with concrete issues which means they must, of course, be
                        carefully prepared.</p>
                    <p>It is not enough to talk of détente, unless at the same time we anticipate
                        the need for giving it the genuine political content that would prevent
                        détente from becoming delusion.</p>
                    <p>To take one example, a number of America's Western partners have actively
                        supported the idea of strategic arms control talks with the Soviet Union. I
                        support that idea. When such talks are held, we shall work diligently for
                        their success.</p>
                    <p>But within our Alliance we must recognize that this would imply a military
                        relationship far different from the one that existed when <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was founded. Let's put it in plain words.
                        The West does not today have the massive nuclear predominance that it once
                        had, and any sort of broad-based arms agreement with the Soviets would
                        codify the present balance.</p>
                    <p>How would progress towards arms control affect the nature of consultation
                        within our Alliance?</p>
                    <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>Up to now, our discussions have mainly had to do with tactics—ways and means
                        of carrying out the provisions of a treaty drawn a generation ago. We have
                        discussed clauses in proposed treaties; in the negotiations to come, we must
                        go beyond these to the processes which these future treaties will set in
                        motion. We must shake off our preoccupation with formal structure to bring
                        into focus a common world view.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there is a diversity of policies and interests among the Western
                        nations; and, of course, those differences must be respected. But in shaping
                        the strategies of peace, these differences need not block the way—not if we
                        break through to a new and deeper form of political consultation.</p>
                    <p>To be specific, the forthcoming arms talks will be a test of the ability of
                        the Western nations to shape a common strategy.</p>
                    <p>The United States fully intends to undertake deep and genuine consultation
                        with its allies, both before and during any negotiations directly affecting
                        their interests. That is a pledge I shall honor—and I expect to consult at
                        length on the implications of anything that might affect the pattern of
                        East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>In passing that test together, this Alliance will give new meaning to the
                        principle of mutual consultation.</p>
                    <p>To seize the moment that this opportunity presents, we would do well to
                        create new machinery for Western political consultation, as well as to make
                        greater use of the machinery that we have.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, I suggest that deputy foreign ministers meet periodically for a
                            high-level review of major, long-range problems before the
                            Alliance.</item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Second, I suggest creation of a special political planning group, not
                                to duplicate the work now being done by the Council or by the senior
                                political advisers, but to address itself specifically and
                                continually to the longer-range problems we face.</p>
                            <p>This would by no means preclude efforts to develop a fuller European
                                cooperation. On the contrary, we in the United States would welcome
                                that cooperation. What ties us to Europe is not weakness or division
                                among our partners but community of interest with them.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>Third, I strongly urge that we create a committee on the challenges of
                            modern society, responsible to the deputy ministers, to explore ways in
                            which the experience and resources of the Western nations could most
                            effectively be marshaled toward improving the quality of life of our
                            peoples.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>That new goal is provided for in Article II of our treaty, but it has never
                        been the center of our concerns. Let me put my proposal in concrete terms
                        and in personal terms. On my recent trip to Europe I met with world leaders
                        and private citizens alike. I was struck by the fact <pb n="74"
                            xml:id="pg_74" facs="0094"/>that our discussions were not limited to
                        military or political matters. More often than not our talks turned to those
                        matters deeply relevant to our societies—the legitimate unrest of young
                        people, the frustration of the gap between generations, the need for a new
                        sense of idealism and purpose in coping with an automating world.</p>
                    <p>These were not subjects apart from the concerns of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>; indeed they went to the very heart of the real world we
                        live in. We are not allies because we are bound by treaty; we bind ourselves
                        by treaty because we are allied in meeting common purposes and common
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>For 20 years, our nations have provided for the military defense of Western
                        Europe. For 20 years we have held political consultations.</p>
                    <p>Now the alliance of the West needs a third dimension.</p>
                    <p>It needs not only a strong military dimension to provide for the common
                        defense, and not only a more profound political dimension to shape a
                        strategy of peace, but it also needs a social dimension to deal with our
                        concern for the quality of life in this last third of the 20th century.</p>
                    <p>This concern is manifested in many ways, culturally and technologically,
                        through the humanities and the sciences.</p>
                    <p>The Western nations share common ideals and a common heritage. We are all
                        advanced societies, sharing the benefits and the gathering torments of a
                        rapidly advancing industrial technology. The industrial nations share no
                        challenge more urgent than that of bringing 20th century man and his
                        environment to terms with one another—of making the world fit for man, and
                        helping man to learn how to remain in harmony with the rapidly changing
                        world.</p>
                    <p>We in the United States have much to learn from the experiences of our
                        Atlantic allies in their handling of internal matters: for example, the care
                        of infant children in West Germany, the “new towns” policy of Great Britain,
                        the development of depressed areas programs in Italy, the great skill of the
                        Dutch in dealing with high density areas, the effectiveness of urban
                        planning by local governments in Norway, the experience of the French in
                        metropolitan planning.</p>
                    <p>Having forced a working partnership, we all have a unique opportunity to pool
                        our skills, our intellects, and our inventiveness in finding new ways to use
                        technology to enhance our environments, and not to destroy them.</p>
                    <p>The work of this committee would not be competitive with any now being
                        carried on by other international agencies. Neither would it be our purpose
                        to limit this cooperation and the benefits that flow from it to our own
                        countries. Quite the opposite; our purpose would be to share both ideas and
                        benefits, recognizing that these problems have no <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75"
                            facs="0095"/>national or regional boundaries. This could become the most
                        positive dimension of the Alliance, opening creative new channels to all the
                        rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>When I visited the North Atlantic Council in Brussels I posed the question:
                        “In today's world, what kind of an alliance shall we strive to build”?</p>
                    <p>Today I have sketched out some of the approaches that I believe the Alliance
                        should take.</p>
                    <p>I believe we must build an Alliance strong enough to deter those who might
                        threaten war, close enough to provide for continuous and far-reaching
                        consultation, trusting enough to accept the diversity of views, realistic
                        enough to deal with the world as it is, and flexible enough to explore new
                        channels of constructive cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Ten years ago, addressing the North Atlantic Council in this same room,
                        President Eisenhower spoke of the need for unity. Listen to his words: There
                        is not much strength in the finger of one hand, he said, but when five
                        fingers are balled into a fist, you have a considerable instrument of
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>We need such an instrument of defense and the United States will bear its
                        fair share in keeping <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strong.</p>
                    <p>All of us are also ready, as conditions change, to turn that fist into a hand
                        of friendship.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> means more than arms, troop levels,
                        consultative bodies, and treaty commitments. All of these are necessary. But
                        what makes them relevant to the future is what the Alliance stands for. To
                        discover what this Western Alliance means today, we have to reach back, not
                        across two decades, but through the centuries to the very roots of the
                        Western experience.</p>
                    <p>When we do, we find that we touch a set of elemental ideals, eloquent in
                        their simplicity, majestic in their humanity, ideals of decency and justice
                        and liberty and respect for the rights of our fellow men. Simple, yes; and
                        to us they seem obvious. But our forebears struggled for centuries to win
                        them and in our own lifetimes we have had to fight to defend them.</p>
                    <p>These ideals are what <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was created to
                        protect. It is to these ideals, on this proud anniversary, that we are
                        privileged to consecrate the Alliance anew. These ideals—and the firmness of
                        our dedication to them—give <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s concept
                        its nobility, and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s backbone its
                        steel.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of trade issues, particularly as they bore on
                        agricultural exports. The focus of the discussion was Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>' upcoming trip to Europe.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Samuels</persName> suggested that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> stress “outwardness” rather than
                        “inwardness” in trade policy. “Americans and Europeans have had some
                        protectionist problems in the short run, but we have to make clear that this
                        policy cannot be permanent.” The President added, “Our mid-western friends
                        here in America will stick with us on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        but if we start fooling around with their soy beans, their votes are gone.
                        Maury [<persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>], if I were you, I would
                        point out the growing isolationism in America. There's Vietnam, there are
                        the obvious failures in foreign aid—overlooking the places it succeeded—and
                        also there is the concern here with our own cities.</p>
                    <p>“There is no question about what the new leadership stands for,” the
                        President continued, “but we face a political problem at home. If the
                        American people get the impression that the European economy is turning
                        inward, the Europeans can forget about political cooperation; no
                        administration could survive supporting their case.</p>
                    <p>“This isolationism is a troublesome trend,” the President went on. “The
                        people are saying now ‘Why don't we cut the military budget? Why not bring
                        home the divisions in Europe?’ The next step could be ‘Let the rest of the
                        world go hang.’ Of course, that would be a disastrous policy in the long
                        run, but the Europeans and the Japanese have to understand that the string
                        is running out. Maury, you have to use great discretion on this and not
                        refer to it publicly at all. But tell them our problem. They don't hesitate
                        to tell us theirs.”</p>

                    <p>The following item concerning “U.S. Power” appeared in the President's April
                        10th News Summary: “The U.S. has lost ‘the desire and ability’ to be the
                        dominant power in the world, Britain's Institute for Strategic Studies said.
                        In the past year Russia has become the ‘full equal’ of the United States in
                        military and political terms and is likely to overtake America in Inter
                        Continental Ballistic Missiles by mid-1969. It said, however, that with its
                        great stock of submarines and planes the United States will nevertheless
                        retain a lead in total number of nuclear weapons. The survey predicted the
                        possibility of a less active American role in the world in the 1970s—maybe
                        the smallest U.S. international role since before World War II. ‘It was
                        largely accidental that the end of the American desire and ability to be the
                        universal and dominant power should coincide with the end of eight years of
                        Democrat rule,’ the survey said. This course is not due to a choice of
                        Americans of ‘isolation for its own sake, but because their recent
                        experience at home and abroad, had exhausted their confident sense of
                        purpose and ability.’”</p>

                    <head>21. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On April 21, 1969, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> defined administration policy objectives in Asia in
                        an address at the annual luncheon of the Associated Press in New York City.
                        He used the address to send another signal of the administration's desire
                        for improved relations with China:</p>
                    <p>“One cannot speak of a future Pacific community without reference to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>“The United States Government understands perfectly well that the Republic of
                        China on the island of Taiwan and Communist China on the mainland are both
                        facts of life.</p>
                    <p>“We know that by virtue of its size, population, and the talents of its
                        people, mainland China is bound to play an important role in East Asian and
                        Pacific affairs.</p>
                    <p>“We have attempted to maintain a dialogue with the leaders of Communist China
                        through periodic meetings in Warsaw; and we were disappointed 2 months ago
                        when those leaders saw fit to cancel at the last moment a continuation of
                        those talks.</p>
                    <p>“We have made a number of specific suggestions—an exchange of journalists, a
                        relaxation of travel restrictions, the sale of grain and pharmaceuticals—in
                        the hope that such steps would lead to a better climate between us. We
                        regret that these overtures have been rejected—and that the leaders of
                        Communist China have elected instead to attack the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration public
                        pronouncements.</p>
                    <p>“Of course we recognize and have treaty relations with the Republic of China,
                        which plays a responsible and constructive role in the international
                        community. Whatever may be the ultimate resolution of the dispute between
                        the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the
                        mainland, we believe strongly it must be brought about by peaceful
                        means.</p>
                    <p>“As things stand now, Communist China is in trouble domestically and
                        externally. The present leaders look with enmity or suspicion upon their
                        neighbors. They are hostile toward the United Nations; hostile toward the
                        United States; hostile toward the Soviet Union; and have shown little
                        interest in normal diplomatic relations with other countries. They still
                        preach violence as a permanent way of life.</p>
                    <p>“We can expect all this to change with time. Not even a nation as large as
                        mainland China can live forever in isolation from a world of interdependent
                        states.</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0099"/>
                    <p>“Meanwhile, we shall take initiatives to reestablish more normal relations
                        with Communist China and we shall remain responsive to any indications of
                        less hostile attitudes from their side.”</p>
                    <p>In the course of his address, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                        also summarized the administration's objective of shifting the burden of
                        combat in Vietnam to South Vietnam forces:</p>
                    <p>“The United States is committed to achieving a peace in Viet-Nam which will
                        permit the people of South Viet-Nam to determine their own future, free from
                        outside interference by anyone.</p>
                    <p>“That is our objective. It has been stated many times. It is known to all
                        concerned. It is not subject to change.</p>
                    <p>“The South Vietnamese, together with the five allies who responded to their
                        appeal for help, have denied the North Vietnamese Communists the military
                        victory they were seeking. Together we have safeguarded the right of the
                        people in the South to make their own decisions.</p>
                    <p>“The leaders in Hanoi know that they cannot win by military means.</p>
                    <p>“That is why there is a new sense of self-confidence in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>“And that is why we can now be deeply engaged, as we are, in an intensive
                        program of upgrading the equipment and combat capability of the armed forces
                        of the Republic of Viet-Nam so they are able to take over an ever larger
                        measure of their own defense.</p>
                    <p>“I want to emphasize that this is something that the leaders of South
                        Viet-Nam very much want—and have so stated publicly and privately.</p>
                    <p>“This, of course, is what we want, too.</p>
                    <p>“The readiness of replacement forces, the level of offensive actions by the
                        enemy, or progress in the Paris peace talks will determine the scope and
                        timing of actual transfers of responsibility—and the consequent release of
                        our forces.</p>
                    <p>“In Paris we have put forward concrete proposals for bringing an end to armed
                        conflict in Viet-Nam. These proposals have been drawn up on the assumption
                        that the leaders of North Viet-Nam are, in fact, now prepared to negotiate
                        an end to the war. On this assumption, we seek to negotiate the withdrawal
                        of all outside combat forces from the territory of South Viet-Nam. This
                        process of troop withdrawal cannot get started by postulating abstract
                        propositions. It cannot get started by taking last things first. It must
                        begin at the beginning.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        before policy decisions were made in Washington. He also reported positive
                        reactions to his emphasis on four economic freedoms as the basis for dealing

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's
                        determination to “Vietnamize” the combat in Vietnam was balanced by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s concern that a
                        rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam would lead to an isolationist
                        reaction. In a conversation on May 12, 1969, with Singapore Prime Minister
                        Lee Kwan Yew at the White House, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> expressed his concern:</p>
                    <p>“The President said that he is personally quite familiar with the high stakes
                        in Asia. A pull-out of the American forces precipitously would be disastrous
                        for Asia, including countries like Japan and India. Europe would be
                        affected. But, the most serious effect would be in the <pb n="81"
                            xml:id="pg_81" facs="0101"/>United States. When a great power fails, it
                        deeply affects the will of the people. While the public would welcome peace
                        initially, they would soon be asking why we pulled out and this would in
                        turn lead an attack on the leadership and establishment and the U.S. role in
                        the war. Isolation could easily be the consequence.</p>
                    <p>“The President assured Lee that we are going to hold the line in Vietnam. We
                        would make reasonable proposals for peace but never agree to a disguised
                        defeat.” (Memorandum of conversation; National Archives, <persName

                    <p>On May 15, 1969, the National Security Council's Senior Review Group, chaired
                        by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, met to consider
                        U.S. China policy. The discussion addressed the question of how to balance
                        relations with China and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> “wondered whether we really wanted China to be a
                        world power like the Soviet Union, competing with us, rather than their
                        present role which is limited to aiding certain insurgencies.”</p>
                    <p>“Nutter mentioned Sino-Soviet difficulties and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> suggested that this was a key issue. What is our
                        view of the evolution of Sino-Soviet relations, how much can we influence
                        them, should we favor one or the other, etc. Brown noted that China thinks
                        that we favor the Soviet Union, while Unger suggested that present policy
                        gives us the flexibility to take advantage of Sino-Soviet developments.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the Soviets
                        and Chinese each think we are playing with the other.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added: “Some
                        Kremlinologists believe that any attempt to better our relations with China
                        will ruin those with the Soviet Union. History suggested to him that it is
                        better to align yourself with the weaker, not the stronger of two
                        antagonistic partners. It is not clear to him that you achieve better
                        relations with the Soviets necessarily because of a hard policy toward China
                        and vice versa. Everyone agrees that we wish to reduce the risk of war with
                        700 million people, but the question is whether alignment with the Soviets,
                        more conciliatory posture toward China or some combination would best
                        achieve this end.” <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0102"/>(Minutes of Senior

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> briefed a joint
                        meeting of the National Security Council and the Cabinet on May 15, 1969, on
                        the televised speech on Vietnam he had delivered the previous evening.
                        During the briefing, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> summarized
                        his objectives and strategy in pursuing a settlement to the conflict:</p>
                    <p>“In a summary statement, the President began by pointing out that the end of
                        World War II was delayed by the insistence on unconditional surrender. If
                        the enemy knows there is no way out but military defeat, he has nothing to
                        gain by offering a settlement. What we have provided is a way out. On the
                        other side of the coin, some people feel that it is only necessary to put
                        out a proposal to get peace. What must be realized is that we are talking to
                        an enemy whose first objective is not peace. They want South Vietnam. So if
                        we are going to get genuine negotiations, just putting out a proposal is not
                        enough. We needed to threaten that if they don't talk they will suffer.</p>
                    <p>“The President listed four principal factors in the U.S. position. One, we
                        are for peace—we are reasonable. Two, we aim to convince the enemy that if
                        there is no settlement, we have an option which is military action not only
                        at the present level but at an expanded level. Three, we want to make clear
                        that they can't win by sitting us out. Four, we want to convince them that
                        they aren't going to get what they want by erosion of the will of the U.S.
                        So, said the President, we have offered them a way out. We have tried to
                        indicate that we will not tolerate a continuation of their fight-talk
                        strategy. We have tried to convince them that the time is coming when South
                        Vietnam will be strong enough to <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0103"
                        />handle a major part of the load. Beyond all this, said the President, it
                        was necessary to give the impression to the enemy that the people of the
                        U.S. are going to support a sound peace proposal and not accept peace at any
                        price. Then and only then will the enemy realize that the war must be
                        ended.” (Memorandum of National Security Council/Cabinet Meeting, drafted by

                    <p>Americans have for many years debated the issues of foreign aid largely in
                        terms of our own national self-interest.</p>
                    <p>Certainly our efforts to help nations feed millions of their poor help avert
                        violence and upheaval that would be dangerous to peace.</p>
                    <p>Certainly our military assistance to allies helps maintain a world in which
                        we ourselves are more secure.</p>
                    <p>Certainly our economic aid to developing nations helps develop our own
                        potential markets overseas.</p>
                    <p>And certainly our technical assistance puts down roots of respect and
                        friendship for the United States in the court of world opinion.</p>
                    <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0104"/>
                    <p>These are all sound, practical reasons for our foreign aid programs.</p>
                    <p>But they do not do justice to our fundamental character and purpose. There is
                        a moral quality in this Nation that will not permit us to close our eyes to
                        the want in this world, or to remain indifferent when the freedom and
                        security of others are in danger.</p>
                    <p>We should not be self-conscious about this. Our record of generosity and
                        concern for our fellow men, expressed in concrete terms unparalleled in the
                        world's history, has helped make the American experience unique. We have
                        shown the world that a great nation must also be a good nation. We are doing
                        what is right to do.</p>
                    <p rend="center">A Fresh Approach</p>
                    <p>This Administration has intensively examined our programs of foreign aid. We
                        have measured them against the goals of our policy and the goad of our
                        conscience. Our review is continuing, but we have come to this central
                        conclusion:</p>
                    <p>U.S. assistance is essential to express and achieve our national goals in the
                        international community—a world order of peace and justice.</p>
                    <p>But no single government, no matter how wealthy or well-intentioned, can by
                        itself hope to cope with the challenge of raising the standard of living of
                        two-thirds of the world's people. This reality must not cause us to retreat
                        into helpless, sullen isolation. On the contrary, this reality must cause us
                        to redirect our efforts in four main ways:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We must enlist the energies of private enterprise</hi>,
                        here and abroad, in the cause of economic development. We must do so by
                        stimulating additional investment through businesslike channels, rather than
                        offering ringing exhortations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We must emphasize innovative technical assistance</hi>, to
                        ensure that our dollars for all forms of aid go further, and to plant the
                        seeds that will enable other nations to grow their own capabilities for the

                    <p>To accomplish these goals, this Administration's foreign aid proposals will
                        be submitted to the Congress today. [Omitted here are elaboration of the
                        four points listed above, an outline of the administration's budget requests
                        for foreign assistance, and notice of the President's <pb n="85"
                            xml:id="pg_85" facs="0105"/>intention to appoint a non-governmental task
                        force to review and make recommendations on foreign assistance
                        programs.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">Toward a World of Order</p>
                    <p>Foreign aid cannot be viewed in isolation. That is a statement with a double
                        meaning, each side of which is true.</p>
                    <p>If we turn inward, if we adopt an attitude of letting the underdeveloped
                        nations shift for themselves, we would soon see them shift away from the
                        values so necessary to international stability. Moreover, we would lose the
                        traditional concern for humanity which is so vital a part of the American
                        spirit.</p>
                    <p>In another sense, foreign aid must be viewed as an integral part of our
                        overall effort to achieve a world order of peace and justice. That order
                        combines our sense of responsibility for helping those determined to defend
                        their freedom; our sensible understanding of the mutual benefits that flow
                        from cooperation between nations; and our sensitivity to the desires of our
                        fellow men to improve their lot in the world.</p>
                    <p>In this time of stringent budgetary restraint, we must stimulate private
                        investment and the cooperation of other governments to share with us in
                        meeting the most urgent needs of those just beginning to climb the economic
                        ladder. And we must continue to minimize the immediate impact on our balance
                        of payments.</p>
                    <p>This request for foreign economic and military assistance is the lowest
                        proposed since the program began. But it is about 900 million dollars more
                        than was appropriated last year. I consider it necessary to meet essential
                        requirements now, and to maintain a base for future action.</p>
                    <p>The support by the Congress of these programs will help enable us to press
                        forward in new ways toward the building of respect for the United States,
                        security for our people and dignity for human beings in every corner of the
                        globe.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President's introductory remarks in which he warned the
                        graduating class that they were beginning their military careers at a
                        difficult time. He told them that they would have to be prepared to risk
                        their lives in a limited war while facing those at home who questioned the
                        need for a strong national defense and saw a danger in the power of the
                        military.]</p>
                    <p>This paradox of military power is a symptom of something far deeper that is
                        stirring in our body politic. It goes beyond the dissent about the war in
                        Vietnam. It goes beyond the fear of the “military-industrial complex.”</p>
                    <p>The underlying questions are really these: What is America's role in the
                        world? What are the responsibilities of a great nation toward protecting
                        freedom beyond its shores? Can we ever be left in peace if we do not
                        actively assume the burden of keeping the peace?</p>
                    <p>When great questions are posed, fundamental differences of opinion come into
                        focus. It serves no purpose to gloss over these differences, or to try to
                        pretend that they are mere matters of degree. Because there is one school of
                        thought that holds that the road to understanding with the Soviet Union and
                        Communist China lies through a downgrading of our own alliances and what
                        amounts to a unilateral reduction of our arms in order to demonstrate our
                        “good faith.”</p>
                    <p>They believe that we can be conciliatory and accommodating only if we do not
                        have the strength to be otherwise. They believe that America will be able to
                        deal with the possibility of peace only when we are unable to cope with the
                        threat of war.</p>
                    <p>Those who think that way have grown weary of the weight of free world
                        leadership that fell upon us in the wake of World War II. They argue that
                        we—that the United States is as much responsible for the tensions in the
                        world as the adversaries we face.</p>
                    <p>They assert that the United States is blocking the road to peace by
                        maintaining its military strength at home and its defenses abroad. If we
                        would only reduce our forces, they contend, tensions would disappear and the
                        chances for peace would brighten.</p>
                    <p>America's powerful military presence on the world scene, they believe, makes
                        peace abroad improbable and peace at home impossible.</p>
                    <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0107"/>
                    <p>Now we should never underestimate the appeal of the isolationist school of
                        thought. Their slogans are simplistic and powerful: “Charity begins at home.
                        Let's first solve our problems at home and then we can deal with the
                        problems of the world.”</p>
                    <p>This simple formula touches a responsive chord with many an overburdened
                        taxpayer. It would be easy, easy for a President of the United States to buy
                        some popularity by going along with the new isolationists. But I submit to
                        you that it would be disastrous for our Nation and the world.</p>
                    <p>I hold a totally different view of the world, and I come to a different
                        conclusion about the direction America must take.</p>
                    <p>Imagine for a moment, if you will, what would happen to this world if America
                        were to become a dropout in assuming the responsibility for defending peace
                        and freedom in the world. As every world leader knows, and as even the most
                        outspoken critics of America would admit, the rest of the world would live
                        in terror.</p>
                    <p>Because if America were to turn its back on the world, there would be peace
                        that would settle over this planet, but it would be the kind of peace that
                        suffocated freedom in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                    <p>The danger to us has changed, but it has not vanished. We must revitalize our
                        alliances, not abandon them.</p>
                    <p>We must rule out unilateral disarmament, because in the real world it
                        wouldn't work. If we pursue arms control as an end in itself, we will not
                        achieve our end. The adversaries in the world are not in conflict because
                        they are armed. They are armed because they are in conflict, and have not
                        yet learned peaceful ways to resolve their conflicting national
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The aggressors of this world are not going to give the United States a period
                        of grace in which to put our domestic house in order—just as the crises
                        within our society cannot be put on a back burner until we resolve the
                        problem of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The most successful solutions that we can possibly imagine for our domestic
                        programs will be meaningless if we are not around to enjoy them. Nor can we
                        conduct a successful peace policy abroad if our society is at war with
                        itself at home.</p>
                    <p>There is no advancement for Americans at home in a retreat from the problems
                        of the world. I say that America has a vital national interest in world
                        stability, and no other nation can uphold that interest for us.</p>
                    <p>We stand at a crossroad in our history. We shall reaffirm our destiny for
                        greatness or we shall choose instead to withdraw into ourselves. The choice
                        will affect far more than our foreign policy; it will determine the quality
                        of our lives.</p>
                    <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0108"/>
                    <p>A nation needs many qualities, but it needs faith and confidence above all.
                        Skeptics do not build societies; the idealists are the builders. Only
                        societies that believe in themselves can rise to their challenges. Let us
                        not, then, pose a false choice between meeting our responsibilities abroad
                        and meeting the needs of our people at home. We shall meet both or we shall
                        meet neither.</p>
                    <p>That is why my disagreement with the skeptics and the isolationists is
                        fundamental. They have lost the vision indispensable to great leadership.
                        They observe the problems that confront us; they measure our resources and
                        then they despair. When the first vessels set out from Europe for the New
                        World these men would have weighed the risks and they would have stayed
                        behind. When the colonists on the eastern seaboard started across the
                        Appalachians to the unknown reaches of the Ohio Valley, these men would have
                        counted the costs and they would have stayed behind.</p>
                    <p>Our current exploration of space makes the point vividly; here is testimony
                        to man's vision and to man's courage. The journey of the astronauts is more
                        than a technical achievement; it is a reaching-out of the human spirit. It
                        lifts our sights; it demonstrates that magnificent conceptions can be made
                        real.</p>
                    <p>They inspire us and at the same time they teach us true humility. What could
                        bring home to us more the limitations of the human scale than the hauntingly
                        beautiful picture of our earth seen from the moon?</p>
                    <p>When the first man stands on the moon next month every American will stand
                        taller because of what he has done, and we should be proud of this
                        magnificent achievement.</p>
                    <p>We will know then that every man achieves his own greatness by reaching out
                        beyond himself, and so it is with nations. When a nation believes in
                        itself—as Athenians did in their Golden Age, as Italians did in the
                        Renaissance—that nation can perform miracles. Only when a nation means
                        something to itself can it mean something to others.</p>
                    <p>That is why I believe a resurgence of American idealism can bring about a
                        modern miracle, and that modern miracle is a world order of peace and
                        justice.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Gerry:</p>
                    <p>Following our discussion today, I wish to convey to you my thoughts on the
                        forthcoming talks with the Soviet Union on strategic arms. You and your
                        associates will be dealing with a subject of crucial significance to the
                        safety of this country. My purpose in these talks is to determine whether it
                        is feasible to make arrangements with the Soviet Government that will
                        contribute to the preservation and, if possible, the improvement of this
                        country's security. Any arrangement with the Soviet Union, especially if it
                        is to be in the form of explicit and formal commitments, must meet this test
                        to my own full satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>When I speak of this country's security, I fully realize that we cannot
                        expect to return to an era when our country was literally immune to physical
                        threat. Neither our military programs nor any negotiation with our potential
                        adversaries can achieve that. But I am speaking of a situation in which I,
                        as President and Commander-in-Chief, have at my disposal military forces
                        that will provide me with the best assurance attainable in present and
                        foreseeable circumstances that no opponent can rationally expect to derive
                        benefit from attacking, or threatening to attack us or our allies. I am
                        determined, moreover, to pass on to my successor that same sense of
                        assurance.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet leaders operate on similar premises (which we do not know and
                        which their current military programs give some reason to doubt), there
                        could be, I believe, a prospect of reaching an understanding with them
                        whereby, in the first instance, limits would be placed on the quantitative
                        and qualitative growth of strategic forces. It will be your task to obtain
                        evidence that will assist me in making a determination whether such a
                        prospect is real and what the elements of such an understanding could
                        be.</p>
                    <p>Any understanding, whatever the form, that places limitations on Soviet
                        forces will obviously involve limitations on ours. I will judge the
                        resulting relationship of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet strategic
                        forces in terms of the criteria for strategic sufficiency that I have
                        established.</p>
                    <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0110"/>
                    <p>Moreover, I will accept limitations on our forces only after I have assured
                        myself of our ability to detect Soviet failure to implement limitations on
                        their own forces in sufficient time to protect our security interests. In
                        this latter connection, you should know that I am determined to avoid,
                        within the Government and in the country at large, divisive disputes
                        regarding Soviet compliance or non-compliance with an understanding or
                        agreement. Nor will I bequeath to a future President the seeds of such
                        disputes. In our open society and political system it is my duty to provide
                        persuasive public evidence not only of any Soviet non-compliance with an
                        agreement but also of Soviet compliance with it. Any agreed limitations must
                        therefore meet the test of verifiability. I recognize that this may not be
                        obtainable with 100 percent assurance; but the margin of uncertainty must be
                        reasonable. I will make this judgement.</p>
                    <p>I have carefully examined the possible alternative arrangements that might be
                        entered into with the Soviet Union, as developed through our National
                        Security Council process. In the absence of any indications from the Soviet
                        Union of the direction they propose to take, I do not find it possible to
                        make a clear selection among them. I do not, therefore, desire to propose to
                        the Soviet Government a specific set of measures corresponding to the five
                        alternatives analyzed in <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 62.<note

                        that we are prepared to consider limitations on all strategic offensive and
                        defensive weapons systems, that our suggestions are not exhaustive but that
                        we wish to hear their views before advancing any additional ones ourselves.

                    <p>In short, your task in the initial phases of the talks is to explore Soviet
                        intentions without yourself placing on the table the full range of
                        alternative arrangements that we might consider. In the light of the
                        progress of the explorations, and other relevant factors, I will determine
                        the timing and contents of any specific limitation proposal that we might
                        make to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Let me, in conclusion, outline my general approach to our relations with the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> so that you and your associates
                        will be guided thereby in <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0111"/>your talks.
                        I have conveyed to the Soviet leaders my view that our relations should be
                        based on a recognition by each side of the legitimate security interests of
                        the other; I have conveyed to them also my readiness to engage in bona fide
                        negotiations on concrete issues. I have told them that I have no interest
                        either in polemical exchanges or in the mere atmospherics of détente. Having
                        propounded these principles and acted on them in practice since entering
                        office, I believe the seriousness of this Administration in pursuing the
                        path of equitable accommodation with the Soviet Union is being demonstrated.
                        I consider that the approach to the arms limitation talks outlined above
                        will serve to provide further such demonstration. The other side has the
                        opportunity to respond to the same spirit. If it does so, arrangements to
                        restrain the pace of competition in the field of strategic armaments should
                        be within our reach.</p>

                    <p>On July 25, 1969, during a tour of Asia, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met with reporters in Guam. His
                        remarks were on a background basis, for attribution but not direct
                        quotation. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was in Guam after
                        witnessing the splashdown in the Pacific Ocean of the Apollo astronauts
                        following their return from the first landing on the moon. Speaking at 6:30
                        p.m. in the Top O' the Mar Officers Club, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> outlined what was first called the Guam Doctrine and
                        later the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. Looking to
                        the future, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said that Asia
                        “poses, in my view, over the long haul, looking down to the end of the
                        century, the greatest threat to the peace of the world, and, for that
                        reason, the United States should continue to play a significant role.” But
                        he qualified the scope of that role:</p>
                    <p>“Asians will say in every country that we visit that they do not want be
                        dictated to from outside, Asia for Asians. And that is what we want, and
                        that is the role we should play. We should assist but we should not
                        dictate.</p>
                    <p>“At this time the political and economic plans that they are developing are
                        very hopeful. We will give assistance to those plans. We, of course, will
                        keep the treaty commitments that we have.</p>
                    <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0112"/>
                    <p>“But as far as our role is concerned, we must avoid the kind of policy that
                        will make countries in Asia so dependent upon us that we are dragged into
                        conflicts such as the one we have in Vietnam.”</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, the President reiterated that the United States
                        would honor its treaty commitments, but added “that as far as the problems
                        of military defense, except for the threat of a major power involving
                        nuclear weapons, that the United States is going to encourage and has a
                        right to expect that this problem will be handled by, and responsibility for
                        it taken by, the Asian nations themselves.”</p>
                    <p>The full text of the President's remarks was subsequently released and is
                        printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United
                            States: <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>, 1969,</hi>
                        pages 544-556.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s remarks stirred
                        great interest among the press and the public in both Asia and the United
                        States. The doctrine was refined and restated repeatedly and became one of
                        the principal foreign policy themes of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> administration. As to its origins, <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> recalls that in preparing
                        for the Asian trip he and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                        discussed redefining the parameters of U.S. commitments in the region in
                        light of U.S. experience in Vietnam, but he was surprised by <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s informal remarks in Guam. According
                        to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, the original intention
                        was to make a speech along similar lines later in the summer. (<persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, <hi rend="italic">White House
                            Years,</hi> pages 222-225)</p>
                    <p>In his memoirs, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> notes that the
                        doctrine he announced on Guam was misinterpreted by some as signaling a U.S.
                        withdrawal from Asia, as well as other parts of the world. In his view, “the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine was not a formula
                        for getting America out of Asia, but one that provided the only sound basis
                        for America's staying in and continuing to play a responsible role in
                        helping non-communist nations and neutrals as well as our Asian allies to
                        defend their independence.” (<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>,

                    <p>In a background briefing for reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, on July 29,
                        1969, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> amplified on

                            >Nixon</persName> in Guam 4 days earlier (see <ref target="#d29"
                            >Document 29</ref>). In response to a question as to how the Asian
                        nations consulted on the President's tour had responded to the President's
                        remarks in Guam, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said:</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0113"/>
                    <p>“I would prefer to answer how the Asian nations have taken to the President's
                        general position, because the text of the Guam conference isn't available
                        and we haven't presented the Guam conference as such, although of course, we
                        stand fully behind it.</p>
                    <p>“We have had full and detailed conversations with the Asian nations about the
                        general philosophy that the President expressed at Guam and repeated at
                        Manila.</p>
                    <p>“The Asian nations that we have talked to have agreed with us that the future
                        of Asia must be, in the first instance, shaped by Asians and cannot be
                        developed on the basis of prescriptions devised in Washington. They have
                        also agreed with our general philosophy that the United States will, of
                        course, fully live up to all of its commitments in this area, and that it
                        will, of course, remain a Pacific power.</p>
                    <p>“However, it is clear that in the new period, in the period ahead, it becomes
                        important to understand the various dangers that the Asian nations may face.
                        As against military aggression from the outside, the President has repeated
                        at every stop our intention to live up to those commitments that we have
                        made, as well as to those commitments that are implied in the general United
                        Nations Charter and the inherent importance of various countries.</p>
                    <p>“As regards internal subversion, we have stated that the primary
                        responsibility for combating internal subversion has to be borne by the
                        countries concerned with respect to manpower, with American material and
                        technical help where that is indicated and thought appropriate.</p>
                    <p>“I am happy to report to you that this view has been shared by the heads of
                        Government of every country in which we have spoken, and I have been
                        particularly authorized by the heads of Government of Thailand to express to
                        you their complete agreement with our philosophy, that the manpower to fight
                        internal subversion has to be supplied by the countries concerned, with
                        American material and technical help where indicated.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Does that mean that the United States now has decided not to supply any
                        combat troops where a country is faced with internal subversion?</p>
                    <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The general policy is
                        that internal subversion has to be the primary responsibility of the
                        threatened country. In an overwhelming majority of the cases, to which it is
                        hard to think of an exception, the numbers involved are not tremendous. We
                        are talking now of internal subversion.</p>
                    <p>“Q. The numbers of what?</p>
                    <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The numbers of
                        guerrillas involved are not tremendous. Therefore, local manpower should
                        have the predominant responsibility for meeting this.</p>

                    <p>President: Thanks for coming. Time precludes visiting some countries. On the
                        other hand, being in area provides opportunity to hear your countries'
                        reactions to our policies generally—everything from foreign assistance over.
                        What I have tried to get across on trip so far:</p>
                    <p>I have general belief that Asia is where the action is and ought to be—in
                        spite of Vietnam. Other areas naturally important too. <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Soviet <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0115"
                        />relations will be taken care of at highest level. Latin America will not
                        change much. Africa will not govern itself for 200 years. But in terms of
                        conflict involving us, likeliest place is Asia. Mid-East possibly, but there
                        less likely because that would be between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But in Asia, countries on edge of
                        China ripe for export of revolution.</p>
                    <p>As I see it, the way we end Vietnam war will determine whether we can have
                        viable policy in Asia—a settlement that will not be seen as <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> defeat and will not lead to Communist
                        takeover in a few years. Don't have to put this in domino terms.</p>
                    <p>One could conclude that getting out of Vietnam any way would be best thing we
                        could do. But—though everyone wants peace—the most detrimental effect of a
                        Vietnam settlement would be a settlement that produced Communist victory in
                        a few years. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> people would throw up hands
                        on further active Asian involvement. We are going through critical phase for
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> world leadership—American people never
                        wanted to be world leaders in first place and maybe that's why we have never
                        had a world policy.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are reports by Chiefs of Mission Godley, Hummel, Lindquist,
                        Burns, Neumann, Corry, Laise, and Bunker on developments in their respective
                        areas of responsibility.]</p>
                    <p>President: Let me sum up.</p>
                    <p>On Mid-East, no progress of significance. I anticipate none. May only come
                        only at a very high level only when Soviets realize they may be drawn in.
                        Arabs they support in shaky positions. Very pessimistic situation at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>On Vietnam, no significant progress in Paris on public talks—don't talk about
                        private contacts. Soviets have played minimal role; expect none unless they
                        can get something because they can't get caught at it. Escalation that would
                        involve <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> remote. Ties us down. One factor in other direction is
                        that they have their troubles. As long as Vietnam going on, difficult to
                        make progress in other fields with us. If <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> needs or wants better relations with <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, moving on Vietnam would open door. If I were
                        where they sit, I would keep “giving it to the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>” in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Chinese-Soviet and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attitude. I don't think
                        we should rush quickly into embrace with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> to contain China. Best <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        stance is to play each—not publicly. <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-Europe lined up
                        against rest of Asia not a pretty prospect. <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> security pact would
                        invite Soviet adventurism in area; can let people talk about it but not do
                        anything about.</p>
                    <p>What really rides on Vietnam, is whether <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        people are going to play big role in world or not. That question is [in]very
                        serious doubt. Mass of people usually think right but intellectuals oppose
                        all but passive <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0116"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> role. How can we conduct policies in Asia

                        expand the definition of the doctrine established by <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in Guam on July 25:</p>
                    <p>“We came to Asia to put before the countries we visited our general approach
                        to Asian policy, which I perhaps can sum up briefly as follows:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>“One, that we will honor all commitments which we have made; two, that
                            we will not undertake any new formal commitments; three, that the best
                            defense against the insurrection is to prevent it from happening, by
                            removing the conditions that give rise to it. If insurrection reaches
                            the form, or if subversion reaches the form of insurrection, the
                            American role should be confined, essentially, to technical and military
                            assistance and not to the supply of ground forces in those cases in
                            which we feel our interest is sufficiently involved to engage ourselves
                            at all.</item>
                        <item>“Five, that peace in Asia is a pre-condition to peace in the world,
                            and that peace in Asia cannot result primarily from American
                            conceptions, but has to involve Asian initiatives, and a structure
                            developed by Asians.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>“Therefore, we would look favorably upon regional and sub-regional
                        arrangements that have an Asian origin, and we would be prepared to give our
                        support, especially in the economic field, where it is <pb n="97"
                            xml:id="pg_97" facs="0117"/>asked for and where our view of the
                        necessities coincides with that of the countries concerned.</p>
                    <p>“I believe that while when we started out there was a fear in many of the
                        countries that we visited that the United States might withdraw from Asia
                        altogether, or might withdraw too precipitously from Vietnam, that there is
                        an understanding that we are moving into a new phase, that we are looking
                        for more permanent relationships and not the essentially emergency measures
                        that were inevitable in the immediate post-war period.</p>
                    <p>“I believe also that there is a general recognition that the way the war in
                        Vietnam ends will affect the American posture towards international affairs
                        and towards a role in Asia, and I think we have laid the basis for a
                        relationship which, over a longer period of time, will be more viable than
                        the existing one.” (Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, <persName

                        Americans—that Asia cannot move forward if a nation as large as China
                        remains isolated. He further said that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        should not be party to any arrangements designed to isolate China. He asked
                        President Yahya to convey his feeling to the Chinese at the highest

                    <p>When he returned from his trip to Asia and Romania, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> briefed Congressional leaders on
                        August 4, 1969, on the new policy he had outlined in Guam. In the process,
                        he drew the broader implications of the policy:</p>
                    <p>“The centerpiece of the meeting was a monologue by the President on his just
                        completed trip to Southeast Asia, South Asia and Romania. The President
                        began the meeting with a discussion of American policy in Asia. He said that
                        if you gentlemen are somewhat confused by the seeming contradiction between
                        my statements in various Asian countries, this is quite deliberate. American
                        policy in Asia is in a transition stage. We have to realize that these are
                        different countries requiring different approaches; the U.S. must move away
                        from a monolithic approach to a country-by-country approach in the area.
                        However, that approach will work only if we have some general operative
                        principles. The President then reverted to his own background; I came from
                        the ‘era of pacts,’ he said. I supported this approach in the past, but now
                        25 years after World War II, we have to revise our policy to meet the new
                        situation. It is important this be done subtly and gradually.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that his visits with Yahya Khan in Pakistan and <persName
                            corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> in Romania were worth going half
                        way around the world to see. He said their reports were extremely helpful
                        regarding the Sino-Soviet problem, and that we have difficulty getting hard
                        intelligence on this because we simply have no agents in some of those
                        areas. The policy we should begin to follow now, he indicated, is this. <pb
                            n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0119"/>The U.S. must keep the commitments it
                        has made thus far, the treaties it has made, because a failure here would
                        bring drastic repercussions both in terms of what would happen to the people
                        and in terms of American credibility in the area. However, we should not
                        expand any treaty; the time has come to examine our commitments on a country
                        by country basis. In some areas, he said, it is not in our interest to have
                        an agreement. I don't believe we should become involved in some of these
                        areas if we can possibly avoid it. However, he reiterated that he felt that
                        history would vindicate the decisions in Vietnam and that the war there is
                        in the basic interest of peace in the Pacific. The President reaffirmed his
                        conviction that were it not for the U.S. keeping the cork in the bottle in
                        Vietnam, the 115 million people in Indonesia would now be under Communist
                        rule. These then were the basics of the new policy:</p>
                    <p>“To maintain the credibility of America's existing commitments and to make no
                        new commitments in the area. However, if a major power should move across a
                        border openly, this would be a different ball game, but since that would
                        involve a confrontation of some kind with the U.S., the President felt the
                        likelihood of that kind of activity to be small. Our policy in the future,
                        he said, will be to help them fight the war and not fight the war for them.
                        This referred to other non-Communist Asian nations.</p>
                    <p>“In the event that the difficulties in an Asian country arise from an
                        internal threat, these countries will be called upon to handle it entirely
                        on their own. In the event that the aggression within is subsidized from the
                        outside, we will provide them with American assistance in the form of arms
                        and material, but we will not provide the troops. This is the new approach:
                        we will help them in a material way and not a manpower way, he said.” (Notes

                    <p>The President began the meeting by speaking bluntly about the objectives of
                        the Task Force. It would not be like the earlier Task Forces on aid chaired
                        by General Clay and others. This group must come up with a truly new
                        approach to foreign aid or the U.S. aid program will die.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s presentation to the National Security
                        Council was the worst it had had this year. (This is not due to Dr.
                            <persName>Hannah</persName>, who was new at the time and had not yet
                        been able to effect any changes.) The State Department wants to give aid to
                        every country in the world and the result is lots of “Mickey Mouse
                        programs.” The President does not believe in this approach.</p>
                    <p>Foreign aid is not an abject failure, the President continued. There are
                        numerous success stories. In all of them, however, there were additional key
                        factors beyond aid, such as U.S. military expenditures or impressive natural
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> can expect to hear from the State
                        Department that government-to-government aid is best because State likes to
                        use aid to stroke its clients. They believe in aid to socialist countries
                        and enterprises <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0121"/>and are not worried
                        by such events as India's nationalization of the banking system. The
                        President asserted that we need to get away from government-to-government
                        aid and from aiding countries who are headed toward adoption of totalitarian
                        socialist systems. This is not because of ideology.</p>
                    <p>It is because aid simply will not be effective in such environments. The
                        success stories to date have occurred mainly in environments where the
                        private sector played a major role. He had told Mrs.
                            <persName>Gandhi</persName>, for example, that public aid was not
                        expandable—only private investment was.</p>
                    <p>Latin America is a disaster, the President continued. State and <gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> like to provide aid to consumer/social
                        enterprises for purposes such as health and housing. This is wrong. We must
                        help countries help themselves through supporting industries which have
                        multiplier effects throughout the economy. We must help them increase their
                            <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>'s so they can build the needed
                        infrastructure themselves. The way to help poor people is to help increase
                        the size of the pie from which they can get a slice.</p>
                    <p>The President stated that there has been no really new thought in the foreign
                        aid field in twenty years. There are always references to “trade and aid”
                        and increasing private investment but we have added nothing really new.
                        Everybody is caught in the Marshall Plan syndrome, which unfortunately could
                        not work outside Europe and Japan.</p>
                    <p>The President did not pretend to have the answer himself. He did feel,
                        however, that our program was far too fragmented. We do not need to aid
                        every country. For example, some of the former metropoles should bear the
                        responsibility for their ex-colonies. The U.S. should only aid countries
                        where there is a major U.S. interest. We should not attempt to dictate the
                        type of political system maintained in foreign countries, although many of
                        the Task Force members will probably espouse socialist approaches and repeat
                        many of the old tired ideas.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded that Congress will not provide money to do what is
                        needed in the aid field unless we have a new name and a new approach to the
                        program. He stressed the importance of getting an exceptionally able staff
                        for the Task Force and that the group must not be on the defensive about the
                        aid effort.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, at the President's
                        request, added that the whole U.S. approach to aid has been exceedingly
                        defensive because of the lack of a new concept. The bias has been that
                        foreign aid is good and the only job is to sell it. Another problem is that
                        aid has fallen into the hands of economists, which was all right in Europe
                        where the need was essentially technical and the requisite private energy
                        and political structures existed, but which will not work where political
                        structures do not exist as is the case in many <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                            >LDC</gloss>s.</p>

                    <p>There is no necessary progression from economic growth to political
                        stability, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued.
                        In fact, there must be a political structure or else economic growth will
                        not occur. We therefore need an explicit consideration of the link between
                        political and economic frameworks in particular countries.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that Mr.
                            <persName>Peterson</persName> will hear that leftist totalitarian
                        approaches are completely acceptable but that the U.S. should oppose
                        rightist approaches. This is particularly strange because we do not know
                        what democracy means in a less developed country. This is another conceptual
                        problem which must be tackled. He was afraid that his academic colleagues
                        were not very fertile in answering it.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that our effort should appear publicly as aid without
                        strings but that in practice it, of course, could not be. On the issue of
                        bilateral versus multilateral aid, he noted that many foreigners prefer
                        bilateral assistance from the U.S. Indonesia, for example, was uneasy about
                        multilateral aid because they felt it let the Japanese get additional
                        leverage through the use of U.S. money—they feel it is not truly
                        multilateral. The President also noted that Indonesia was very high on his
                        list—the State Department disagreed, but the President thought Indonesia was
                        one country which could make it. The President stressed that Japan and
                        Western Europe must increase their aid efforts, however.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that the U.S. should use its aid for humanitarian
                        purposes in particular circumstances. Furthermore, we should not simply help
                        those who meet our ideas of proper political organization. The key is to
                        help those who follow economic approaches, particularly reliance on the
                        private sector, which we consider feasible in leading to real development.
                        He would not be worried about the politics of the leaders of particular
                        countries but rather about the climate for investment and other major
                        economic approaches.</p>
                    <p>The President further stressed that population control is a must. He urged
                        Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> to read his message to the Congress on
                            population<note n="3" xml:id="d35fn3">For text of the President's July

                        involved in this effort. Population control must go hand in hand with aid.
                        The U.S. has finally bitten the bullet on this issue and made it a top
                        priority national policy.</p>
                    <p>Trade is another key area, and he urged Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> to
                        speak with Ambassador Gilbert,<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4"> Carl J. Gilbert,
                            Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</note> Secretary

                        trade policy. We will probably want to try some new initiatives in this
                        area. Linkage among trade, aid and population control may be the necessary
                        new approach.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0123"/>
                    <p>On military aid, the President warned that many of the panelists will
                        probably oppose it completely. He agrees that we should not supply exotic
                        weapons to countries which do not need them. However, State/<gloss
                            target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is wrong to not want to help Indonesia
                        militarily; they must have sufficient military assistance to maintain
                        internal security. More broadly, the military may be the most stable force
                        in most countries. He would therefore hope that Mr.
                            <persName>Peterson</persName> would have no preconceptions that the
                        military or rightist leaders are villains. Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName>
                        agreed that there is a new breed of military men around the world,
                        especially in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>The President summarized that we should follow an aid approach that will
                        work. Otherwise we should forget it. A banker's approach, especially that of
                        the Bank of America with its record of innovative financing, is good for
                        this problem.</p>
                    <p>In response to Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName>'s question about the thrust
                        of overall U.S. foreign policy, the President said that Congress will not
                        buy any aid program not directly related to U.S. foreign policy objectives,
                        except perhaps for a few clear humanitarian cases. He felt that our long
                        term foreign policy interests will be well served by broad, generous foreign
                        assistance programs. Because of the growing gulf between our wealth and that
                        of most countries, and the shrinking of the world through modern
                        communications, people in the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s will not
                        stand for continuation of the status quo. It will develop like our own urban
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>For the next five years, however, our efforts will be limited by budg-etary
                        restrictions. We must thus bore in where it really counts with what we have.
                        In the longer term, we must think of broader approaches.</p>
                    <p>The President stated his strong conviction that aid won't work unless and
                        until recipient countries develop political stability. He agrees with Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that aid does not
                        necessarily lead to political stability. He would use our limited resources
                        in areas where some stability already exists.</p>
                    <p>We need some success stories. In the Pakistan/India situation, for example,
                        Pakistan comes out way ahead in terms of likely progress, partly because
                        India is headed down the road toward becoming a socialist state. Latin
                        America is an exceptionally difficult case and we will send Mr.
                            <persName>Peterson</persName> a copy of the Rockefeller report when it
                        is received.<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5">At the request of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, New York Governor

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that individual
                        success stories in given regions could spread out through the region by
                        galvanizing others into action. We need to move toward greater self-reliance
                        on the part of other countries. This is the thrust of our overall foreign
                        policy—to get others to shoulder a greater share of the burden.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued that we must
                        get away from abstract notions. Our policy must relate to concrete
                        objectives of mutual interest between the U.S. and other countries. Earlier
                        U.S. aid efforts were relatively easy technical problems. We now have the
                        problem of developing a world order in which the U.S. does not have to carry
                        the entire burden. This means relating individual countries to others in
                        their regions and then relating them to the U.S. We are in for some troubled
                        years ahead, especially in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated that his foreign policy approach is based on
                        pragmatism. The test of a particular policy is how well it will work. We
                        must get away from ideological battles. In response to a question from Mr.
                            <persName>Peterson</persName>, he affirmed that he was not terribly
                        concerned with electoral systems in other countries. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that we must look at their
                        foreign policy as it affects us.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the plethora of small U.S. programs in Africa, the President said
                        he was not impressed by the argument that the Communists will pour in aid if
                        we don't. We need not react every time to such a threat. The question is
                        whether U.S. interests in the particular countries are vital. We must not
                        let other countries shake us down, even though some of our friends are among
                        those who do so.</p>
                    <p>The President reiterated that we should not pour money down ratholes. We
                        should test a specific program by asking whether it will work. The Task
                        Force should look into all the international lending organizations and the
                        trade area, where we must consider preferential arrangements. In general,
                        the Task Force should take a broad view of its mandate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> asked who would be his main point of
                        contact with the Administration. The President replied that Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, or anyone he might designate,
                        would be that point. The Task Force should of course get input from Dr.
                            <persName>Hannah</persName>, who is very able and will be developing
                        some new ideas as he gets new people.</p>
                    <p>The President also noted that we probably have too many Americans abroad, a
                        point on which he probably differs with Dr. <persName>Hannah</persName>.
                        Point IV was great in its time, but the U.S. generally has the wrong people
                        overseas. We should not assume that the best possible world is one in which
                        many Americans are helping out overseas. In fact, the Task Force must assume
                        that our present aid program is not full of good administrators. Many of our
                        people are dedicated but many are <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0125"
                        />incompetent, partly because <gloss target="#t_US1">AID</gloss> is short of
                        money and is a resting place for persons nearing retirement.</p>
                    <p>American businessmen abroad are not so good either, because the best
                        businessmen do not view foreign assignments as the road to success. However,
                        the President suggested that Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> seek the
                        views of a thousand U.S. businessmen overseas on our aid program, perhaps
                        through getting the top 25-30 companies to canvass their people and pass
                        their ideas on to us.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded that Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> faced an
                        extremely difficult job. The effort had been tried before and failed. In
                        addition, many people disagreed with the views that the President had been
                        spelling out. What he did know, however, was that the effort of the past
                        will not sell even if it is right. And Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> added that with the loss of purpose in aid the
                        annual appropriation process had become an end in itself.</p>
                    <p>The President instructed Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> to take both a
                        short-term and a long-term look at the problem. What kind of a world do we
                        want in the future? How much can and will others do?</p>
                    <p>He did not have an answer to these questions. He did know that it was
                        ridiculous to simply compare the percentages of different countries' <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>s which are spent on aid, in view of the
                        burden assumed by the U.S. in the military area. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added that it was also irrelevant
                        to compare percentages when the magnitudes differed so sharply. The
                        President also instructed Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> to look at the
                        personnel and organization of our aid effort.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Peterson</persName> concluded that his effort must be to decide
                        upon a new approach and also recommend how to implement it. The President
                        concurred and stressed that the whole program must be reorganized.</p>

                        his government represent much hope for future power, and because the new
                        government does not offer much of a bridge to neutralist figures who could

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> addressed the United
                        Nations General Assembly on September 18, 1969, and expressed the
                        determination of the United States to remain fully engaged as a world
                        power:</p>
                    <p>“I am well aware that many nations have questions about the world role of the
                        United States in the years ahead—about the nature and extent of our future
                        contribution to the structure of peace.</p>
                    <p>“Let me address those doubts and address them quite candidly before this
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>“In recent years, there has been mounting criticism here in the United States
                        of the scope and the results of our international commitments.</p>
                    <p>“This trend, however, has not been confined to the United States alone. In
                        many countries we find a tendency to withdraw from responsibilities, to
                        leave the world's often frustrating problems to the other fellow and just to
                        hope for the best.</p>
                    <p>“As for the United States, I can state here today without qualification: We
                        have not turned away from the world.</p>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0128"/>
                    <p>“We know that with power goes responsibility.</p>
                    <p>“We are neither boastful of our power, nor apologetic about it. We recognize
                        that it exists, and that, as well as conferring certain advantages, it also
                        imposes upon us certain obligations.</p>
                    <p>“As the world changes, the pattern of those obligations and responsibilities
                        changes.</p>
                    <p>“At the end of World War II, the United States for the first time in history
                        assumed the major responsibility for world peace.</p>
                    <p>“We were left in 1945 as the one nation with sufficient strength to contain
                        the new threats of aggression, and with sufficient wealth to help the
                        injured nations back to their feet.</p>
                    <p>“For much of the world, those first difficult postwar years were a time of
                        dependency.</p>
                    <p>“The next step was toward independence, as new nations were born and old
                        nations revived.</p>
                    <p>“Now we are maturing together into a new pattern of interdependence.</p>
                    <p>“It is against this background that we have been urging other nations to
                        assume a greater share of responsibility for their own security, both
                        individually and together with their neighbors. The great challenge now is
                        to enlist the cooperation of many nations in preserving peace and in
                        enriching life. This cannot be done by American edict, or by the edict of
                        any other nation. It must reflect the concepts and the wishes of the people
                        of those nations themselves.</p>
                    <p>“The history of the postwar period teaches that nationalism can be
                        dangerously disruptive—or powerfully creative.</p>
                    <p>“Our aim is to encourage the creative forms of nationalism; to join as
                        partners where our partnership is appropriate, and where it is wanted, but
                        not to let a U.S. presence substitute for independent national effort or
                        infringe on national dignity and national pride.</p>
                    <p>“It is not my belief that the way to peace is by giving up our friends or
                        letting down our allies. On the contrary our aim is to place America's
                        international commitments on a sustainable, long term basis, to encourage
                        local and regional initiatives, to foster national independence and
                        self-sufficiency, and by so doing to strengthen the total fabric of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>“It would be dishonest, particularly before this sophisticated audience, to
                        pretend that the United States has no national interests of its own, or no
                        special concern for its own interests.</p>
                    <p>“However, our most fundamental national interest is in maintaining that
                        structure of international stability on which peace depends, and which makes
                        orderly progress possible.”</p>

                        Vietnam, the President melded his concern over what he saw as the dangers
                        inherent in an effort to disengage from the war in Southeast Asia with his

                        on the Vietnam thing, that if we lost the war in Vietnam or pulled an
                        elegant bug-out the United States would ‘retreat from the world.’ This <hi

                    </list>
                    <p>Attached is a memorandum written by an acquaintance of mine which provides a
                        rather comprehensive assessment of the United States' position in the world.
                        Although I do not agree with its every last word, it does define the problem
                        we face—the generally deteriorating strategic position of the United States
                        during the past decade.</p>
                    <p>Many analysts have written about the problems faced by the Communists. But I
                        do not believe that the world situation, as viewed from Moscow, provides
                        great cause for Communist pessimism.</p>
                    <p>Andrei Zhdanov's “two-camp” speech in September 1947 referred only to
                        Bulgaria, Poland and Romania as relatively secure Communist states and
                        allies. He saw no real possibility in the Middle East and no hope in Latin
                        America. He considered China to be imperialist. But Zhdanov's pessimistic
                        outlook has not been justified by subsequent events—certainly during the
                        last decade.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>—In the Middle East, Russian influence is spreading and moderate Arab
                            governments are under increasing pressure.</item>
                        <item>—In Latin America, the potential for guerrilla warfare grows, and the
                            outlook for future Nasser-type (if not Communist), anti-American
                            governments improves.</item>
                        <item>—In Europe, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is in a state of
                            malaise, accentuated by our shifting policies over the last 10 years.
                            Europeans are increasingly concerned about isolationist currents within
                            the U.S. (particularly within the liberal community).</item>
                        <item>—In Asia, as you saw on your trip, leaders are concerned about the
                            future U.S. role there.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You inherited this legacy of the past decade. The lesson one can draw from it
                        is not that we can fight this trend on every issue. But foreign policy
                        depends on an accumulation of nuances, and no opponent <pb n="111"
                            xml:id="pg_111" facs="0131"/>of ours can have much reason to believe
                        that we will stick to our position on the issues which divide us. When Hanoi
                        compares our negotiating position on Vietnam now with that of 18 months ago,
                        it must conclude that it can achieve its goals simply by waiting. Moscow
                        must reach the same conclusion.</p>
                    <p>These are dangerous conclusions for an enemy to draw, and I believe that we
                        therefore face the prospect of major confrontations.</p>
                    <p>Hence, my concern about the gravity of the situation, of which I thought I
                        should let you know.</p>

                            <item>It is one of the truisms of our time that because of the
                                sensational development of communications and transportation, the
                                globe has shrunk with distances between formerly far-away countries
                                having been reduced to mere hours of flight time. We all pay
                                continuous lip service to the axiom that the hallmark, today, of
                                relations among States, even among continents, is <hi rend="italic"
                                    >inter</hi>dependence rather than independence. But while every
                                political writer and speaker belabors this point ad nauseum, we
                                actually deal with the Mideast, Latin America, the Atlantic Region,
                                Eastern Europe, NE Asia, and SE Asia as if we were still living in
                                the <gloss target="#t_WW1">WW</gloss>-II era when it was realistic
                                and feasible to speak of a European, an India-Burma-China, a Pacific
                                “Strategic Theater” as essentially separate and autonomous.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In theory, people may understand the phenomenon of interdependence
                                rather well and be quite aware of the fact that the whole globe, by
                                now, has become a single strategic theater. In practice, however,
                                near-unavoidable bureaucratic compartmentalization has led to
                                specialization among experts and decision-makers: Those who are
                                knowledgeable regarding the strategically more and more important
                                Trucial Oman, know little or nothing about Canada, and those who are
                                experts on Berlin have no eyes for, or interest in, the issue of
                                Okinawa. The man who daily struggles with the agonizing problem of
                                Vietnam can hardly be expected to pay special attention to the
                                latest coup in Libya, and the person concerned with <gloss

                                in specific areas are deeply interconnected in fact, how the single
                                stones of the mosaic actually form a clearly recognizable overall

                            <item>It might be helpful to start out with a remarkable, largely
                                unnoticed, passage in Senator Mansfield's Report to the President,
                                on his recent Pacific tour. Having stated that the leaders of the
                                Asian countries visited by him “agree” that the role of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in Asian affairs should shrink, the
                                Senator remarked that there was also “some uneasiness” among those
                                leaders “that the pendulum will swing too far from [<gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss>]<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">All
                                    brackets in the source text.</note> over-involvement to
                                non-involvement.” Mansfield is not a “pessimist,” because—as you may
                                remember—he had on the very eve of the invasion of Czechoslovakia
                                reported to President Johnson that, on the basis of his analysis of
                                the situation in East Europe, he considered a reduction of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in Germany not only
                                appropriate but even desirable. Actually, the Senator's
                                wording—“some uneasiness” in non-Communist Asia about the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> moving toward a stance of
                                non-involvement—constitutes a “diplomatic” understatement which
                                barely hints at, but does not really reflect at all, the
                                overwhelming fear of such countries as S. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,
                                Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore—and even Indonesia, the Philippines
                                and Australia—to have to face potential future aggressors

                                years in Vietnam, so that they might peacefully consolidate their

                            <item>It also deserves to be noted that Gen Romulo—unwaveringly

                                anti-Communist—nevertheless remarked in a public speech, some time
                                ago, when he took over the position of Foreign Minister at Manila,
                                that in view of the impossibility to rely henceforth on <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> protection it would be necessary to
                                “adjust” Philippine Foreign Policy. He remarked, in this connection,
                                that, as of that day, Philippine Foreign Office references to China
                                would no longer be to the “Chinese Mainland” but to the People's
                                Republic of China, the country's official designation adopted by the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName> regime. In an

                                in N.Y. he expressed a wish (see NY Times of <pb n="113"
                                    xml:id="pg_113" facs="0133"/>September 22, 1969) “that the

                                would consider [General] MacArthur's suggestion that borders

                                sealed off with a belt of radioactive materials.” The suggestion of
                                so strong, and innately unpopular, a measure by a SE Asian Foreign
                                Minister does reveal more than mere “uneasiness” in the face of

                                because—by chance, or due to some inherent geopolitical

                                most obviously active area of preoccupation, but also because, for
                                that very reason, it must be these days the center of your own

                                reaching the conclusion that, so far, all the indicators point in

                                this development is well known and more than natural, especially
                                since Seoul is afraid, not entirely without justification, that in
                                the “post-Vietnam” period we might thin out, or even reduce greatly,
                                the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces now stationed in that
                                country. Less well known is the fact that the Japanese
                                themselves—although Tokyo, for obvious reasons, cannot publicly
                                admit it—feel less well protected with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> military strength on Okinawa diminished or newly
                                restricted. It is generally, and somewhat superficially, assumed
                                that this heightened sense of insecurity may have the salutary
                                effect of spurring Japan into making a greater defense effort of its
                                own. But one must ask, whether it would really be in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest, if the Japanese followed
                                this line of thought to its logical conclusion; i.e., to the
                                establishment of a purely Japanese nuclear weapons arsenal.
                                Moreover, the leftist opposition, and pacifism in general, are
                                sufficiently powerful within Japan to create such internal upheaval,
                                if the government were actually to embark on any large-scale
                                rearmament, that there would be a lengthy period of instability and
                                weakness in the country, before it could actually become militarily
                                more self-reliant. In the meantime Japan could hardly fail to seek
                                an accommodation with Red China or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                                power position in North as well as in South East Asia, is bound to
                                have a profound effect on the political and strategic thinking and
                                planning of any Asian country which in the ultimate

                                conflict. No doubt, the present Administration is engaged in a
                                superhuman effort to make the two sides see reason and prevent a
                                “fourth round,” but in view of earlier <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                have to intervene in Israel's favor in any “real emergency.”
                                Actually, the historical record proves otherwise. In 1956, we turned
                                against our French and British allies and our Israeli protégés and
                                impelled the latter to evacuate the Sinai peninsula; while in 1967,
                                when Nasser threatened war with remarkable frankness, we tried in
                                every way to dissuade Tel Aviv from reacting to the Egyptian
                                blockade of the Straits of Tiran by non-peaceful means. Israel then
                                started military action on her own, strictly against our wish and
                                will, and won so quickly and overwhelmingly that our readiness to
                                come to its rescue no longer had to be tested. I do not, as you
                                know, consider it an a priori <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> task
                                and mission to protect Israel, but it so happens that in the eyes of

                                considered our “client,” and conclusions must be drawn, of needs,
                                everywhere (not only in Moscow and Tel Aviv but in other capitals as
                                well) from the fact that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is
                                obviously disinclined to support even its own client, if that would

                                moderate government in the Sudan was overthrown by revolutionary

                                weeks ago, King Idris of Libya was ousted by a group of officers
                                leaning toward the Iraqi type of Baathism, one of the most fanatic
                                and anti-Western forms of Arab radicalism. We seemed grateful that,
                                for the time being, the new rulers declared their willingness to
                                tolerate our base at Wheelus and promised not to nationalize the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other Western oil
                                companies. For King Idris, however, we were either unwilling or
                                unable to do anything. One of the results of the Libyan coup—apart
                                from the fact that roughly one billion $ in annual oil revenues has
                                now passed into the hands of avowed Revolutionaries—is the ominous
                                deterioration of Tunisia's position. Long one of the “most
                                reasonable” and most enlightened among Arab countries, Tunisia,
                                still led by the distinctly pro-Western Bourguiba, suddenly finds
                                herself surrounded by two hostile neighbors: Libya and Algeria.
                                Bourguiba can hardly help feeling that with his moderation he has
                                betted on the wrong horse. Small moderate Lebanon, too—which in 1958
                                was still able to call on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military
                                help—is currently being forced to abandon its traditional policy of
                                neutrality and to tolerate, despite surprisingly courageous
                                counter-efforts by its President Helou, the takeover of its
                                southernmost border areas by Arab Commando groups composed almost
                                exclusively of non-Lebanese. Considering the lack of any physical
                                outside support for Helou, it seems only a question of time, when
                                he, too, will be replaced by regimes of the kind now governing

                                correctly, that no more than a total of about 1,500 men would be
                                involved. Not a single Italian, whom I heard discuss the

                                or center—accepted that explanation. Everybody assumed, as a matter

                            <item>The Canadians, incidentally, encounter the same disbelief
                                throughout Europe, when they adduce economic motives for withdrawing
                                roughly one-half of their small European garrison. Unaware of
                                Trudeau's marked sense of independence, many Europeans actually
                                believe that Canada could not very well take such a measure without
                                the, at least tacit, approval of Washington. This, then, leads to
                                the further conclusion that the entire North American continent is
                                beginning to turn inward and intent on ultimately withdrawing all
                                its forces still stationed on foreign soil.</item>

                        <p>1. You will not expect in this sketch any analysis of the complex issue
                            of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> relations. But one comment deserves to be made in the
                            general context I have chosen: The Soviets are developing some genuine
                            fear of Red China and its intractable leaders. They might, therefore,
                            feel impelled by self-interest to seek a genuine Kremlin/Washington
                            détente, and even make certain concessions to the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> as a conceivable future ally, semi-ally or at least
                            friendly “neutral” in a Soviet-Chinese confrontation. The entire Soviet
                            assessment, however, of the weight and value of the United States as a
                            friend or foe, will depend very largely on their considering <gloss

                            purpose and resolve. The realists in the Kremlin may now be “taking our
                            measure,” and a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> yielding, and
                            reluctant to act on all fronts, will appear less interesting and

                                course, exactly what is at stake. So do you, a historian and a man
                                with a pronounced sense of power realities. The policy on which we
                                seem embarked is very obviously dictated by a conviction that
                                “public opinion” demands it and that, accordingly, the government is
                                essentially helpless to act otherwise. This pessimism about the

                                more terrible than that Vietnam war we have to face now. Lincoln
                                used artillery in the streets of New York against rebellious
                                “copperheads;” about 1100 people were killed in two days as a
                                result. He was considered, however, not only a great man but a great
                                humanitarian, when it turned out, subsequently, that he had been
                                “right.” “The people” are not very just, they forgive the victor,

                        States and the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        used the occasion to put into practice his concept of linkage: <quote

                            <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he did
                                not believe much in personal diplomacy, and he recognized that the
                                Ambassador was a strong defender of the interests of his own
                                country. The President pointed out that if the Soviet Union found it
                                possible to do something in Vietnam, and the Vietnam war ended, the
                                U.S. might do something dramatic to improve Soviet-U.S. relations,
                                indeed something more dramatic than they could now imagine. But
                                until then, real progress would be difficult.</p>
                            <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                                whether this meant that there could be no progress. The President
                                replied that progress was possible, but it would have to be confined
                                essentially to what was attainable in diplomatic channels. He said
                                that he was very happy to have Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> use the channel through
                                Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, and he would
                                be prepared to talk to the Ambassador personally. He reiterated that
                                the war could drag on, in which case the U.S. would find its own way
                                to bring it to an end. There was no sense repeating the proposals of
                                the last six months. However, he said, in the meantime, while the
                                situation continued, we could all keep our tone down and talk
                                correctly to each other. It would help, and would lay the basis for
                                further progress, perhaps later on when conditions were more
                                propitious.</p>
                            <p>“The President said that the whole world wanted us to get together.
                                He too wanted nothing so much as to have his Administration

                    <p>In your meeting with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff on October
                        2 you expressed the view that many basic aspects of international politics
                        have changed during the past two decades, and you suggested that we ought to
                        have an analysis of the implications of these changes for the underlying
                        premises of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>One of the first studies the Staff undertook was a comprehensive review of
                        major trends in international politics. Part of that rather long review was
                        a summary of these trends in the context of the postwar evolution of
                        American foreign policy and the current mood of reassessment. I have
                        attached this document (Tab A).</p>
                    <p>The document is one individual's interpretation of a momentous period in U.S.
                        foreign policy, not a consensus of the Staff. But its overview of current
                        trends is based on all the relevant official studies, documents, and
                        analyses and on systematic discussions within the intelligence community. It
                        indicates the emergence of an increasingly complex and pluralistic
                        international environment and suggests some of the implications of this
                        phenomenon for the basic pattern of U.S. policy, but it does not purport to
                        recommend American responses.</p>

                        <p>In a meeting with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff on
                            October 2 the President suggested that, in view of basic changes in
                            international politics over the last twenty years, it would be useful to
                            have a reassessment of the governing assumptions underlying American
                            foreign policy. The pages that follow may serve this purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0144"/>
                        <p>There are three parts to this analysis. The first two parts assess the
                            current questioning of American foreign policy in the light of basic
                            changes—and some continuities—in the international environment and in
                            America's position in the world. The third section spells out the most
                            important trends in international politics over the next one to five
                            years. In this context it suggests on pages 17-19 ways in which the
                            dominant rationale of U.S. foreign policy during much of the cold war
                            must be modified.</p>
                        <p>This analysis is a personal interpretation, but it is based on a thorough
                            examination of the voluminous answers to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"

                        <p rend="center">I. THE REAPPRAISAL OF CONTAINMENT</p>
                        <p>Americans are questioning major features of the policy that has dominated
                            the U.S. position in the world since the beginning of the cold war.
                            Their questioning arises not only from disaffection with the war in
                            Vietnam but also from a sense that familiar perceptions of the world do
                            not fit a changing reality.</p>
                        <p>American foreign policy throughout most of the years since World War II
                            could be summed up, with only a little exaggeration, as containment—that
                            is, the prevention of communist expansion. Although the implementation
                            of containment changed greatly during this period, the objective
                            dominated American policy.</p>
                        <p>The threat of communist expansion has not disappeared, nor has the U.S.
                            ceased being concerned about it. But the patterns of conflict and
                            alignment, of power and political activity, among nations have changed
                            in so many ways—and the communist world has changed so greatly—that
                            containment no longer adequately describes the organizing concept of
                            American foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>This change has not occurred suddenly. It is the result of a process that
                            is in some respects at least a decade old. But its impact on American
                            policy is sharpened now by a national mood of reappraisal—reappraisal of
                            America's foreign interests and of how it should use its power to
                            support them; reappraisal of familiar assumptions about international
                            realities, of the proper extent of American involvement in the world,
                            and of the relative weight that ought to be given to internal rather
                            than external concerns.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0145"/>
                        <p>This mood of reappraisal has been precipitated by the costs and
                            frustrations of the war in Vietnam, but it goes deeper than the reaction
                            to the war and will outlast the war. In Congress, for example, it
                            extends to a loss of confidence in the wisdom of the Executive Branch to
                            define the requirements of American military security. On the campuses
                            it is manifested in efforts to exclude military training and research.
                            But underlying a broad spectrum of dissatisfaction with American foreign
                            policy is an ill-defined feeling that the United States has become
                            involved in world affairs to an extent that exceeds the imperatives of
                            its vital interests, the efficacy of its power, and its equitable share
                            of the burdens of international order. In short, there is a widespread
                            feeling that the nation is “over-committed” and that the familiar
                            rationale of American involvement—containment, falling dominoes, the
                            Munich analogy—no longer fits the facts as it seemed to fit them in a
                            simpler period of East-West confrontation.</p>
                        <p>At the moment this feeling reflects a mood of doubt and frustration, not
                            a set of hardened convictions. It is “limitationist” rather than
                            “isolationist”. It does not spring from the traditional isolationist
                            disposition to remain aloof from the world or the isolationist premise
                            that the U.S. ought to confine the exercise of its material and
                            economic—and especially its military—power to the protection of the
                            United States alone. The commitments the limitationists are prepared to
                            accept would have struck the so-called neo-isolationists of the late
                            1940's as the product of extravagant interventionism. On the other hand,
                            now that the U.S. has become a global power, the impact of limitationism
                            upon the position of the U.S. in the world could be no less significant
                            than the impact of isolationism before World War II.</p>

                        <p>A brief survey of the recent history of American foreign policy indicates
                            the extent to which both the realities and the American perception of
                            the realities have changed. These changes are the background in terms of
                            which the significance of current international trends for American
                            policy should be assessed.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From the United States standpoint the cold war was at the outset
                            dominated by a military confrontation and a political and ideological
                            contest with the Soviet Union in Europe, although this contest had
                            antecedents in Iran and Greece. This confrontation became the basis for
                            the organization of most of Europe into two military alliances, each
                            under the preponderance of a superpower. It froze the division of
                            Germany and Europe and thereby intensified the contest between the <pb
                                n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0146"/>two superpowers and their
                            allies. At the same time, however, the management of the military
                            balance of Europe by two extra-European superpowers also dampened
                            intra-European power politics in both Eastern and Western
                            Europe—politics which had repeatedly been the source of international
                            turmoil and war—and thereby created a new kind of international
                            order.</p>
                        <p>The bipolar order was stabilized by the consolidation of American
                            deterrence in Europe and by the growth of nuclear inhibitions on both
                            sides. Moreover, in the atmosphere of superpower détente following the
                            Berlin and Cuban missile crises the danger of East-West armed conflict
                            in Europe came to seem negligible, notwithstanding the fact that the
                            Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia rekindled concern about the
                            unpredictability of Soviet military action and about the prospect of
                            East European conflict spilling over into West Germany.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Beginning with the Korean War, the bipolar contest, having become
                            relatively stable in Europe, spread to Asia and then, in various muted
                            and indirect ways, to the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean. In
                            spreading to the so-called Third World, this contest also became more
                            diffuse and complicated. For the restless, mostly unstable and poor new
                            states of the crumbling colonial world were moved by a variety of
                            concerns having little or nothing to do with the cold war between the
                            superpowers. Their dominant concerns, next to the achievement of full
                            independence, were national unity, national status, modernization, and
                            the pursuit of local state rivalries.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, in the mid-1950's it seemed as though the Third World might
                            become the decisive arena of the cold war. Following the Korean War the
                            U.S. sought to extend containment to Asia and the Middle East by means
                            of a network of alliances and declarations intended to bolster
                            deterrence, by economic aid and military assistance agreements intended
                            to foster friendly stable states, and in the 1960's by more pointed
                            appeals to nationalism and neutralism intended to identify the U.S. with
                            the rising aspirations of the “developing” world.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, Soviet and Communist Chinese leaders switched from reviling
                            nonaligned states to embracing them as collaborators against the
                            remnants of imperialism. The Soviet Union launched its own selective
                            program of economic and military assistance to gain influence and,
                            possibly, control in areas of Western vulnerability. When the strategy
                            of peaceful coexistence and appeals to bourgeois nationalism failed to
                            pay satisfactory dividends, the international communist parties
                            endorsed, in 1960, a more militant strategy of supporting “wars of
                            national liberation”.</p>

                        <p>Contrary to the popular view in Western countries, however, Soviet
                            leaders were staunchly opposed to Peking's active pursuit of this course
                            at the risk of involving the Soviet Union in war. They were not averse
                            to supporting subversion where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            could control the subverters at a minimum cost and risk, and they could
                            not refuse assistance to the self-proclaimed socialist state of Castro's
                            Cuba; but they preferred to project their influence by establishing
                            close relations with nationalist, anti-Western regimes.</p>
                        <p>The new regimes in the Third World capitalized upon the extension of the
                            great-power contest to their domain in order to gain personal and
                            national status and acquire material assistance. Colorful national
                            leaders—Nehru, Sukarno, Nasser, Nkrumah—dramatized their role in world
                            politics, exalting nonalignment as a principle of international order
                            and touting the struggle for the moral and intellectual allegiance of
                            the modernizing nations as the essence of international politics.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The emergence of politically independent and active states in the
                            colonial areas has exerted a tremendous impact on international
                            politics, but the Third World has not proved to be a decisive arena of
                            great-power conflict. Nor does it fit any of the simplifying conceptions
                            about the climactic role of the less developed countries, such as the
                            polarization of world politics on a North-South or rich-poor axis or on
                            the basis of a grand ideological competition for the organization of

                            disorganized, and resistant to external control and influence to fit
                            into any such single pattern of international politics. Accentuated
                            subnational—communal, ethnic, and tribal—and inter-state conflicts have
                            proved to be stronger determinants of policy than any common denominator

                            internal unity, national security, and economic solvency. The mystique
                            of nonalignment has been dissipated by growing divisions among
                            Afro-Asian states, the discovery by India and others of a national

                        <p>Finally—as events in Greece, Burma, Malaysia, the Philippines, Guatemala,
                            the Congo, Laos, and Indonesia show—the capacity of local communist
                            parties to subvert or gain control of unstable states by “wars <pb
                                n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0148"/>of national liberation” or any
                            other means has proved to be quite limited. This is true even when such
                            parties are supported by an adjacent communist power, especially if the
                            target states receive external assist-ance. South Vietnam now seems to
                            be an exception, due to a combination of unique circumstances: the
                            sophisticated use of modern military power by North Vietnam, the
                            organizational genius of Ho Chi Minh in developing an extensive Viet
                            Cong infrastructure, and his ability to exploit nationalist sentiment in
                            the war against the French. Cuba is an equally unique case of the leader
                            of a non-communist revolution seeking Soviet assistance by appealing for
                            membership in the communist camp.</p>

                            American forces in Europe as indispensable to their security and showed
                            few signs of being ready to supplant American preponderance with

                            never conceived of them as being much more than means of conveying
                            America's deterrent to the rimlands of Eurasia. America's other
                            alliances and security commitments in Asia have served not only as
                            deterrents against direct aggression and, indirectly, as obstacles to
                            subversion but also (in the cases of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan) as
                            constraints upon the military policies and actions of allies.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has encountered far more serious trouble than the U.S.
                            from the loosening of its alliances. Since 1957 the growing split in the
                            Sino-Soviet alliance has been a galling factor in every major Soviet
                            policy and action throughout the world. In recent years the
                            deterioration of this split into hostility has begun to alter
                            fundamentally the structure of world power by establishing an incipient
                            tripolarity at the center of international politics.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, “contradictions” in the Warsaw Pact threaten the
                            maintenance of political and ideological control over the remaining
                            members of the “socialist commonwealth”. As long as Soviet leaders
                            believe that the security of the Warsaw Treaty Organization depends on
                            the political and ideological conformity of bloc members, they will have
                            to rely heavily on armed control and threat of suppression. They will
                            have to do this while trying to preserve an atmosphere of détente
                            without permitting Western (and especially German) economic, political,
                            and cultural penetration to “subvert” Eastern Europe. And at the same
                            time they will be under steady pressure from their clients to subsidize
                            their inefficient economics. The Soviets would face these dilemmas in
                            their most acute form if liberal and nationalist forces were to threaten
                            secure communist control of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviet Union could accept liberalizing tendencies in Eastern
                            Europe without feeling that its external security or its domestic
                            tranquillity were threatened, it might strengthen the cohesion of its
                            bloc by letting it evolve from an empire into a contractual alliance.
                            But there is no assurance that Soviet leadership, foresight, or
                            tolerance of diversity will be equal to this task. Meanwhile, Soviet
                            burdens of empire are the more burdensome because, simultaneously, the
                            Soviet economy (especially in the agricultural sector) is lagging in the
                            face of rising consumer demands.</p>

                                facs="0150"/>ways. In military power, geographical reach, and the
                            global scope of their interests, the discrepancy between them and the
                            second-rank powers is greater than ever. Both have experienced a
                            momentous expansion of powers and commitments. The United States
                            attained its global position in pursuit of containment and a liberal
                            conception of world order; the Soviet Union, in pursuit of an imperial
                            status keyed to an ideological vision. In pursuit of their different
                            aims both were sucked into the power vacuums of the world by the
                            dynamics of their competition and the desire of others to turn it to
                            their own advantage. Both have experienced concomitant frustrations and
                            constraints—domestic and external—upon their ability to manage the
                            environment within which they must exert their power and protect their
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>Now, having consolidated a limited core of common interests in minimizing
                            the risks of armed conflict stemming from direct confrontation or the
                            actions of other states, they nevertheless remain cautious adversaries
                            on a broad spectrum of issues in an increasing portion of the world. In
                            every important international development the relations of the
                            superpowers are an important and often determining element. The vital
                            interests of the U.S. can be affected far more seriously by the actions
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and vice-versa, than by
                            the actions of any other state. The structure of military power in the
                            world is no less dominated by the superpowers than at the outset of the
                            cold war. The military balance between them is no less consequential for
                            the security or insecurity of others.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, more than twenty years after World War II, despite all the
                            diffusion of political activity, U.S.-Soviet relations continue to
                            dominate the center stage of international politics. But their relations
                            are the product of a substantially different mix of animosity and
                            accommodation than in earlier periods of cold-war confrontation. Neither
                            an unqualified adversary nor a partner in condominium, the Soviet Union
                            seeks an international environment in which it can cope with its allies,
                            its clients, and its internal problems—which implies a reduction of
                            international tension and a stabilization of relations with the United
                            States. But it also continues its efforts to overcome American strategic
                            military superiority; to expand its air, land, and sea capacity for
                            overseas intervention; and to eliminate American influence and enhance
                            its own in areas like the Middle East where the stakes seem worth the
                            costs and risks.</p>
                        <p>Having achieved a position of virtual parity with the U.S. in the
                            capacity to inflict unacceptable nuclear retaliatory damage, the Kremlin
                            is in a position either to consolidate détente through arms limitations
                            with the U.S. or to try to exploit a position of strategic strength it
                            lacked during most of the cold war. Conceivably, it could try both
                            courses of action. But even if a bolder leadership should pursue a more
                            aggressive <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0151"/>foreign policy, the
                            pattern of U.S.-Soviet relations would not return to the relatively
                            simple confrontation that appeared to exist at the height of the cold
                            war.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Changes in the principal pattern of conflict facing the U.S. were already
                            altering American policies and policy concerns in 1965 when the U.S.
                            greatly expanded its direct involvement in the war in Vietnam. A more
                            complicated mixture of containment and détente was already developing in
                            U.S.-Soviet relations. The period of expanding American commitments had
                            ended years before. What the agonies of Vietnam have done is to
                            accelerate and accentuate a revision of some familiar aspects of
                            containment which would probably have changed anyway, although more
                            gradually and moderately.</p>
                        <p>America's assistance to South Vietnam against communist insurgency was
                            initiated as a perfectly consistent application of the policy enunciated
                            in the Truman Doctrine of helping independent governments resist
                            communist incursions. The expansion of America's involvement after 1965
                            did not lead to any different rationale. Nevertheless, the costs and
                            frustrations that followed, and their domestic repercussions, have
                            called that rationale into question. In contrast, the adversities of the
                            Korean War led only to a more intensive application of containment to
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>How far-reaching the current revision of America's policy and role will
                            become depends not only upon the popular sentiment of “no more Vietnams”
                            but on a number of other factors. Not the least of these is the
                            government's and the nation's assessment of the nature of the
                            international environment and especially of the nature of the communist
                            threat to vital American interests.</p>

                            <item>One manifestation of the susceptibility of <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                    >LDC</gloss>'s to external influence has been the immense
                                extension since 1950 of American involvement in the internal and
                                external security of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s in
                                pursuit of containment. Since 1955 this development has been
                                accompanied by growing Soviet influence and involvement, especially
                                in the Middle East. This influence is now spreading from India to
                                other parts of Asia. Soviet influence, however, is due to
                                government-to-government relations (particularly through Soviet
                                military assistance) rather than to the influence of communist
                                parties. Indeed, the resistance of <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                    >LDC</gloss>'s to foreign interference, the strength of

                                revolutionary forces in some parts of the Third World (especially
                                Latin America) have restricted the influence of communist parties;
                                while the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet troubles in maintaining the
                                cohesion of its “commonwealth” in Eastern Europe, and the effect of
                                both of these developments in hastening the fragmentation of
                                international communism have increased the independence of communist

                                insurgency or a victorious insurgent government. Although the

                            communist government even in a small state would be as serious a
                            reversal, in American eyes, in Latin America as in either of these two
                            areas because of our special historical relationship to the Western

                            have to demonstrate its continuing engagement in Asian affairs—but in a

                        <p>In any case, if the U.S. seriously seeks to encourage the emergence of

                                    non-proliferation, the international monetary system, and the

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Although in response to these trends the tasks of American policy have
                            become more diverse and complex, they have not become less demanding.
                            Coping with them still implies an active global foreign policy supported
                            by American power and resources.</p>
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0159"/>
                        <p>Such a policy is not incompatible with a selective reduction of America's
                            scale of effort overseas or with the avoidance of burdensome new
                            commitments. But as the familiar rationale of containment becomes less
                            convincing, domestic opposition to “over-commitment” will tend to
                            constrict the resource base of policy and inhibit the exercise of
                            American power to an extent that may jeopardize a flexible global policy
                            and even the support of existing commitments.</p>
                        <p>The prominent role that U.S. economic, diplomatic, and military power
                            plays in the affairs of dozens of other states—whether it is actively
                            used or not—refutes the frequent observations by contemporary analysts
                            about the “impotence of power”. The impression of growing impotence that
                            both of the superpowers convey, however, does have a real basis in
                            changes that have occurred since the period in which the U.S. was
                            establishing and extending containment: The increased fragmentation of
                            power, the greater diffusion of political activity, and the more
                            complicated patterns of international conflict and alignment that have
                            emerged over the past decade have limited the capacity of the U.S. and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to control the effects of
                            their influence and have revealed the limits of their capacity to
                            control the actions of other governments, except by direct military
                            means. At the same time, the U.S. has discovered the great obstacles to
                            using military power directly to achieve political ends.</p>
                        <p>It is also significant for American policy, however, that the U.S. exerts
                            immense and growing influence in the world through a broad range of
                            international activities conducted by nongovernmental individuals,
                            enterprises, and organizations. While the direct influence of the U.S.
                            Government over its international environment has been restricted in one
                            way or another, the scope and reach of American commercial, technical,
                            and cultural influence has continued to expand.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName>:</p>
                    <p>This is in response to your suggestion that I try to put on paper the
                        thoughts about the President's Viet-Nam speech<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">On
                            November 3 President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> gave a
                            nationally televised speech on Vietnam. The speech came to be known as
                            the “silent majority speech” from <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s appeal for support for his policy from “the
                            great silent majority of Americans.” The full text of the speech is
                            printed in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the
                                United States: <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>,
                                1969,</hi> pp. 901-909.</note> that I touched on in our phone
                        conversation Saturday.</p>
                    <p>In thinking about the opportunity—and the need—for a Presidential restatement
                        of our purposes and plans for Viet-Nam, I keep coming back to the pivotal
                        question: why are we justified in calling for additional sacrifices of
                        American lives and the continuing diversion of American resources for
                        something less than victory but short of defeat?</p>
                    <p>It is not enough, I believe, to point to the goal of self-determination for
                        the people of South Viet-Nam. Only a few of the world's peoples enjoy that
                        privilege, if by it we mean the exercise of free choice through fair and
                        honest elections. Nor is this goal made sufficient by the circumstance that
                        in South Viet-Nam the major danger to its fulfillment is externally
                        supported insurgency: the President himself, in his Southeast Asian tour,
                        made clear that assistance against insurgency, even though externally
                        supported, will not hereafter justify the involvement of U.S. combat
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, an element in the South Vietnamese situation which
                        significantly distinguishes it from other situations in which the exercise
                        of self-determination is threatened by external force. This is that we have
                        made a commitment—a promise—to the people of South Viet-Nam to help them
                        preserve the opportunity to determine their own destiny. Whether or not it
                        was wise in the first instance for us to have undertaken such a commitment
                        is not now in issue: the important fact is that we have undertaken it.</p>
                    <p>So firmly and so frequently has the United States proclaimed this objective
                        that upon our willingness to carry it out depends the credibility of all
                        U.S. commitments. And upon the credibility of U.S. commitments <pb n="141"
                            xml:id="pg_141" facs="0161"/>depends, in turn, the possibility of a
                        relatively stable and peaceful world. Conversely, should our word be
                        rendered doubtful by our abandonment of the people of South Viet-Nam, the
                        risk of instability and war—even of World War III—would be measurably
                        enhanced. Not to be willing to make such additional sacrifices as are
                        essential to the fulfillment of our irreducible minimum objective in South
                        Viet-Nam would thus increase the danger that we will be forced to make much
                        greater sacrifices at some future time.</p>
                    <p>Now all this, of course, has been stated many times by the President, not
                        only in his May 14 speech<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">The text is printed
                            ibid., pp. 369-375.</note> but in all his talks with heads of state, who
                        have strongly endorsed these propositions. And yet they badly need
                        restatement, particularly for the American people. For the real point of
                        Viet-Nam is not Viet-Nam itself but our world-wide role. By the same token,
                        the real core of the criticism of our policies in Viet-Nam is a criticism of
                        that role. The critics discount both the continuing causes of conflict
                        between East and West and the continuing risks to every nation whose primary
                        concern is the preservation of its own independence and integrity. In the
                        case of the generation that has grown up since the events which generated
                        the Cold War, this is understandable enough, but no less misguided on that
                        account.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these considerations, it has occurred to me that the
                        President in his November 3 speech, instead of restating our commitment to
                        South Viet-Nam and then relating it to our wider responsibilities, might
                        begin with a review of these responsibilities, explain their importance to
                        world peace, and then show how abandonment of South Viet-Nam, by eroding
                        confidence in our capacity to fulfill them, would prejudice the prospects of
                        world peace. In so doing, he could also stress the point that the very
                        opportunity for an era of negotiations depends on our adherence to our
                        existing obligations. Unilateral concessions are the antithesis of
                        reciprocal concessions. Negotiations, moreover, are aimed at agreement, and
                        the validity of any agreement is dependent upon confidence between the
                        parties that their mutual undertakings will be honored. The capacity of the
                        United States to honor its present undertakings is thus an earnest of its
                        capacity to honor its future undertakings, including those which contribute
                        to a more enduring peace. Our sacrifices in Viet-Nam can thus be seen as
                        sacrifices for a larger cause.</p>
                    <p>For a television audience, to be sure, a defect of this approach is its
                        abstractness. This is a defect, however, which could be offset by injecting
                        as tangible a feeling as possible for the real situation in Viet-Nam <pb
                            n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0162"/>into the latter part of the
                        address. And since the President does in fact have an extraordinarily
                        comprehensive and integrated grasp of the U.S. role in world affairs, it
                        would, I think, heighten the confidence of his viewers in the rightness of
                        his Viet-Nam policies if he laid bare in a low-keyed but thoughtful way the
                        essence of his thinking on this broader subject. In addition, his doing that
                        would at the same time supply ammunition useful in containing other
                        neo-isolationist pressures to roll back U.S. commitments.</p>
                    <p>Such, at any rate, for whatever they may be worth, are the thoughts I wanted
                        to convey.</p>

                        mentioned a book by Thompson, “1940” which is the story of what really

                        there were never tired decisions, only tired commanders. In terms of
                        history, when we talk about the crusades that H.G. Wells talked about, for
                        example the moon thing, had the effect of bringing to Western Europe not
                        just the discovery in the East but the fact that Western Europe at that time
                        devoted itself to a great cause beyond itself. It changed Western Europe.
                        (The President read passages from H.G. Wells.) The President said nations
                        must have great ideas or they cease to be great. They talked about what
                        happened to England and France and that peoples' greatness <pb n="143"

                        themselves. The question is whether we do what we need to both abroad and in
                        the ghettos. If we just go to the ghettos and let go abroad, apart from the
                        destruction that might come from a war, we might destroy ourselves.
                        Roosevelt talked about it as the white man's burden. Both of these people
                        were searching for that same feeling that people need.</p>

                    <p>For the past 35 years, the United States has steadfastly pursued a policy of
                        freer world trade. As a nation, we have recognized that competition cannot
                        stop at the ocean's edge. We have determined that American trade policies
                        must advance the national interest—which means they must respond to the
                        whole of our interests, and not be a device to favor the narrow
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>This Administration has reviewed that policy and we find that its
                        continuation is in our national interest. At the same time, however, it is
                        clear that the trade problems of the 1970s will differ significantly from
                        those of the past. New developments in the rapidly evolving world economy
                        will require new responses and new initiatives.</p>
                    <p>As we look at the changing patterns of world trade, three factors stand out
                        that require us to continue modernizing our own trade policies: <list>
                            <item>
                                <hi rend="italic">First, world economic interdependence has become a
                                    fact.</hi> Reductions in tariffs and in transportation costs
                                have internationalized the world economy just as satellites and
                                global television have internationalized the world communications
                                network. The growth of multi-national corporations provides a
                                dramatic example of this development.</item>
                            <item>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Second, we must recognize that a number of
                                        foreign countries now compete fully with the United States
                                        in world markets.</hi>
                                </p>
                                <p>We have always welcomed such competition. It promotes the
                                    economic development of the entire world to the mutual benefit
                                    of all, <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0164"/>including our
                                    own consumers. It provides an additional stimulus to our own
                                    industry, agriculture and labor force. At the same time,
                                    however, it requires us to insist on fair competition among all
                                    countries.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Third, the traditional surplus in the U.S.
                                        balance of trade has disappeared.</hi> This is largely due
                                    to our own internal inflation and is one more reason why we must
                                    bring that inflation under control.</p>
                                <p>The disappearance of the surplus has suggested to some that we
                                    should abandon our traditional approach toward freer trade. I
                                    reject this argument not only because I believe in the principle
                                    of freer trade, but also for a very simple and pragmatic reason:
                                    any reduction in our imports produced by U.S. restrictions not
                                    accepted by our trading partners would invite foreign reaction
                                    against our own exports—all quite legally. Reduced imports would
                                    thus be offset by reduced exports, and both sides would lose. In
                                    the longer term, such a policy of trade restriction would add to
                                    domestic inflation and jeopardize our competitiveness in world
                                    markets at the very time when tougher competition throughout the
                                    world requires us to improve our competitive capabilities in
                                    every way possible.</p>
                                <p>In fact, the need to restore our trade surplus heightens the need
                                    for further movement toward freer trade. It requires us to
                                    persuade other nations to lower barriers which deny us fair
                                    access to their markets. An environment of freer trade will
                                    permit the widest possible scope for the genius of American
                                    industry and agriculture to respond to the competitive challenge
                                    of the 1970s.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Fourth, the less developed countries need improved
                                    access to the markets of the industrialized countries if their
                                    economic development is to proceed satisfactorily.</hi> Public
                                aid will never be sufficient to meet their needs, nor should it be.
                                I recently announced that, as one step toward improving their market
                                access, the United States would press in world trade forums for a
                                liberal system of tariff preferences for all developing countries.
                                International discussions are now in progress on the matter and I
                                will not deal with it in the trade bill I am submitting today. At
                                the appropriate time, I will submit legislation to the Congress to
                                seek authorization for the United States to extend preferences and
                                to take any other steps toward improving the market access of the
                                less developed countries which might appear desirable and which
                                would require legislation.</item>

                    <p>[Omitted here are proposals for legislation addressing tariffs and
                        trade.]</p>
                    <p>The trade bill I have submitted today is a necessary beginning. It corrects
                        deficiencies in present policies; it enables us to begin the 1970s with a
                        program geared to the start of that decade.</p>
                    <p>As we look further into the Seventies, it is clear that we must reexamine the
                        entire range of our policies and objectives.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0165"/>
                    <p>We must take into account the far-reaching changes which have occurred in
                        investment abroad and in patterns of world trade. I have already outlined
                        some of the problems which we will face in the 1970s. Many more will
                        develop—and also new opportunities will emerge.</p>
                    <p>Intense international competition, new and growing markets, changes in cost
                        levels, technological developments in both agriculture and industry, and
                        large-scale exports of capital are having profound and continuing effects on
                        international production and trade patterns. We can no longer afford to
                        think of our trade policies in the old, simple terms of liberalism vs.
                        protectionism. Rather, we must learn to treat investment, production,
                        employment and trade as interrelated and interdependent.</p>
                    <p>We need a deeper understanding of the ways in which the major sectors of our
                        economy are actually affected by international trade.</p>
                    <p>We have arrived at a point at which a careful review should also be made of
                        our tariff structure itself—including such traditional aspects as its
                        reliance upon specific duties, the relationships among tariff rates on
                        various products, and adapting our system to conform more closely with that
                        of the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>To help prepare for these many future needs, I will appoint a Commission on
                        World Trade to examine the entire range of our trade and related policies,
                        to analyze the problems we are likely to face in the 1970s, and to prepare
                        recommendations on what we should do about them. It will be empowered to
                        call upon the Tariff Commission and the agencies of the Executive Branch for
                        advice, support and assistance, but its recommendations will be its own.</p>
                    <p>By expanding world markets, our trade policies have speeded the pace of our
                        own economic progress and aided the development of others. As we look to the
                        future, we must seek a continued expansion of world trade, even as we also
                        seek the dismantling of those other barriers—political, social and
                        ideological—that have stood in the way of a freer exchange of people and
                        ideas, as well as of goods and technology.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is an open world. Trade is one of the doors to that open world. Its
                        continued expansion requires that others move with us, and that we achieve
                        reciprocity in fact as well as in spirit.</p>
                    <p>Armed with the recommendations and analyses of the new Commission on World
                        Trade, we will work toward broad new policies for the 1970s that will
                        encourage that reciprocity, and that will lead us, in growing and shared
                        prosperity, toward a world both open and just.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>They are a very mixed group—in social origin, in political outlook, in
                        potential for help or harm. Of the young Moratorium marchers, some were
                        certainly the offspring of the affluent, and therefore their politics are a
                        sharp departure from their parents. Yet many probably have fathers who
                        attended college under the GI Bill in the late '40s. Some of the marchers
                        were likely to be the first generation to reach college. And if Tom Wicker
                        is speaking for himself and his colleagues in claiming that “those are our
                        children” down there in the streets, these are also the offspring of some
                        traditionally Democratic elements.</p>
                    <p>The geographic spread of politically active young people is much broader than
                        the East Coast. A Harvard-Princeton game might find a majority of Bostonians
                        and New Yorkers among the alumni in the stands. But the percentage of
                        mid-Westerners and Westerners among the students would be far, far higher
                        than it was 10 or 15 years ago. To use Pat's comparison, the distinction
                        between the subway to City College (or the freeway to Berkeley) as against
                        walking across Harvard Yard has largely broken down in this age of mass
                        higher education.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Why Do They March?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Their motives are undoubtedly varied. I think a good many of these young
                        people simply don't know who they are—and are trying desperately to find
                        out. In the broader sense, they are casualties of our affluence. Brooded
                        over by too zealous, too psychologically-oriented parents, they have lost
                        confidence in themselves as well as in their elders. Graduated into the
                        impersonal routine of a bureaucratic-technological society, they see
                        conformity as a lonesome life without adventure. In short, they do not find
                        meaning or purpose in those values that guided most of their parents.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0167"/>
                    <p>It is this quality of rootlessness and despair that goes to explain their
                        quest for “instant” experience—from politics to sex. And what better refuge
                        from loneliness than the crowd (“the happening”)—from Woodstock to the
                        Moratorium.</p>
                    <p>Confusion and outrage have taken their toll, of course, of youthful energies
                        in every generation. The group Pat talks about is special in the sheer
                        breadth of its political consciousness and activism. It is drawn, after all,
                        from the largest number of educated young people in history. They have had
                        the leisure for self-pity, and the learning enabling them to focus it in a
                        fashionable critique of the “system”.</p>
                    <p>To the degree that they are politically conscious, many are substantially
                        anti-establishment simply because that is not only the natural bent of
                        youthful alienation, but also because it is a major thrust of contemporary
                        academic literature. Modern American sociology, psychology, political
                        science, etc., have turned a glaring light on the faults in our society. So
                        too is some of our modern literature social criticism. All this is bound to
                        fall on fertile ground—and cover more of it than ever before—in a country
                        that sends 8 million kids to college.</p>
                    <p>The practical results are very mixed. The combination of aimlessness and
                        skepticism of the elders has produced a sense of isolation and even of
                        nihilism.</p>
                    <p>A small minority escapes (as it always has) in mindless radicalism. And the
                        predictable quota of shallow minds and fanatics—the organizers rather than
                        the thinkers—ride the crest of the wave to positions of prominence they
                        could never claim otherwise.</p>
                    <p>There is also the danger that many of these young demonstrators—deriving
                        passion from their personal crises—do not grasp the consequences of their
                        actions. Some (though not all by any means) march for marching's sake with
                        the sheepish conformity they claim to abhor. The heroes of a vocal minority
                        among them (Che, <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>, et al) are
                        romantic images devoid of reality. It is just unthinking emotion that links
                        civil rights and Chinese Communism.</p>
                    <p>Yet I believe that the overwhelming majority of these young people across the
                        country remain remarkably open in terms of their future political
                        affiliation. Many are bright and thoughtful. They are committed to right
                        wrongs as well as to find themselves. They are eager to participate,
                        impatient for tangible progress. It is true that they are wary of every
                        answer—and some are ready to suspect that arguments for gradual (realistic)
                        progress (from peace in Vietnam to desegregation) mask some sinister
                        conspiracy against the goal. But this skepticism can also be the bedrock of
                        a critically intelligent and informed citizenry in the '70s and '80s.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>This frame of reference will probably stay with most of these young people
                        through their first decade as voters. Taken alone as a segment of the voting
                        public, however, they are not significant, and you could build a broad
                        majority however you deal with them.</p>
                    <p>They become formidable by adding to their own votes an enormous outburst of
                        political activism, bound to have an influence on others as well as on their
                        parents. We have ample proof of this in the McCarthy phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>In this sense, Vietnam may be only symptomatic. When that issue is gone,
                        another will take its place. For they are fighting the established position
                        as much as a given problem.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">What Can You Do?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I think that attacking this group head-on is counterproductive. This is not
                        to say that you should be soft on the destructive militants. There is
                        obviously a need here for firm leadership. But when talking about the great
                        majority of these young activists, I believe you should weigh the benefits
                        and costs of taking them on.</p>
                    <p>My concern is that blanket condemnation, while giving no lasting benefit,
                        will drive the young activists to focus their energies against you
                        personally—with the fallout Pat describes in the sympathy of their elders
                        and the influence they have in the broader arena. The best posture is that
                        the Administration be seen to take seriously the perplexed but responsible
                        majority of these young people. The posture would be that they may be wrong
                        on the merits of the argument, but you do not doubt the authenticity and
                        sincerity of their concerns.</p>
                    <p>However, we should remember that these same young people will not forgive us
                        for letting them suffer the consequences of their own actions. To take them
                        seriously is not to add one more indulgence. We need not give in to them to
                        show our concern for their problems.</p>
                    <p>Above all, they need leadership to respect. It is the qualities they miss in
                        their own lives—sureness of purpose, confidence in the future, the courage
                        to stand alone—that they will recognize, whatever the differences on
                        specific issues.</p>
                    <p>Although many do not realize it, you have something basic in common with many
                        of them—a conviction that the machinery of New Deal liberalism has to be
                        fundamentally overhauled. You also share a concern that America play a more
                        balanced and restrained role in the world. You are, in fact, turning over
                        most of the rocks at home and abroad that these kids want to see turned
                        over. You are in addition, their best protection against the forces their
                        impetuosity and extremism bids fair to unleash on the right.</p>

                    <p>With a concerted and sensitive effort to get across the fresh approach of
                        your Administration, you may well gain some converts among those who now
                        seem irretrievable.</p>

                        <p>Last night Teddy White related to me your hopes for reviving the
                                Eisenhower-<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> majority.
                            This seems to me altogether a worthy goal, and a perfectly feasible one.
                            But I fear we may be jeopardizing that outcome by certain present
                            postures which are now in no way central to any of your other goals or
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>The Eisenhower-<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> majority was
                            broadbased. (Ike got 20% of the black vote in 1952 and twice that in
                            1956.) But its bedrock consisted of the business and professional class
                            of the nation. These provided the brains, the money, the elan.</p>
                        <p>Clearly your overall policies are ideal for mobilizing that group once
                            again. Your fixed intention to get us out of that war in Asia; to put
                            the economy back in balance; to restore the authority of public
                            institutions; to achieve social progress with social stability—all these
                            are precisely the goals of that group.</p>
                        <p>I think, however, you could lose much of it—needlessly—if their children
                            begin to take personally your necessary, proper and essentially
                            impersonal opposition to their own effort to make foreign policy in the
                            streets.</p>
                        <p>It must be remembered that to an extraordinary degree the demonstrators

                            demonstrating with his girl friend. She is an Auchincloss. As she put it
                            “Uncle Mac [Bundy] and Uncle Bill [Bundy] made a terrible mistake about
                            Vietnam, and I feel I must help rectify it.”<note n="5" xml:id="d45fn5"

                        <p>They can also be wonderful. Maureen Finch who took part in the Moratorium

                            New York Times uttered the famous remark “But those are our children
                            down there on the street.” It remained for Pete Hamill to comment that
                            “You'd think no cop ever had a mother.” No matter. The kids finished

                            Harvard Corps of Intellectual Snobs.” There cannot have been less than
                            $10 billion bucks of Republican money in the Stadium at the time, and as
                            one man it roared approval, i.e., unity with the undergraduates in the

                    <p>As I have talked and thought about the emerging shape of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> foreign policy, I have become
                        increasingly struck by the extent to which its major elements form an
                        integrated structure. Since I am scheduled to address the Boston World
                        Affairs Council on January 12, I am contemplating trying this analysis out
                        in that speech, but it has occurred to me that I should first bring it to
                        your attention as a possible framework for a Presidential statement—in the
                        State of the Union Message, in his year-end review of foreign policy, or in
                        a major speech.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> foreign policy, as I
                        understand it, is built first of all on a realistic awareness of changes in
                        the world that have taken place over the past decade. For purposes of the
                        role of the United States, the most important of these are: (a) the
                        increasing capacity and determination of individual nations to maintain
                        their own independence and integrity; (b) the subordination of ideologies to
                        these over-riding national objectives; and (c) the recognition that United
                        States economic and military resources, in light of competing domestic
                        demands, are not as unlimited as they may once have seemed.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, however, the President affirms the indispensability of a
                        major U.S. role in preserving a relatively stable world order and promoting
                        a more secure peace.</p>
                    <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0172"/>
                    <p>Out of this assessment of changed circumstances and reaffirmation of U.S.
                        responsibility, the following six propositions emerge: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>While scrupulously maintaining our existing commitments and being
                                wary of assuming new ones, we should at the same time cut away any
                                surplus fat that has accumulated around them. This, as I understand
                                it, is the essence of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> Doctrine enunciated in Guam.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>We should encourage national and regional efforts to achieve
                                economic development and promote mutual security. The United States
                                should be a helpful partner in supporting such efforts but not seek
                                to dominate or control them. This, I take it, is implicit in the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and
                                explicit in our Latin American policy. The same approach could well
                                serve also for other regions, e.g., the western Mediterranean,
                                including the Maghreb.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>Other advanced nations should be encouraged to contribute to the
                                support of such regional efforts. Existing multilateral agencies
                                should be called upon to assist and, in some instances, existing
                                structures (e.g., <gloss target="#t_CIAP1">CIAP</gloss>) should be
                                adapted to the purpose or new ones created.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>Meanwhile, as in the Middle East and Berlin, we should vigorously
                                pursue efforts to reduce the causes of tension and conflict.
                                Understanding that unilateral concessions do not purchase stability
                                but stimulate the opposite, we recognize that only those settlements
                                that are the product of hardheaded give-and-take are likely to last.
                                Herein lies one important aspect of the significance—and the
                                opportunity—of the “era of negotiation.”</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>We should simultaneously seek to diminish the dangers inherent in
                                the by-products of tension, i.e., armaments and force levels since
                                these inflict not only heavy economic burdens but tend in themselves
                                to generate an atmosphere of tension. Here lies the other important
                                aspect of the “era of negotiation,” as evidenced by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> and balanced force
                                reductions.</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>There remains the bitter residue left by past tensions, and this
                                we are systematically seeking to dissipate through deliberate and
                                carefully measured steps toward normalizing relations with countries
                                with which our past relationships have, in varying degrees, been
                                strained. Thus, Bucharest and our signals toward the Chicoms.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Not only do these propositions derive from the changed circumstances and the
                        reaffirmed U.S. responsibility noted above, but they are mutually
                        reinforcing. The sharper definition of our existing obligations, for
                        example, and our wariness toward the assumption of new ones rest upon our
                        awareness of the limitations of our resources. To the extent, however, that
                        we succeed in encouraging national and regional self-sufficiency, the need
                        for reliance on us correspondingly diminishes—and so on.</p>

                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am ready for your
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>Q. I thought you might have a frame, if I asked this question: Would you list
                        briefly the accomplishments of the Administration this year and its major
                        disappointments?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me first list the
                        disappointments: Of course we haven't made more progress in ending the war,
                        although we are on course. But we have always said there are two ways of
                        ending the war. One is through essentially unilateral moves, on which we are
                        now embarked, and the other one is through negotiations, which would be the
                        rapid way of ending the war.</p>
                    <p>We are disappointed that there hasn't been more progress in the negotiations
                        and we were perhaps more hopeful that there would be greater progress in the
                        negotiations than there has in fact been, earlier this year.</p>
                    <p>In the accomplishments, let me take a few minutes on that. First, we have
                        devised a new way of making decisions in the field of foreign policy, which
                        I have explained to you on many occasions, and which takes a period of time
                        to become effective; that is, we now have a reasonable opportunity to be
                        sure that when a decision is made, we have looked at every respectable
                        option, not only those generated within the bureaucracy, <pb n="154"
                            xml:id="pg_154" facs="0174"/>but those that exist outside, through the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> system, and we have engaged in a
                        systematic review of American foreign policy with this in mind.</p>
                    <p>We have done so, moreover, because we are convinced that, while Vietnam is,
                        of course, the most anguishing problem we face, and the one that in the
                        short term is going to determine the success or failure of this
                        Administration, in the long term we are in a period in which American
                        foreign policy has to be put on a new foundation.</p>
                    <p>For about 20 years after the end of the war, American foreign policy was
                        conducted with the maxims and the inspiration that guided the Marshall Plan,
                        that is, the notion of a predominant United States, as the only stable
                        country, the richest country, the country without whose leadership and
                        physical contribution nothing was possible, and which had to make all the
                        difference for defense and progress everywhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>Now whichever Administration had come into office would have had to face the
                        fact, I believe, that we have run out of that particular vision. Conditions
                        have changed enormously. We are now in a world in which other parties are
                        playing a greater role. They have regained some of their self-confidence.
                        New nations have come into being. Communism is no longer monolithic and we,
                        therefore, face the problem of helping to build international relations on a
                        basis which may be less unilaterally American.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, we have engaged in a rather systematic review of a whole
                        range of things. What we have done in various fields, really, ought to be
                        seen as part of this general pattern.</p>
                    <p>You take the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine for Asia,
                        the basic philosophy of which has really guided our actions elsewhere. This
                        is based on the proposition, not that the United States withdraws from Asia,
                        but that the defense and progress in Asia, as elsewhere, cannot be a
                        primarily American policy, that the United States can participate where it
                        can make a difference, but it cannot, over an historic period, be the
                        American role to make all the plans, to design all the programs, to execute
                        or implement all the decisions and undertake all the defense and be in the
                        posture where both progress and defense of other areas seem more important
                        to the United States than it is for the countries concerned.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, what President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        announced in Guam is the basic policy we have followed elsewhere. We have
                        generally approached these problems in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> in two bites: That is, we would make a general—the word
                        isn't a bit philosophical—decision first, of where is it we want to go, and
                        then we would make a number of practical decisions on how to implement
                        it.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0175"/>
                    <p>For example, on Latin American policy, we made the general decision of where
                        we wanted to go in July, and then in October, after Governor Rockefeller
                        came back from his trip, and the Department of State and other agencies had
                        made specific recommendations, we developed the implementing decisions.</p>
                    <p>What we have done in Latin America reflects essentially the same philosophy
                        that has guided the policy towards Asia. That is to say, we have tried to
                        develop a pattern that to the greatest degree possible elicits Latin
                        American initiatives and the Latin American contribution, so that the
                        programs that emerge there are joint programs, or programs in which the
                        Latin American countries have played an important and perhaps even
                        predominant role in formulating.</p>
                    <p>We have seen our role in eliciting their initiative and their contribution,
                        and within the framework of what is a fact of life—that huge sums are not
                        available—we have tried to go as far as it is possible to go, through
                        executive and legislative action, to elicit this set of initiatives.</p>
                    <p>The policy towards Okinawa or towards Japan was set in effect in March. We
                        decided in March that we were going to return Okinawa to Japan and we did so
                        because we had to weigh the benefit in terms of physical security in
                        maintaining our base in Okinawa against the intangible benefit of being able
                        to establish a partnership with Japan on major areas of concern in the
                        Pacific.</p>
                    <p>We decided that the temporary continuation of a certain amount of physical
                        security was not our primary problem, that our primary problem was to enlist
                        Japan's cooperation in the development of Asia and in the security interests
                        of its immediate concern; and therefore, it seemed to us important for the
                        sake of this long-term relationship to make the decisions which we did in
                        March.</p>
                    <p>Another major area where we have started is the relationship with the
                        Communist world. We have taken the view that the tensions that have
                        persisted for 25 years have not been caused by an accident and cannot be
                        removed by primarily psychological means.</p>
                    <p>We have made it very clear that we are prepared to negotiate intensively,
                        seriously and concretely, and unemotionally, on a whole range of issues,
                        including <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, which I will come back to
                        in a minute.</p>
                    <p>We have always made it clear that we have no permanent enemies and that we
                        will judge other countries, including Communist countries, and specifically
                        countries like Communist China, on the basis of their actions and not on the
                        basis of their domestic ideology.</p>
                    <p>And we hope we have started a process towards Communist China, that over a
                        period of years, will permit a more calibrated relationship to develop, and
                        one in which such a large part of humanity will not be excluded from the
                        international community.</p>
                    <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0176"/>
                    <p>Now, let me go back to <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> because I think
                        this is a good example of both our approach and our philosophy. There has
                        been a lot of discussion, some discussion in the press, that the White House
                        in contrast to previous periods is not as interested in negotiations as
                        before, that we have not given the push to arms control that previous White
                        Houses have given. I think it might perhaps be of some use, if I explained
                        our general approach, because I think it is symptomatic of the
                        Administration.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks, we are
                            concerned not with one weapons system, but a complex inter-relationship
                            of weapons systems, in which on both sides, the most basic elements of
                            security are involved, and which on our side, the most fundamental
                            issues of alliances and the conception by our allies of their security
                            is involved.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, there are many people who like to see this as a morality
                            play in which the good guys defeat the bad guys and in which you drive
                            desperately or, if not desperately, in which you drive brutally, if
                            necessary, towards one position which you impose on the bad guys with
                            White House leverage, if necessary.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>But if you look at the negotiations in this field that have taken place over
                        the years, you will find that negotiations as relatively simple as the test
                        ban, and as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, took five and three years
                        respectively; that, if you look at what the classical pattern has been, that
                        we would enter with a position.</p>
                    <p>It never happened that the other side would come in with a similar position
                        and therefore, we were confronted with having to spend half of our time
                        negotiating with ourselves, another quarter of our time negotiating with our
                        allies and the rest of our time in an entirely tactical exercise with the
                        Soviets. Therefore, what we attempted to do is to be prepared for the
                        contingency that the other side might really be serious, and that if it was
                        serious, it would have to address a number of fundamental questions, which
                        would concern us as much as them, and, therefore, we did something, which
                        has not been done, I think—I know—in the history of these arms control
                        negotiations; that is, we made a systematic survey of every weapons system
                        that could conceivably be the subject of negotiations, of our intelligence
                        capabilities with respect to that weapons system, of the possibility of
                        evasion with respect to that system, what counter measures we would have to
                        take, if there were evasion, what risks we were running and how we could
                        avoid these risks.</p>
                    <p>And the purpose was to avoid the sterile, theological debate where one group
                        of the bureaucracy would say, “You are jeopardizing American security”
                        without ever being able to define how, and the other group of the
                        bureaucracy would be saying, “You must be able to <pb n="157"
                            xml:id="pg_157" facs="0177"/>run the risk for peace”, without ever being
                        able to tell you what the risk was.</p>
                    <p>As a result, first of all, many of the disagreements, most of the
                        disagreements disappeared because when you define just what the evasion was
                        that was possible, and what the risk was, it was possible to express it in a
                        way in which most people agreed.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we are in a position to put together almost any position, and we
                        have in fact put together a whole variety of positions, depending on the
                        scope of the agreement, that the other side might be prepared to
                        undertake.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, we were able to engage with the Soviets in the preliminary talks in
                        Helsinki, in what I consider the most constructive talks on arms control of
                        which I am familiar, either in or outside the government, and I had
                        participated in almost all of the scientific exchanges outside the
                        government that have taken place.</p>
                    <p>We were told before we went to Helsinki by many people that if we didn't go
                        there with a position, the Soviets would lose confidence in us, or we were
                        told if we didn't go there with a detailed position the Soviets would
                        pre-empt the field with a spectacular of their own.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the curious thing seems to have happened that the Soviet
                        preparations have taken about the same form as ours; that is, they have made
                        a detailed analysis of the problems and I consider that one of the more
                        hopeful signs, regardless of what may come out in the next phase of the
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>We are now in a position to enter the next phase of the talks with some
                        understanding of how the Soviets conceive the problem. And we are not flying
                        blind and we are not just negotiating with ourselves when we put forward a
                        position. Again, I repeat, I think we have done, in terms of preparation,
                        more thorough, detailed, and thoughtful work than I remember having been
                        done in the last ten years.</p>
                    <p>Another example of how this works is in the field of biological and chemical
                        warfare, where rather than turn it into an obtuse exercise of whether one
                        was for or against biological warfare, we went through an analysis of what
                        could be accomplished in either of these forms.</p>
                    <p>And in short, what we have attempted to do is to be thoughtful and to look
                        ahead and to look at matters in a comprehensive manner.</p>
                    <p>The Defense budget now is no longer looked at from a purely security point of
                        view. We have this Defense Policy Review Committee, which has been written
                        about, which takes into consideration political and arms controls
                        considerations and in the consideration of our basic defense posture, we for
                        the first time consider the relationship between the Defense spending and
                        domestic needs.</p>
                    <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0178"/>
                    <p>And when it was presented to the President, he was in a position to compare
                        what domestic priorities had to be given up, or where possible, at various
                        levels of Defense spending.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to be misleading. No procedure and no attempt to be thoughtful
                        guarantees that one is in fact right, or indeed that one is in fact
                        thoughtful. And three years from now, we won't be judged by the process by
                        which we have made the decisions, or even where we attempted to be
                        thoughtful, but whether we were in fact thoughtful. [Omitted here is the
                        question-and-answer session on a variety of foreign policy issues.]</p>

                                differences may be.</item>

                    <p>I suggest that you build first upon these two broad themes and then elaborate
                        by relating other policy developments to the relevant portions of your
                        Inaugural Address.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">See <ref target="#d9">Document

                        <hi rend="italic">Broader Sharing of Responsibility</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The stress should be on the importance of a broader sharing of responsibility
                        as a basis for a sound long-term international collaboration. Five main
                        specific elements could be developed—(1) Vietnamization, (2) Latin American
                        policy, (3) Asian policy (including Okinawa), (4) European policy, and (5)
                        South East Asia other than Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>One aspect of this basic policy thrust was at the core of your address to the
                        Inter-American Press Association on October 31, 1969,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d48fn4">For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                                Presidents of the United States: <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                                    Nixon</persName>, 1969,</hi> pp. 893-901.</note> when you
                        expressed the belief that the “future pattern of American assistance must be
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for Latin American
                        initiatives” and when you offered them a larger role in decisions on
                        economic aid. The efforts we have made to consult more widely with our
                        European allies on matters of concern to them is another. The same policy
                        was set forth in a security context in Guam on July 25,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d48fn5">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> when
                        you said that the United States was going to encourage and had a right to
                        expect that problems of internal security and national defense will be
                        increasingly handled by the Asian nations themselves.</p>
                    <p>The Vietnamization policy is another expression of the same view, and the
                        present success of the Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam in improving
                        the capabilities of its armed forces and assuming a larger share of the
                        fighting on the ground is proof that the policy is based on a realistic
                        appraisal of the potential of South Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>In setting forth this policy the presentation should make it clear that we
                        intend to continue to do our share. Our policy reflects no desire to retreat
                        to a fortress America.<note n="6" xml:id="d48fn6">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> underlined the second half
                            of the first sentence and all of the second sentence. He wrote in the
                            margin: “Hit this <hi rend="italic">very hard</hi>.”</note> Indeed it is
                        an affirmation of our intention to establish a durable basis for continued
                        world-wide cooperation. We have reaffirmed our treaty commitments to <gloss

                            facs="0180"/>allies, and to the attainment of a just peace in Viet-Nam.
                        We have made clear that we will be, as you said in your Inaugural Address,
                        “as strong as we need be for as long as we need be”. We have made clear that
                        we will judge each situation in itself and that we are prepared to assist
                        those who are assisting themselves.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Era of Negotiation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The basis of the policy of negotiations and improved relationship was
                        contained in the Inaugural Address in the words: “after a period of
                        confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation”. The section should
                        bring out that during 1969 the United States sought to bring many major
                        problems that confront the world community to the bargaining table. It
                        should emphasize (1) efforts to negotiate in Viet-Nam, (2) negotiations with
                        the Soviet Union, especially on disarmament, (3) efforts to open talks with
                        the Chinese Communists, (4) efforts to bring about negotiations on the
                        Middle East, and (5) a negotiable stance on matters affecting us, such as in
                        Peru and in Korea.</p>
                    <p>Your Inaugural Address keynoted other important themes which have been
                        carried forward in the policy decisions of this Administration over the past
                        year.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Disarmament</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—You said then “let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms”. This section
                        obviously would deal with the beginning of Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
                        with the Soviet Union. It would also cover the seabeds, <gloss
                            target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, chemical warfare, balanced force
                        reductions and arms limitations in the Middle East. It should bring out that
                        the start of negotiations does not signal their success and that we must
                        govern our defense policies accordingly.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Openness</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>—You said then that “during this Administration our lines of communication
                        will be open” and that this “government will listen”. This willingness to
                        listen and to appreciate the position of others made a major contribution to
                        the style and quality of our relationships with other nations. Our
                        willingness to truly consult, to listen as well as to speak, has improved
                        relations within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. It led
                        to a marked improvement of our relations with France. It is a major aspect
                        of the Latin American policy. It was reflected in your trips to Europe and
                        to Asia and in my Asian trip and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        consultations as well as in your many meetings with foreign officials in
                        Washington. We welcome in the same vein renewal of relations with Cambodia
                        and Mauritania.</p>

                        Here there are many elements to bring out, such as the visits of Doctor
                        DuBridge and AEC Chairman Seaborg to Romania, which could mark a new success
                        in East-West cooperation in the scientific and technological fields; your

                        in which we have conducted our foreign policy is worthy of note. We have
                        tried, in the words of your Inaugural Address, <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                            facs="0182"/>to “lower our voices”. We have curtailed American presence
                        overseas, reducing by 8,000 the number of people employed by the United
                        States abroad because we knew that our presence can be overbearing, and that
                        it is not the size of the American presence that determines our influence
                        but the soundness of our efforts. You have called for a new partnership in
                        Latin America “in which the United States lectures less and listens more”.
                        We have taken a businesslike approach in the various negotiations we have
                        entered. We have reduced the rhetoric and hyperbole in our speeches.</p>

                        likely that the United States will again find itself in the position it held
                        after World War II of being the single country in the Free World with the
                        national will and resources to make a major impact on world events. National
                        capacity and strength will continue to grow among the nations of the world.
                        We have not sought to impede or deflect this trend. Instead we have made
                        clear by word and deed that we will continue to cooperate with and to
                        encourage the increasingly self-reliant members of the world community in

                        comments as relayed by <persName>Dick Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In connection with these drafts I want to remind you that both in Africa and
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> our policy is essentially
                        defensive. Neither is central in any way to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> foreign policy operations or interests. We deal with them
                        because they are there, not because we hope to get great things out of our
                        participation. We aim at minimizing the attention and resources which must
                        be addressed to them. What we really want from both is no trouble. Our
                        policy is therefore directed at damage limiting, rather than at
                        accomplishing anything in particular.</p>
                    <p>That being true, there is (or at least, I can find) no broad and positive
                        conceptual base which can credibly be put forward to explain why we do what
                        we do in Africa and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The real base we
                        cannot mention. The task then is to put the best possible face upon
                        essentially negative roles, and to try to make them sound more positive and
                        more integrated than they actually are.</p>
                    <p>I call this to your attention so that you will be under no illusions that I
                        consider the attached drafts to be what you asked for.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> telephoned President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> on January 14, 1970, to
                        report on negotiations with the North Vietnamese in Paris. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> called the President in Camp
                        David, Maryland, from his office in the <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164"
                            facs="0184"/>White House. (National Archives, <persName

                        and Archives, Daily Diary) During the course of the conversation, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> concluded that the experience of history
                        highlighted the serious risks involved in negotiating with the Soviet Union.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> apparently applied the
                        lesson to negotiations with North Vietnam. His opening and concluding
                        comments relate to negotiations with North Vietnam:</p>
                    <p>“P: I suppose they will want to take the line they will say what have you got
                        to say. I was reading a couple of nights ago the whole record of Churchill's
                        account on Teheran, Malta and his negotiations with Harriman and what
                        happened in terms of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, etc. And really it
                        is a shameful record. It is an outrage. I thought Eisenhower was taking the
                        orders from the top but the whole emphasis was on getting along with the
                        Russians whereas Churchill was concerned with re-drawing the map of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>“K: He was thinking of what would happen after the war.</p>
                    <p>“P: Right. And the whole thing was the absolute hardness of Stalin during the
                        whole thing. The Russians did not give anything on anything.</p>
                    <p>“K: The Russians got us so focused on victory they never talked about
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>“P: You know that in the days of McCarthy and Jenner they really overstated
                        it but basically they happened to be right. We did screw up the peace.</p>
                    <p>“K: For example, the invasion of Southern France. If those units had been put
                        into the Balkans the whole thing would have been different.</p>
                    <p>“P: I think you should scan through it and see just what happened. He would
                        send a message over and obviously the American President was responding and
                        was responding in an almost unbelievably naive way.</p>
                    <p>“K: And these Kremlinologists were saying just what Thompson told you. ‘You
                        have to be in good faith.’</p>
                    <p>“P: Right and Truman turned down a meeting with Churchill first and then came
                        back with the proposition that Truman ought to meet with Stalin first. Well
                        that would have been the most terrible thing. It is well to read this stuff
                        in order to know what we are dealing with now.</p>
                    <p>“K: Hopkins wanted Truman and Roosevelt to be the intermediary between
                        England and Russia, grossly overestimating the British strength and grossly
                        underestimating the Russian intentions.</p>
                    <p>“P: What I am getting at is that I don't know what these clowns want to talk
                        about but the line we take is either they talk or we are going <pb n="165"
                            xml:id="pg_165" facs="0185"/>to sit it out. I don't feel this is any
                        time for concession. And mainly because I feel that the only way we are
                        going to get anywhere is by talking this way.”</p>
                    <p>Later in the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        outlined those elements of his administration's foreign policy he wanted to
                        emphasize in his forthcoming State of the Union address:</p>
                    <p>“P: We have to say a little about Vietnam—maybe pick up what we said Nov 3rd
                        and say it a little differently. We are for a just peace. We have seen
                        progress in Asia, in Japan. We have seen progress here. There are other
                        areas in the world where there are still problems. The Mid-East is still
                        difficult. I will cover it all. We are not going to retreat from our world
                        commitments. We are going to keep them. I would use it to make another whack
                        at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is not a retreat from our
                        world responsibilities. It is a method—a new way. Whether it is Latin
                        America or any other area in the world. If you don't mention everybody they
                        will feel hurt. My point is that we feel that it is time for the industrial
                        nations of the world—all the nations of the world. You might give it a
                        historical slant. As we enter the '70's more than 25 years have passed since
                            <gloss target="#t_WW1">WW</gloss> II—we made a new policy to deal with
                        the new situation. For 25 years the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had to
                        assume the major responsibility. We are for negotiation rather than for
                        confrontation.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation; Library of Congress,

                    <p>In this first year the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        administration has put its own stamp on United States foreign policy. It is
                        a mix of continuity and change.</p>
                    <p>There is a necessity for continuity in our foreign policy which derives from
                        the fact that we are the world's greatest power. Nothing <pb n="166"
                            xml:id="pg_166" facs="0186"/>can relieve us of the inescapable
                        responsibilities that go with that status. Certainly one of the most
                        stabilizing influences in world affairs today is that other nations,
                        friendly and not so friendly, take it for granted that the United States
                        will live up to its obligations. Without the element of continuity in basic
                        United States foreign policy, world affairs would be much more unstable and
                        dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Yet there must be change, too, because world events require a dynamic foreign
                        policy. When this administration took office, our participation in the war
                        in Viet-Nam had come to pervade and color the whole of our foreign policy.
                        In fact, it consumed much of the time and energy of our top leaders. The
                        alternatives seemed to be either to negotiate a settlement or to go on
                        fighting indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>It was clear that we needed another approach. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> decided that our policy should be to
                        negotiate a settlement or, if that were not possible, to transfer the
                        responsibility for combat activities to the South Vietnamese in a way which
                        would assist them to achieve self-determination. As you know, that has come
                        to be known as Vietnamization, and we are cautiously optimistic about its
                        success. It will be carried out until all combat forces and ultimately other
                        forces have been withdrawn or until Hanoi decides to work out a peace
                        through negotiation which will give the people of South Viet-Nam the right
                        of free choice.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s program to end
                        American participation in combat in Viet-Nam is irreversible. We are
                        training and equipping the forces of the Republic of Viet-Nam to take care
                        of themselves as we transfer to them the whole of the combat role. There is
                        a growing confidence in South Viet-Nam that this can be done. Assuming its
                        success—and our policy makes this assumption—the result will be valuable for
                        the future security of the area: a feeling of independence and self-reliance
                        not just in South Viet-Nam but in Southeast Asia as a whole.</p>
                    <p>We believe we are on the right track toward national release from total
                        preoccupation with this one area of foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>If United States foreign policy a year ago was overly concentrated on
                        Viet-Nam, the foreign policy of the Soviet Union was equally preoccupied
                        with the quarrel with Communist China. As far as we can see this is still
                        the case, and there is no reason to believe that it is likely to change
                        dramatically in the near future.</p>
                    <p>It therefore seemed wise to us to make known what our position was with
                        respect to the Sino-Soviet border dispute and the general tensions between
                        those governments. This we have done.</p>
                    <p>We have made it clear that we have no intention of attempting to exploit
                        their differences.</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0187"/>
                    <p>We intend to negotiate with the Soviet Union, hopefully in a meaningful way,
                        in pursuit of common ground and mutual advantage.</p>
                    <p>We also intend to seek ways to have better relations with Communist China.
                        Consequently, we are pleased that we now have an agreement to meet in Warsaw
                        on January 20.</p>
                    <p>To have better relations with the Soviet Union and with Communist China, we
                        believe, would be in our national interest, and our policy is to seek
                        sensible ways to accomplish this. The fact that a Sino-Soviet conflict
                        exists is strictly their affair, but it should not be a restraint on our
                        efforts to improve relations with both.</p>
                    <p>I think I should mention two other powerful nations in the world which are
                        making new contributions to the dynamics of world affairs.</p>
                    <p>The first is Japan. Japan has become the third industrial power of the world.
                        She is ready to play a part in the affairs of the Asian and Pacific
                        community of nations more commensurate with that status. In recognition of
                        this fact our administration decided to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972.
                        This historic decision should be looked upon as the closing act of the
                        postwar period of United States-Japanese relations. Our relations with Japan
                        now enter a new stage of close and friendly cooperation at the beginning of
                        a new decade.</p>
                    <p>The Pacific community provides a bright picture. The highest rates of
                        sustained economic growth in the world are found today in Japan, Korea,
                        Taiwan, and Thailand. The picture in Indonesia is most encouraging.
                        Cooperative regional organizations in the Pacific area have come into being;
                        and as I have indicated, the new strength and energy of Japan is an
                        outstanding factor in that regional picture.</p>
                    <p>The fourth most productive economy in the world is the Federal Republic of
                        Germany. There is a new government in Bonn with which we have excellent
                        relations, both bilaterally and within <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The German Government is seeking in every practical way to reduce tensions
                        that made the German question the most dangerous of the cold-war issues. The
                        North Atlantic Council serves as a good forum for close consultation on
                        policies and methods of improving relationships with the countries of
                        Eastern Europe. But if East-West relations are to return to a more normal
                        state, Germany obviously must play a major role in that process. The present
                        German Government is engaged in an effort to do this in consultation with,
                        and with the support of, its allies, including, of course, the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>These brief remarks serve to highlight the fact that in this next decade

                    </p>
                    <p>On the negotiating front, we have successfully launched the strategic arms
                        limitations talks; we have agreed with the Soviet Union on a draft treaty
                        banning the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the ocean floor;
                        we are seeking to discuss arrangements to normalize access to Berlin; we
                        have negotiated intensively, but with disappointing results so far, to find
                        a framework on which the parties may negotiate a lasting settlement in the
                        Middle East; and we have indicated a willingness to negotiate with the
                        Warsaw Pact nations on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>We shall make some proposals next week to the Communist Chinese in Warsaw in
                        the hope that we can improve relations with them.</p>
                    <p>On the second point—encouraging greater responsibility for regional
                        leadership by the nations of the area—we have moved forward in Europe, Asia,
                        and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>To our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has offered to consult more on
                        subjects of mutual concern. This has eliminated the fear of unilateral
                        action, and our Western allies are appreciative.</p>
                    <p>In Asia our friends and allies have agreed that henceforth, if it should be
                        required, they will provide the necessary military forces to cope with
                        subversion, both internally and externally promoted, with the United States
                        providing appropriate support by way of equipment and training, et cetera.
                        We have agreed, too, that the proper role of the United States is that of
                        partner and participant in regional activities, for which Pacific and Asian
                        countries will undertake initiatives and provide leadership. This is the way
                        we want it and the way the Asians want it.</p>
                    <p>In Latin America a comparable development has taken place. In accord with our
                        neighbors to the south, we are proceeding on the basis of a more mature and
                        a more equal partnership. Our hemisphere friends have accepted
                        responsibility for providing a leading voice in <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169"
                            facs="0189"/>inter-American affairs and in setting their own course in
                        the struggle for economic development and social reform.</p>
                    <p>I have not mentioned Africa, but next month I shall visit Africa. I will in
                        particular discuss with African leaders their views of how best to find a
                        steady, long-term basis for relating our interest in helping them raise
                        standards of living to their own efforts.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I believe that the United States, under the leadership of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, has had a successful year
                        in the conduct of its foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I want to underscore that the foreign policy of this administration
                        cannot be characterized as tending toward isolationism—as a curtailment of
                        interests or a shedding of responsibility in world affairs. We cannot
                        retreat from a world in which we will increasingly be involved, however
                        longingly some might glance in that direction.</p>
                    <p>What we can do and what we propose to do is to alter the character of our
                        involvement, to make that involvement more consistent with present-day
                        realities, to give it a sound footing for the long term. We can be less
                        intrusive and less domineering. We can have a lower profile. We can speak
                        with a less strident voice. By working more effectively with other nations,
                        by conducting our international affairs with a bit more modesty, we hope
                        that we may become more successful and effective partners in the search for
                        peace and security in the world during this last third of the 20th
                        century.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Speaker</persName>, Mr. President, my colleagues in the
                        Congress, our distinguished guests and my fellow Americans:</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are general introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>When we speak of America's priorities the first priority must always be peace
                        for America and the world.</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0190"/>
                    <p>The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the war
                        in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered—not so much as
                        the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we had the
                        courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next
                        generation was able to keep.</p>
                    <p>We are making progress toward that goal.</p>
                    <p>The prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.</p>
                    <p>A major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of this
                        Congress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war, have
                        overwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace. By this action, you
                        have completely demolished the enemy's hopes that they can gain in
                        Washington the victory our fighting men have denied them in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>No goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this
                        century in which America was at peace with every nation in the world.</p>
                    <p>I shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve
                        this goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall submit to
                        the Congress at a later date.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Today, let me describe the directions of our new policies.</p>
                    <p>We have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not as it
                        was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II. Many of the policies
                        which were necessary and right then are obsolete today.</p>
                    <p>Then, because of America's overwhelming military and economic strength,
                        because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability
                        of scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even govern,
                        themselves, America had to assume the major burden for the defense of
                        freedom in the world.</p>
                    <p>In two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of the
                        money, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend their
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>Today the great industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, have regained
                        their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America—and many of the
                        nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after World War II in
                        Asia and Africa—have a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to
                        assume the responsibility for their own defense.</p>
                    <p>That is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d52fn3">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0191"/>
                    <p>Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively
                        or primarily an American undertaking.</p>
                    <p>The nations of each part of the world should assume the primary
                        responsibility for their own well-being; and they themselves should
                        determine the terms of that well-being.</p>
                    <p>We shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce our
                        involvement and our presence in other nations' affairs.</p>
                    <p>To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from
                        responsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.</p>
                    <p>The result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but to
                        give them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose.</p>
                    <p>Relations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy, based
                        on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility.</p>
                    <p>We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with those
                        nations as partners rather than patrons.</p>
                    <p>The new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia. We have developed an
                        historic new basis for Japanese-American friendship and cooperation, which
                        is the linchpin for peace in the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>If we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factor will
                        be the development of a new relationship between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with precision
                        and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation.</p>
                    <p>Our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have
                        far greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual
                        self-interest rather than naive sentimentality.</p>
                    <p>It is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with Communist
                        China in our talks at Warsaw.</p>
                    <p>Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a
                        catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of
                        our differences.</p>
                    <p>I would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and
                        dangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect
                        that America may have the best chance since World War II to enjoy a
                        generation of uninterrupted peace. And that chance will be enormously
                        increased if we continue to have a relationship between Congress and the
                        Executive in which, despite differences in detail, where the security of
                        America and the peace of mankind are concerned, we act not as Republicans,
                        not as Democrats, but as Americans.</p>

                                its significance for self-reliance, regionalism, etc., and having
                                emphasized the essentiality of our role in maintaining the relative
                                stability of a world structure composed of sovereign states, the
                                President could go on to say that for the long future such a
                                structure is not enough. We must look, rather, toward ways in which
                                the peacekeeping role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a
                                supra-national structure can be strengthened, ways in which the rule
                                of law can be expanded.</p>
                            <p>This can be said in a way, I think, which need not undercut the
                                realism and the practicality with which he approaches today's and
                                tomorrow's problems. To say it, however, could help to express the
                                larger vision called for by his State of the Union address. It
                                would, moreover, supply what has heretofore seemed to me a missing
                                ingredient in the articulation of our policy.</p>
                            <p>The theme would, of course, be an appropriate one for further
                                development in an address to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                on the celebration of its 25th anniversary.</p>

                        <item>The youthful idealism and impatience that have fastened on the squalor
                            and misery of our domestic ghettos is bound, I believe, eventually to be
                            extended to the vastly greater squalor and misery in which most of the
                            world lives. I just don't believe that young people who are so much
                            concerned with the poverty, hunger and disease within our own borders
                            will long continue to be indifferent to the much worse conditions beyond
                            our borders.<note n="3" xml:id="d53fn3">

                    <p>As the President said months ago in our <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting on foreign assistance, its most important justification is, after
                        all, moral. To sound this note and to affirm the goal of a more adequate
                        world order are the only ways I can think of for the President to sustain in
                        the foreign policy message the inspirational tone so impressively achieved
                        in his State of the Union message.</p>

                        ASIA: SOME HARD ISSUES</p>
                    <p>It is useful at the outset to recognize that there is no such thing as a
                        grand strategy for Asia. If we can restrain the natural impulse to package a
                        grand strategy, future discussions of American policy in Asia will be more
                        illuminating than past ones. Most treatment of possible U.S. post-Vietnam
                        Asian policies has tended to compartmentalize them neatly under strategic
                        labels that describe U.S. base postures and imply U.S. political postures,
                        e.g., “mainland”, “offshore”, “Pacific outposts”. Such treatment is
                        misleading. The strategic headings are oversimplified and just won't hold up
                        under the glare of Asian complexities. It is fruitless to try and draw
                        abstract defense lines which represent “vital interest” boundaries on which
                        we would “fight”. And even if we could construct a master plan, we would not
                        adhere rigidly to it for the sake of consistency if events dictated tactical
                        aberrations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine Is
                        Already Being Implemented</p>
                    <p>In current discussion of U.S. policy for post-Vietnam Asia, the conventional
                        wisdom is that: <list>
                            <item>—The President, Vice-President and Secretary of State during their
                                Asian trips have sketched the outlines of a significant new policy
                                for the region in the 1970s.</item>
                            <item>—However, this outline has as yet little operational significance,
                                and we must await specific actions in order to assess the real
                                implications of any new policy.</item>
                        </list>

                            <item>—Our various statements are very significant, demonstrating a new
                                tone and suggesting a new direction. However, if read literally, the
                                proposed policy is not all that different from the rhetoric of past
                                policy.</item>

                            <item>—What is even more significant is the many concrete actions that
                                we have already taken or plan to take which have us moving down a
                                clear policy path. These actions, although often not taken with a
                                strategic concept in mind, are already putting flesh on our
                                pronouncements and demonstrating that there is indeed a significant
                                new policy thrust.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are beginning to implement what in the past we attempted only in part,
                        paid lip service to, or postponed to a vague longer term. There are already
                        many examples and they are beginning to form a consistent pattern, even if
                        this has not been consciously constructed. In some cases our actions have
                        been proposed to us by others—but we have not resisted as we might have
                        previously. In other cases we are taking actions for reasons not primarily
                        keyed to an Asian strategy—but they are consistent with our approach
                        nevertheless. In many cases we are making moves with an awareness of the
                        general direction they are taking us. We do not yet appear to be following
                        any policies which are strikingly discordant with our overall approach.
                        However, Laos—where we have yet to make a clear choice—holds the potential
                        for a very serious diversion.</p>

                        as words. What remains to be determined—and this of course is crucial—is how
                        we manage the trend and cumulative impact of our policy and how we apply our
                        new approach to the really tough questions that we will face in the

                    <p rend="center">Some Hard Issues for the 1970s</p>
                    <p>It is useful to run through the major components of our Asian approach and
                        suggest some of the difficult questions that they could involve during the
                        next decade. The following is by no means exhaustive and includes some
                        relatively unlikely contingencies as well as predictable issues. There is no
                        attempt to explore the questions in depth or recommend U.S. actions. In some
                        cases the policy implications of our new approach seem clear. In many
                        instances—unsurprisingly—the general guidelines don't give us the answer
                        now. We cannot paint in all the factors in advance; a degree of ad hocism is
                        necessary. This section is designed to locate some of the issues imbedded in
                        our Asian policy components and to begin exploring their ramifications.
                        These issues are not treated in any particular order of importance.</p>

                    <p>“Commitment” is a slippery concept. Our actions on specific cases will be
                        guided not by legal phrases but by an assessment of the significance of our
                        interests involved and the nature of the threat. We have said we will
                        “honor” our formal treaty obligations and these are imprecise in the areas
                        where the definition of our interests is especially imprecise. <pb n="177"
                            xml:id="pg_177" facs="0197"/>Some specific examples come to mind. Our
                        defense obligations for the offshore islands have been purposely ambiguous
                        to maintain our flexibility and keep Peking guessing. Our explicit
                        commitment is to help defend Taiwan and the Penghus only. Presidential
                        discretion is formally reserved for the offshore islands, which the U.S.
                        would defend only if the President deems such action necessary to secure
                        Taiwan/Penghus. There are no indications that Peking intends to move against
                        the islands, but such a contingency is plausible in the 1970s, if, for
                        example, the communists misread the reduction in our Taiwan Straits patrol.
                        Our new Asian approach does not predict our reaction, especially if we are
                        confronted with pressures like a blockade rather than a naked assault.</p>
                    <p>We have encouraged Australia and New Zealand to maintain ground and air
                        forces in Malaysia and Singapore after 1971 when the British will have
                        withdrawn. To date our allies have agreed to do so and have not pressed us
                        very hard on the applicability of our <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"
                            >ANZUS</gloss> commitments to their forces in the Malaysia-Singapore
                        area. However, Australian and New Zealand intentions are not firm and they
                        continue to seek general reassurance of American help if their forces get
                        into trouble. As 1971 draws near they could press us for more specific
                        understandings under <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> (which
                        obligates us only in the “Pacific area” as well as homelands) as the price
                        for maintaining a forward presence. We would then have to weigh our
                        objectives of regional cooperation and a greater allied defense role against
                        the principle of no new “commitments.” The threat to Malaysia-Singapore
                        seems sufficiently remote and our aversion to new obligations sufficiently
                        strong to suggest that we might forego the forward allied presence.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to defense of the Philippines, and the enemy need not be
                        “communist”. Presumably we would choose to stay out of Philippine
                        hostilities with Malaysia over Sabah, but this could involve some bending of
                        our mutual treaty.</p>
                    <p>Our obligation to defend South Korea is unambiguous. How would we interpret
                        this obligation if our allies initiated hostilities or if it were at least
                        clear that Seoul provoked Pyongyang? Such a contingency might look more
                        likely if there were a substantial reduction in U.S. troops, and with it
                        U.S. operational control, in South Korea.</p>

                    <p>India is likely to pose this issue. It has a nuclear capability, fears the

                        importance to countries like India we stressed their unimportance to
                        Senators like Fulbright. Indian nationalism and the Chinese threat could
                        induce New Delhi to demand from us (and the Soviets) much more explicit
                        nuclear assurances as the price of nuclear abstention. We would have to
                        choose between our objectives of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and
                        non-proliferation of U.S. “commitments”.</p>
                    <p>Japan is the other prime nuclear candidate in Asia—it too is on the nuclear

                        Unlike the Indian case, we cannot be much more explicit in our nuclear
                        assurances for Japan. If it inclines towards the nuclear club it will mean
                        that it is shedding its unique nuclear aversion and it prefers to assume its
                        own defense against China. Such a development would be a function of growing
                        Japanese nationalism/militarism and declining confidence in the American
                        umbrella. Would this necessarily be against our long range interests? If so,
                        what steps, if any, would we take—could we take—to keep Japan from going

                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine for Asia. It was based on a
                        realistic downgrading of likely threats, the feeling that five or six
                        divisions couldn't stop Chinese hordes anyway, the aversion to another Asian
                        ground war, and the need for defense budget savings. We have recognized in
                        effect that for Asia we have been spending a great deal of money for forces
                        that we suspect are insufficient against a threat which we do not believe
                        will materialize.</p>
                    <p>Closely related to the numbers of our Asian divisions is their deployment.
                        Our main decision will be in South Korea where the return of capable ROK
                        forces from Vietnam (if not before) will provide a logical opportunity to
                        implement our new approach of greater allied self-reliance and a lower
                        American profile by slicing our two divisions.</p>
                    <p>The fact remains that we are taking a gamble, albeit sensible and conscious.
                        We judge conventional aggression in Asia to be both unlikely and containable
                        by our allies, including in Korea where the threat is <pb n="179"
                            xml:id="pg_179" facs="0199"/>most plausible. Reduction of our
                        capabilities, however, at best will not decrease the threat of conventional
                        aggression (although some would argue that a less “provocative” American
                        posture could ease tensions). It might tempt potential adversaries. Our new
                        Asian approach does not—cannot—instruct us in advance on how we would meet
                        our treaty obligations and assist an overwhelmed ally when we have
                        substantially less power than we do now. We would have to explore our
                        options of military assistance, air and naval support, mobilization,
                        tactical and strategic nuclear response.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Our public and background statements have all but ruled out the use of U.S.
                        troops in any future insurgency. This is an unchallengeable policy where the
                        conflict is wholly domestic, such as Malay-Chinese communal strife in
                        Malaysia. Or where external support for the insurgency is clearly limited,
                        such as Burma (where in addition we have little interest). Or where outside
                        help, though significant, does not tip the scales against the target
                        government, such as Thailand today.</p>
                    <p>Our new Asian approach is, however, obscure on those cases where massive
                        external intervention shades the nature of the conflict from insurgency
                        towards conventional aggression, such as happened at some point (whether
                        before or after American intervention is debatable to say the least) in
                        South Vietnam. Laos, with 50,000 North Vietnamese troops, and perhaps 5,000
                        Chinese, is the obvious present case. Our equivocation there reflects not
                        only what we inherited in the past and the linkage with Vietnam but also our
                        uncertainty about how to apply our Asian doctrine in the future. One doubts,
                        for example, that a couple of years ago we would have displayed our current
                        restraint on the Chinese road-building exercise. No one advocates committing
                        American ground forces to Laos, but American manpower is there, however we
                        may choose to label pilots and Meo advisers as non-combat personnel. We do
                        not know what we will do if the enemy, who can overrun Laos if they wish,
                        decide to do so. Our diplomatic and military maneuvers are designed to
                        forestall this contingency, but if we fail we presumably will let Laos go
                        rather than risking another Vietnam-type quagmire.</p>
                    <p>This would bring us of course to Thailand. A communist takeover of Laos could
                        lead to greatly increased external support for the Thai insurgents. There
                        might be the prospect of semi-conventional aggression, with thousands of
                        North Vietnamese forces, Chinese advisers. In this situation Bangkok could
                        present us with two choices: massive U.S. <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180"
                            facs="0200"/>reassurances or Thai accommodation with their adversaries.
                        The former would have to consist of actions, such as increased military
                        assistance and probably American deployments, as well as words, which would
                        sound hollow to our ally after Vietnam and Laos. Our other option would be
                        acquiescence in Thai overtures to Hanoi and Peking which would no doubt have
                        to include Thai neutrality, renunciation of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>, and removal of all American bases and troops. Would this
                        be more palatable than direct American intervention and would it be
                        consistent with our new Asian approach?</p>

                        supportive, less conspicuous role. Reduction in the American presence, both
                        in Vietnam and generally, will have both military and economic impact on
                        various countries. We expect them to become more self-reliant, but at least
                        for certain countries for a certain transitional period compensatory
                        American assistance might be in order. This need runs up against a Congress

                        assistance. A coherent Administration approach and strong Presidential
                        leadership will be required. Perhaps the political and budgetary appeal of a
                        leaner American deployment abroad will produce Congressional support for the
                        aid levels needed to ease the way. However, if Congress remains balky, we
                        might face choices on slowing down our Asian slimming process or running
                        some security, political or economic risks in the area. This general problem
                        will translate into specific issues such as which countries should receive
                        priority; the tradeoffs between military and economic assistance; the proper
                        use of Vietnam surpluses, etc.</p>
                    <p>Our future emphasis on Asian prescriptions has relevance for our aid
                        programs. This emphasis suggests that we will encourage Asian nations (and
                        regional groupings) to fashion their own security and development needs and
                        then come to us with their proposals. Aside from aid levels and priority
                        recipients, we might face some sticky questions concerning the nature of the
                        proposed hardware or projects. As donor—but less as seller—of the goods and
                        services, we obviously have a strong say on what transactions make sense.
                        Nevertheless our new themes of Asian initiative and Asian definition may
                        make it more awkward for us than now to turn down a request for a jet plane
                        (which we don't think fits the country's security needs) or a steel mill
                        (which we <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0201"/>think deserves a lower
                        priority) that the recipient country deems important. It would be more
                        awkward still if a regional grouping presented the request. For economic
                        assistance, we can often use multilateral groups—such as the <gloss
                            target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_ADB1">ADB</gloss>—as
                        a buffer; we cannot do so on military requests.</p>
                    <p>Our aid and trade policies are closely related, and we face some tough Asian
                        trade issues in the 1970s. The goal of our aid program is to help developing
                        countries stand on their own: Taiwan is a recent graduate, Korea a
                        prospective one. Both are prospering, bolstered by healthy exports in fields
                        our aid programs have encouraged. Their economic performances rely heavily
                        on the American market as our textile manufacturers well know. They will in
                        any event need to find new markets for their expanding exports, but
                        restricting their access to our own greatly exacerbates their difficulties.
                        So will the fading of economic stimuli from the Vietnam War. There may be
                        good domestic reasons for limiting our imports from our friends, but such a
                        policy clashes with our aid policy and our objectives of greater Asian
                        development and self-reliance.</p>

                        the upcoming adjustments in our Philippine arrangements. Our formal ties
                        with Korea present no immediate issue. As already noted, possible problems

                    <p>Our handling of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> is less clear. It is

                        to Thailand. French and Pakistani membership are meaningless, the British

                        our options on <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> boil down to either

                    <p>Being against regionalism is like being against motherhood. We have always
                        endorsed the principle of regional cooperation, with the major policy
                        questions centering on the extent to which we led and shaped regional
                        efforts. We are now set on a more reactive and supportive course where we
                        will encourage Asian leadership. However, our encouragement can take many
                        forms. For example, we recently tried to relate prospective arms sales to
                        Singapore to its cooperation with Malaysia and to regional Commonwealth
                        defense efforts with Australia, New Zealand and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                    <p>This minor issue shadows significant future decisions wherein we will have to
                        weigh other countries' national prerogatives and U.S. restraint against our
                        desire to encourage regionalism. Will we balk at an Asian country's
                        prescription when it appears to undercut regional cooperation? Will we try
                        to induce regionalism through our assistance policies even though this
                        suggests a more aggressive American role in shaping Asian ventures? Does our
                        emphasis on Asian initiative mean that we merely sit back and wait for
                        regional groupings to get together, no matter how faltering the pace, or
                        will we be prepared to make suggestions to promote their cooperation?</p>

                        some of our responsibilities. We know that we want Japan to increase its
                        economic assistance, its political clout, even its self-defense capacity. We
                        do not know the degree to which we want Japan to participate or take the
                        lead in regional security efforts. Are we—and the rest of Asia—not too close
                        to World War II to contemplate easily a remilitarized Japan? Even a strong
                        Japanese economic and military presence could disturb other Asians. For
                        example, Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik has just told our Ambassador of

                        disturb other Asian countries and would clash with our new doctrine of Asian

                            >SALT</gloss> discussions. ‘You know and I know’, he said, ‘that it is
                        essential that we don't have a nuclear blowup. You recognize that better
                        than any other world leader.’ The Prime Minister said that the Soviet
                        military leaders have more power than the military in our own countries. The
                        President said our line at the talks is this: First, we want agreement; we
                        want to be forthcoming. Second, we won't give up any cards in advance. On
                        Vietnam, he said, our best position is to <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185"
                            facs="0205"/>accept Russian help, but not to ask for it. They won't help
                        us because we ask them; they will help us because they will face the
                        necessity.</p>
                    <p>“Returning to <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, the President said that
                        before talks began he had had very little optimism. Now he thinks there's a
                        chance they may need a control on arms because of their problem with the
                        Chinese. A situation may be arising where self-interest requires give and
                        take.</p>
                    <p>“He then asked <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> to comment on
                        the possibilities for a détente. <persName corresp="#p_WJH2"
                            >Wilson</persName> said he agreed with everything the President had
                        said, and added that anything that makes the Soviet Union swallow their
                        words on Germany is harder than either on <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss> or Vietnam. We have told <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"

                        continued, that the Common Market may be a good way to contain Germany.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> said he had the impression
                        that the President, through his very subtle China policy, was trying to use
                        China to ruffle the back hair of the Soviets. The President said we just
                        don't want them to take us for granted.” (Memorandum of conversation;

                    <p>At a National Security Council meeting on January 28, 1970, with British
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName> attending,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> emphasized the
                        importance of coordinating with Western European allies in formulating an
                        approach to the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>“Often we read that the columnists say that Europe does not really matter.
                        What is needed is for the United States and the Soviet Union to sit down and
                        cool the whole process. If this means cooling relations with our Western
                        European friends they say, then so be it. If it means antagonizing
                        China—again, so be it.</p>
                    <p>“As I said in February and again in August, I reject this approach
                        categorically. First, there is no reduction of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> commitment. Certainly this can be a matter for
                        negotiation, but we cannot reduce our level of commitment except on a mutual
                        basis. Second, on Soviet-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations, there
                        is not a lack of interest in finding an arrangement, but it is vitally
                        important to establish a relationship within the Alliance. We must know what
                        we are going to talk about before getting into summitry.”</p>

                    <p>Later in the discussion, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        outlined his support for the development of a strong, independent European
                        community which could provide “friendly competition” for the United
                        States:</p>
                    <p>“I have never been one who believes the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        should have control of the actions of Europe. It is in the interests of the
                        United States to have a strong economic, political and military European
                        community, with the United Kingdom in that community. I have preferred that
                        Europe move independently, going parallel with the United States. A strong,
                        healthy and independent Europe is good for the balance of the world. For the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to play a heavy-handed role would be
                        counter-productive. What we want is friendly competition with the United

                    <p>A general reaction to the State of the World message<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d57fn2">Reference is to the foreign policy report submitted to
                            Congress on February 18; see <ref target="#d60">Document
                            60</ref>.</note> is that it might be strengthened to knock down the
                        assumption that is gaining disturbing currency abroad and in the United
                        States—that this Administration is on an irreversible course of not only
                        getting out of Vietnam but of reducing our commitments around the world. I
                        realize that this thesis is answered in several places with phrases like
                        “This is not a retreat from our obligations but a sharing of obligations,”
                        but this is not enough. I think high up in the lead of the introductory
                        statement should be some strong assertions to the effect that the United
                        States recognizes that because of our economic and military position the
                        fate of freedom and peace in the last third of this century will depend upon
                        how we meet our responsibilities in the world. We did not ask for this role
                        but now because the force of circumstances has imposed it upon us we shall
                        meet our responsibilities. However, we believe that our goal of nations <pb
                            n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0207"/>living in independence and freedom
                        in a peaceful world will be better achieved if other nations assume
                        responsibilities to the extent of their capabilities just as we do.</p>
                    <p>In other words, get back to my theme that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> doctrine rather than being a device to get rid of
                        America's world role is one which is devised to make it possible for us to
                        play a role—and play it better, more effectively than if we continued the
                        policy of the past in which we assume such a dominant position. I would
                        suggest that you take a look at the Colorado Springs speech<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d57fn3">See <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note>—some of
                        the tone and strength of that speech on this issue is very much needed in
                        the introductory portion.</p>
                    <p>I realize that your staff may well object to this because the peacenik types
                        who will be primarily the reading audience for this report will want to find
                        any evidences possible which will give comfort to their feeling that “the
                        United States should reduce its world role and start taking care of the
                        ghettoes instead of worrying about Afghanistan.”</p>
                    <p>For over twenty years, however, I have been saying “that we can have the best
                        social programs in the world—ones that will end poverty, clean up our air,
                        water and land, provide minimum income, etc., and it isn't going to make any
                        difference if we are not around to enjoy it.” I am not suggesting that this
                        be put into the report in such specific, blunt terms but the thought must be
                        put in just as strongly because I feel that the people of the country and
                        even more so our troubled allies in Asia and Europe, as well as our
                        potential enemies, need to hear this.</p>

                    <p>Q. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, the President used
                        the word “watershed” in introducing this briefing this afternoon.<note n="2"

                            statement on foreign and defense policy ever made in this country.” As
                            such, he styled it “a watershed in American foreign policy.” (<hi

                            p. 114)</note> If I understand watershed correctly, it means a
                        separation, division, going in a new direction. I have not had a chance to
                        read this. What are the watershed points in this foreign policy
                        statement?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What the President
                        meant is the fact that there now exists a comprehensive, philosophical
                        statement of American foreign policy. It makes it clear that for better or
                        worse our policies are not simply tactical responses to immediate
                        situations, but that there exists a coherent picture of the world; that we
                        are taking our action in relation to this picture; and that this document
                        outlines his experience in foreign policy, national security policy and his
                        expectations for the future.</p>
                    <p>So whatever debate is generated by this would have to be in terms of a
                        general concept of foreign policy and not simply in terms of tactical
                        responses to immediate situations.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, it is his belief and it is the Administration's belief that we are
                        reaching the end of the post-war era, the end of the post-war era in the
                        sense that in the immediate period after World War II the United States,
                        among the non-Communist countries, was the only one that had emerged from
                        the war with its society and its economy relatively intact. Therefore, it
                        was natural that the United States would assume a predominant role anyplace
                        where it felt that security of the non-Communist world was threatened.</p>
                    <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0209"/>
                    <p>This, in turn, imposed on us the requirement that we were trying to remedy
                        immediate crisis situations rather than deal with the overall structure of
                        peace, or, rather, we identified the overall structure of peace with the
                        solution of immediate crisis.</p>
                    <p>This is ending now for a number of reasons. It is ending, according to this
                        document and our convictions, because many other parts of the world have now
                        regained a degree of cohesion, have grown into independence, which was, of
                        course, not the case at the end of World War II, and are capable of assuming
                        a greater responsibility, both for their security and for their
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>In these conditions, the United States should not be the fireman running from
                        one conflagration to the other, but can address itself to the longer-term
                        problems of a peaceful international structure and leave to local
                        responsibilities the immediate task of construction.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the United States will participate where it can make a
                        difference. It will attempt to contribute to the creation of regional
                        organization where that is appropriate, but the United States in this new
                        era will have to change its position from one of predominance to one of
                        partnership.</p>
                    <p>Now, we recognize—and to pick up a point that the President made in
                        introducing this report—that there is a danger that in moving from
                        predominance to partnership some people may believe that we are moving
                        towards disengagement or returning to isolation. This is not the philosophy
                        of this Administration.</p>
                    <p>The philosophy of this Administration is to find a basis for a long-term
                        engagement in the world, one that is consistent with the realities of the
                        contemporary world, one that we can sustain over an indefinite period of
                        time, and one that will give an impetus to our foreign policy of the same
                        order that the Marshall Plan conception did to the conditions of 1947. Those
                        conceptions were appropriate to the realities of the '40s and '50s and early
                        '60s and we are attempting to find conceptions that are appropriate to the
                        realities of the '70s.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are exchanges with reporters about questions arising from the
                        report.]</p>
                    <p>Q. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, I am not sure from
                        all of this whether you think the Cold War is increasing or lessening. Do
                        you think it is increasing or lessening from this broad philosophical
                        statement?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Cold War, as it
                        came to be known in the immediate post-war period, we would say has in that
                        forum lessened. At that time, there was a belief in a monolithic communism,
                        and that no longer exists in this forum.</p>
                    <p>At that time, there was a belief in the notion of irreconcilable hostility.
                        On the other hand, we believe that there are objective causes for <pb
                            n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0210"/>the tension that has existed over
                        this period. We believe that we are doing no one a service by pretending
                        that these tensions do not exist or that they can be removed by mere
                        atmospherics.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to negotiate seriously, either individually or
                        comprehensively, on these issues with either of the great Communist
                        countries. And, therefore, the foreign policy that was appropriate to the
                        period that was called the Cold War is not appropriate to the period into
                        which we believe we are now entering.</p>
                    <p>But we make this statement without under-estimating that there are still
                        serious causes of tension, that ideology is not dead, even though it has
                        changed some of its character, and that large areas of potential discord and
                        of hostility remain. But we are prepared to work seriously, and as
                        energetically as we can.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of the leadership meeting was devoted to discussion of the State of

                    <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0211"/>
                    <p>The President opened the discussion by saying his message would cover foreign
                        and defense policy of the entire world. It was in effect 40,000 words of
                        policy. He described it as the most important statement made by this
                        Administration; that all our foreign and defense policies had been gathered
                        together in one place, that there would be a summary of 3,000 words, and a
                        briefing had been held on the total message and one would be held this
                        afternoon for the bipartisan leadership. The message had been put together
                        over many weeks. It had been put into its final form over the weekend in Key
                        Biscayne. The President described it as interesting reading, and not hard
                        reading.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> outlined the extensive message
                        and his discussion took about three quarters of an hour. At the end of it,
                        the President interjected a number of comments in response to some points
                        that had been raised. On Japan for example, the President said it was
                        absolutely indispensable for political reasons that we train troops in
                        Japan, and that we have some U.S. forces there. In the event that China
                        should try to take on Japan, we would not, of course, try to fight it out
                        with conventional forces. The purpose of the troops was to maintain the U.S.
                        presence and involvement in the security of Japan.</p>
                    <p>Moving on to another point, the President said unless the United States does
                        play a role in the world, if, for example, the United States should return
                        home, the rest of the world in his opinion would come under Communist
                        domination.</p>
                    <p>One of the questions we answered, he said, is how we can meet our
                        responsibilities without draining ourselves economically and
                        psychologically. The purpose of this foreign policy is to find a way to stay
                        in the world, not a way to get out of the world. The message puts great
                        responsibility indirectly in its language on the other nations of the free
                        world to do more in their own behalf. They must assume an increasing share
                        of the burden of their own defense, said the President. Returning to Japan,
                        he said that while admittedly some time ago there was a good deal of
                        reluctance on the part of the Japanese to involve themselves in world
                        affairs, he wouldn't be surprised if “in five years we didn't have to
                        restrain them.” They have gone through a traumatic period since the bomb
                        dropped, he said. Now they are going to do something.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that he felt that in Asia the major counter-force to
                        China should not be the U.S. but Japan. He indicated that both the Chinese
                        and the Soviets recognized this; there had been far more interest in the
                        cables on the part of the Chinese and Russians in the reversion of Okinawa
                        to Japan than any other facet of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>Discussion of the difference between soft line and hard line began, and the
                        President said he would consider this policy neither. It is more a pragmatic
                        and realistic line, a peace line. He said in the past it has <pb n="192"
                            xml:id="pg_192" facs="0212"/>been his experience that the soft line has
                        led to war more often than the hard line. He can recall some two or three
                        occasions in the post-war era when a soft line resulted in a war where he
                        could not recall a single incident where a hard line had.</p>
                    <p>The President eschewed gushy optimism of any kind. He said that some
                        Americans think that we can rely on peace by sending a few Fulbright
                        scholars abroad or even Fulbright himself, but that doesn't bring peace. We
                        can avoid war if we are realistic and not soft-headed, he indicated.</p>

                        encouraging.</p>
                    <p>Moving on to the Middle East, he said that many American politicians took it
                        that it should be the basis of American foreign policy the simple question
                        of whether or not Israel is to survive. That cannot be the basis of American
                        foreign policy, he said. The interest of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> policy in the Middle East is designed to advance the United
                        States interests primarily. Those interests involve vital stakes in the
                        Mediterranean and Iran; they involve oil interests in the Arab world; they
                        also are coincidental with the survival of Israel as a state. For one hard
                        reason the Israelis are currently the strongest buffer against Soviet
                        expansion in the entire region.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what the Soviet objectives in the Middle East were, and
                        answered his own question. They want control of the Middle East; they want
                        the oil it contains; they want a land bridge to Africa. Looking over the
                        Middle East, the President said Tunis is too weak to matter. Morocco is
                        distant, out on the Atlantic Coast, and you know what happened in Libya.
                        Algeria, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Syria, Iraq, the Sudan are
                        all either under great Soviet pressure or Soviet influence at this time. As
                        for Spain, it has been relegated to outer darkness until Franco's death.
                        Italy is paying now for the opening to the left of a few years back, which
                        the President had opposed. We intend to see to it that Israel is not overrun
                        for the reason that Israel is the current most effective stopper to the
                        Mideast power of the Soviet Union. Our policy, said the President, will not
                        be pleasing to some of our political friends. But it is not in Israel's
                        interest for American policy to be one sided. Israel ought to make a deal
                        when it is strong enough to whip anyone in the Middle East and will be
                        strong enough for the next five years. The President said he indicated to
                            <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0213"/>Golda Meir when she was in the
                        country that he had only gotten 8% of the Jewish vote and he was supporting
                        the Israelis not for political reasons for the first time in recent history.
                        He was supporting Israel because it was in the interest of the United States
                        to do so.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of a visit to the United States by French
                        President Pompidou.]</p>
                    <p>Discussion was now brought up of the withdrawal of all American forces. The
                        President said he thought the withdrawal of all American forces from Europe,
                        for example, would be very detrimental policy. At the very least we ought to
                        retain a “trip-wire.” He said there is a significant shift indicated in this
                        statement. We are telling all Asia and Europe they must do more on their
                        part and we are going to do less on our part. Griffin<note n="5"

                        President should emphasize how he has reorganized and taken control of

                            Resolution was a non-binding resolution adopted by the Senate on June
                            25, 1969, which defined a national commitment and expressed the sense of
                            the Senate that a commitment could only result from a treaty, statute,
                            or concurrent resolution of both Houses of Congress providing for such a
                            commitment. As defined by the resolution, a national commitment involved
                            the promise or use of U.S. financial resources or armed forces to assist
                            a foreign country. S. Res. 85 is summarized in the <hi rend="italic"

                        I have no precise response on that.</p>
                    <p>Another point made by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        was that we are being “absolutely candid” with the American people on this.
                        With regard to someone recommending the proposal for mutual cooperation in
                        Latin America, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated it
                        should not be the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposition for “if it
                        is a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> proposal, it tends to be
                        counter-productive.” In other words, the countries of Latin America tend to
                        reject out of hand something that bears the American stamp of American
                        initiative. The President indicated that he would hope Congressmen would
                        pick out eight or ten points to be drawn from the message by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWL1">Safire</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> and others and repeat these points in speeches

                        now returned to the Mansfield resolutions.<note n="9" xml:id="d59fn9"
                            >Reference is apparently to the resolution introduced in the Senate on
                            December 1, 1969, by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield which called
                            for a “substantial reduction” of U.S. troops in Europe. Mansfield had
                            initially introduced this resolution in 1966. S. Res. 292 is summarized
                            in <hi rend="italic">Congressional Quarterly Almanac,</hi> Vol. XXV, p.
                            999.</note> He said that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        countries had not, were not, and are not doing their share and there was a
                        general feeling in the Senate that the only way they could be forced to do
                        so is for the reduction of American contribution to the <pb n="194"
                            xml:id="pg_194" facs="0214"/>effort. Allott said this is the feeling
                        that has to be considered when you take into account the vast American
                        investment in places like France and the pipeline arrangement we put into
                        France and our difficulty in getting satisfaction. The President said this
                        is a difficult problem, but if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> were to
                        withdraw now under the pressure of this resolution, the whole thing (<gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) would unravel. On the other hand, we do
                        have a new attitude. And we must remember we are there in Europe not to
                        defend Germany or Italy or France or England, we are in Europe to save our
                        own hides.</p>
                    <p>Returning again to the Middle East, he said as for Israel, it's a pretty weak
                        argument when we say we are supporting Israel for simply political reasons.
                        The strongest foundation for our support is that it is in our national
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Again to the Mansfield Resolution to bring home troops from Europe, if they
                        pass the resolution to bring home two divisions, said the President, it
                        would have a detrimental impact. We may do it ourselves, but we have to do
                        it our way.</p>
                    <p>The President then summarized a number of points that he had taken since his
                        Administration had begun that should be emphasized in speeches. First, his
                        new control and coordination of planning and foreign policy. Second, there
                        has been no major crisis with the Soviet Union. Third, there is
                        normalization of relations with Japan after the reversion of Okinawa.
                        Fourth, steps have been taken in <gloss target="#t_CBW1">CBW</gloss>
                        warfare. Five, the Middle East's problems were inherited. Six, we have
                        reopened lines of communication with Communist China. For a number of
                        reasons we have done this “which have nothing to do whatever with what we
                        think of them.” The President had made successful visits to Asia and Europe
                        which could not have been done under the previous administration. We have
                        put relations in Western Europe on a new perspective. We have re-established
                        contact with General DeGaulle, and from that contact come our current
                        discussions with Georges Pompidou.</p>

                                report, and as an agenda for action.” He anticipated that it would
                                “simultaneously guide our bureaucracy and inform foreign governments
                                about our thinking.” (<hi rend="italic">White House Years,</hi> p.

                    </p>
                    <p>When I took office, the most immediate problem facing our nation was the war
                        in Vietnam. No question has more occupied our thoughts and energies during
                        this past year.</p>
                    <p>Yet the fundamental task confronting us was more profound. We could see that
                        the whole pattern of international politics was changing. Our challenge was
                        to understand that change, to define America's goals <pb n="196"
                            xml:id="pg_196" facs="0216"/>for the next period, and to set in motion
                        policies to achieve them. For all Americans must understand that because of
                        its strength, its history and its concern for human dignity, this nation
                        occupies a special place in the world. Peace and progress are impossible
                        without a major American role.</p>
                    <p>This first annual report on U.S. foreign policy is more than a record of one
                        year. It is this Administration's statement of a new approach to foreign
                        policy to match a new era of international relations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">A New Era</p>
                    <p>The postwar period in international relations has ended.</p>
                    <p>Then, we were the only great power whose society and economy had escaped
                        World War II's massive destruction. Today, the ravages of that war have been
                        overcome. Western Europe and Japan have recovered their economic strength,
                        their political vitality, and their national self-confidence. Once the
                        recipients of American aid, they have now begun to share their growing
                        resources with the developing world. Once almost totally dependent on
                        American military power, our European allies now play a greater role in our
                        common policies, commensurate with their growing strength.</p>
                    <p>Then, new nations were being born, often in turmoil and uncertainty. Today,
                        these nations have a new spirit and a growing strength of independence.
                        Once, many feared that they would become simply a battleground of cold-war
                        rivalry and fertile ground for Communist penetration. But this fear
                        misjudged their pride in their national identities and their determination
                        to preserve their newly won sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Then, we were confronted by a monolithic Communist world. Today, the nature
                        of that world has changed—the power of individual Communist nations has
                        grown, but international Communist unity has been shattered. Once a unified
                        bloc, its solidarity has been broken by the powerful forces of nationalism.
                        The Soviet Union and Communist China, once bound by an alliance of
                        friendship, had become bitter adversaries by the mid-1960's. The only times
                        the Soviet Union has used the Red Army since World War II have been against
                        its own allies—in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956, and in
                        Czechoslovakia in 1968. The Marxist dream of international Communist unity
                        has disintegrated.</p>
                    <p>Then, the United States had a monopoly or overwhelming superiority of nuclear
                        weapons. Today, a revolution in the technology of war has altered the nature
                        of the military balance of power. New types of weapons present new dangers.
                        Communist China has acquired thermonuclear weapons. Both the Soviet Union
                        and the United States have acquired the ability to inflict unacceptable
                        damage on the other, no matter <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0217"
                        />which strikes first. There can be no gain and certainly no victory for the
                        power that provokes a thermonuclear exchange. Thus, both sides have
                        recognized a vital mutual interest in halting the dangerous momentum of the
                        nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>Then, the slogans formed in the past century were the ideological accessories
                        of the intellectual debate. Today the “isms” have lost their vitality—indeed
                        the restlessness of youth on both sides of the dividing line testifies to
                        the need for a new idealism and deeper purposes.</p>
                    <p>This is the challenge and the opportunity before America as it enters the
                        1970's.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Framework for a Durable Peace</p>
                    <p>In the first postwar decades, American energies were absorbed in coping with
                        a cycle of recurrent crises, whose fundamental origins lay in the
                        destruction of World War II and the tensions attending the emergence of
                        scores of new nations. Our opportunity today—and challenge—is to get at the
                        causes of crises, to take a longer view, and to help build the international
                        relationships that will provide the framework of a durable peace.</p>
                    <p>I have often reflected on the meaning of “peace,” and have reached one
                        certain conclusion: Peace must be far more than the absence of war. Peace
                        must provide a durable structure of international relationships which
                        inhibits or removes the causes of war. Building a lasting peace requires a
                        foreign policy guided by three basic principles: <list>
                            <item>—Peace requires partnership. Its obligations, like its benefits,
                                must be shared. This concept of partnership guides our relations
                                with all friendly nations.</item>
                            <item>—Peace requires strength. So long as there are those who would
                                threaten our vital interests and those of our allies with military
                                force, we must be strong. American weakness could tempt would-be
                                aggressors to make dangerous miscalculations. At the same time, our
                                own strength is important only in relation to the strength of
                                others. We—like others—must place high priority on enhancing our
                                security through cooperative arms control.</item>
                            <item>—Peace requires a willingness to negotiate. All nations—and we are
                                no exception—have important national interests to protect. But the
                                most fundamental interest of all nations lies in building the
                                structure of peace. In partnership with our allies, secure in our
                                own strength, we will seek those areas in which we can agree among
                                ourselves and with others to accommodate conflicts and overcome
                                rivalries. We are working toward the day when all nations will have
                                a stake in peace, and will therefore be partners in its
                                maintenance.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Within such a structure, international disputes can be settled and clashes
                        contained. The insecurity of nations, out of which so much conflict <pb
                            n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0218"/>arises, will be eased, and the
                        habits of moderation and compromise will be nurtured. Most important, a
                        durable peace will give full opportunity to the powerful forces driving
                        toward economic change and social justice.</p>
                    <p>This vision of a peace built on partnership, strength and willingness to
                        negotiate is the unifying theme of this report. In the sections that follow,
                        the first steps we have taken during this past year—the policies we have
                        devised and the programs we have initiated to realize this vision—are placed
                        in the context of these three principles.</p>

                        impatient people. Instead of teaching someone else to do a job, we like to
                        do it ourselves. This trait has been carried over into our foreign
                        policy.”</p>
                    <p>The postwar era of American foreign policy began in this vein in 1947 with
                        the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, offering
                        American economic and military assistance to countries threatened by
                        aggression. Our policy held that democracy and prosperity, buttressed by
                        American military strength and organized in a worldwide network of
                        American-led alliances, would insure stability and peace. In the formative
                        years of the postwar period, this great effort of international political
                        and economic reconstruction was a triumph of American leadership and
                        imagination, especially in Europe.</p>
                    <p>For two decades after the end of the Second World War, our foreign policy was
                        guided by such a vision and inspired by its success. The vision was based on
                        the fact that the United States was the richest and most stable country,
                        without whose initiative and resources little security or progress was
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>This impulse carried us through into the 1960's. The United States conceived
                        programs and ran them. We devised strategies, and proposed them to our
                        allies. We discerned dangers, and acted directly to combat them.</p>
                    <p>The world has dramatically changed since the days of the Marshall Plan. We
                        deal now with a world of stronger allies, a community of independent
                        developing nations, and a Communist world still hostile but now divided.</p>
                    <p>Others now have the ability and responsibility to deal with local disputes
                        which once might have required our intervention. Our contribution <pb
                            n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0219"/>and success will depend not on the
                        frequency of our involvement in the affairs of others, but on the stamina of
                        our policies. This is the approach which will best encourage other nations
                        to do their part, and will most genuinely enlist the support of the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>This is the message of the doctrine I announced at Guam—the “<persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine.” Its central thesis is that
                        the United States will participate in the defense and development of allies
                        and friends, but that America cannot—and will not—conceive all the plans,
                        design all the programs, execute all the decisions and undertake all the
                        defense of the free nations of the world. We will help where it makes a real
                        difference and is considered in our interest.</p>
                    <p>America cannot live in isolation if it expects to live in peace. We have no
                        intention of withdrawing from the world. The only issue before us is how we
                        can be most effective in meeting our responsibilities, protecting our
                        interests, and thereby building peace.</p>
                    <p>A more responsible participation by our foreign friends in their own defense
                        and progress means a more effective common effort toward the goals we all
                        seek. Peace in the world will continue to require us to maintain our
                        commitments—and we will. As I said at the United Nations,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d60fn4">See <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> “It is
                        not my belief that the way to peace is by giving up our friends or letting
                        down our allies.” But a more balanced and realistic American role in the
                        world is essential if American commitments are to be sustained over the long
                        pull. In my State of the Union Address,<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">See <ref
                                target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> I affirmed that “to insist
                        that other nations play a role is not a retreat from responsibility; it is a
                        sharing of responsibility.” This is not a way for America to withdraw from
                        its indispensable role in the world. It is a way—the only way—we can carry
                        out our responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>It is misleading, moreover, to pose the fundamental question so largely in
                        terms of commitments. Our objective, in the first instance, is to support
                        our interests over the long run with a sound foreign policy. The more that
                        policy is based on a realistic assessment of our and others' interests, the
                        more effective our role in the world can be. We are not involved in the
                        world because we have commitments; we have commitments because we are
                        involved. Our interests must shape our commitments, rather than the other
                        way around.</p>
                    <p>We will view new commitments in the light of a careful assessment of our own
                        national interests and those of other countries, of the specific threats to
                        those interests, and of our capacity to counter those threats at an
                        acceptable risk and cost.</p>

                            policies—as evidenced by our strengthened ties with Japan. Our
                            cooperation with Asian nations will be enhanced as they cooperate with

                            As South Vietnam grows stronger, the other side will, we hope, soon
                            realize that it becomes ever more in their interest to negotiate a just

                            questions at issue. Others must join us in recognizing that a settlement

                            from outside interference, and cooperative economic development. But we
                            will add our efforts to theirs to help realize Africa's great

                    </p>
                    <p>The second element of a durable peace must be America's strength. Peace, we
                        have learned, cannot be gained by good will alone.</p>
                    <p>In determining the strength of our defenses, we must make precise and crucial
                        judgments. We should spend no more than is necessary. But there is an
                        irreducible minimum of essential military security: for if we are less
                        strong than necessary, and if the worst happens, there will be no domestic
                        society to look after. The magnitude of such a catastrophe, and the reality
                        of the opposing military power that could threaten it, present a risk which
                        requires of any President the most searching and careful attention to the
                        state of our defenses.</p>
                    <p>The changes in the world since 1945 have altered the context and requirements
                        of our defense policy. In this area, perhaps more than in any other, the
                        need to re-examine our approaches is urgent and constant.</p>
                    <p>The last 25 years have seen a revolution in the nature of military power. In
                        fact, there has been a series of transformations—from the atomic to the
                        thermonuclear weapon, from the strategic bomber to the intercontinental
                        ballistic missile, from the surface missile to the hardened silo and the
                        missile-carrying submarine, from the single to the multiple warhead, and
                        from air defense to missile defense. We are now entering an era in which the
                        sophistication and destructiveness of weapons present more formidable and
                        complex issues affecting our strategic posture.</p>
                    <p>The last 25 years have also seen an important change in the relative balance
                        of strategic power. From 1945 to 1949, we were the only nation in the world
                        possessing an arsenal of atomic weapons. From 1950 to 1966, we possessed an
                        overwhelming superiority in strategic weapons. From 1967 to 1969, we
                        retained a significant superiority. Today, the Soviet Union possesses a
                        powerful and sophisticated strategic force approaching our own. We must
                        consider, too, that Communist China will deploy its own intercontinental
                        missiles during the coming decade, introducing new and complicating factors
                        for our strategic planning and diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these fateful changes, the Administration undertook a
                        comprehensive and far-reaching reconsideration of the premises and
                        procedures for designing our forces. We sought—and I believe we have
                        achieved—a rational and coherent formulation of our defense strategy and
                        requirements for the 1970's.</p>

                    <p>The importance of comprehensive planning of policy and objective scrutiny of
                        programs is clear: <list>
                            <item>—Because of the lead-time in building new strategic systems, the
                                decisions we make today substantially determine our military
                                posture—and thus our security—five years from now. This places a
                                premium on foresight and planning.</item>
                            <item>—Because the allocation of national resources between defense
                                programs and other national programs is itself an issue of policy,
                                it must be considered on a systematic basis at the early stages of
                                the national security planning process.</item>
                            <item>—Because we are a leader of the Atlantic Alliance, our doctrine
                                and forces are crucial to the policy and planning of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The mutual confidence that holds
                                the allies together depends on understanding, agreement, and
                                coordination among the 15 sovereign nations of the Treaty.</item>
                            <item>—Because our security depends not only on our own strategic
                                strength, but also on cooperative efforts to provide greater
                                security for everyone through arms control, planning weapons systems
                                and planning for arms control negotiations must be closely
                                integrated.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>For these reasons, this Administration has established procedures for the
                        intensive scrutiny of defense issues in the light of overall national
                        priorities. We have re-examined our strategic forces; we have reassessed our
                        general purpose forces; and we have engaged in the most painstaking
                        preparation ever undertaken by the United States Government for arms control
                        negotiations.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Partnership and strength are two of the pillars of the structure of a durable
                        peace. Negotiation is the third. For our commitment to peace is most
                        convincingly demonstrated in our willingness to negotiate our points of
                        difference in a fair and businesslike manner with the Communist
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>We are under no illusions. We know that there are enduring ideological
                        differences. We are aware of the difficulty in moderating tensions that
                        arise from the clash of national interests. These differences will not be
                        dissipated by changes of atmosphere or dissolved in cordial personal
                        relations between statesmen. They involve strong convictions and contrary
                        philosophies, necessities of national security, and the deep-seated
                        differences of perspectives formed by geography and history.</p>
                    <p>The United States, like any other nation, has interests of its own, and will
                        defend those interests. But any nation today must define its interests with
                        special concern for the interests of others. If some nations define their
                        security in a manner that means insecurity for other <pb n="203"
                            xml:id="pg_203" facs="0223"/>nations, then peace is threatened and the
                        security of all is diminished. This obligation is particularly great for the
                        nuclear superpowers on whose decisions the survival of mankind may well
                        depend.</p>
                    <p>The United States is confident that tensions can be eased and the danger of
                        war reduced by patient and precise efforts to reconcile conflicting
                        interests on concrete issues. Coexistence demands more than a spirit of good
                        will. It requires the definition of positive goals which can be sought and
                        achieved cooperatively. It requires real progress toward resolution of
                        specific differences. This is our objective.</p>

                    <p>This is the spirit in which the United States ratified the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty and entered into negotiation with the Soviet Union on control of the
                        military use of the seabeds, on the framework of a settlement in the Middle
                        East, and on limitation of strategic arms. This is the basis on which we and
                        our Atlantic allies have offered to negotiate on concrete issues affecting
                        the security and future of Europe, and on which the United States took steps
                        last year to improve our relations with nations of Eastern Europe. This is
                        also the spirit in which we have resumed formal talks in Warsaw with
                        Communist China. No nation need be our permanent enemy.</p>

                        tested by the change that lies ahead. The world of 1970 was not predicted a

                        move the world closer to a durable peace. And I know that Americans working
                        with each other and with other nations can make our vision real.</p>

                    <p>For discussion with the group and implementation.</p>
                    <p>After a great deal of consideration of our performance during the first year,
                        I have decided that our greatest weakness was in spreading my time too
                        thin—not emphasizing priorities enough. This may sound strange in view of
                        the fact that I did arrange my time to do the November 3rd speech and the
                        State of the Union adequately; but the balance of this memorandum will
                        demonstrate what I want implemented for the future. Also, while this applies
                        primarily to my time, I want <persName corresp="#p_EJD1"
                            >Ehrlichman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> to apply the same rules to allocating their time
                        to the extent that they find it possible.</p>
                    <p>What really matters in campaigns, wars or in government is to concentrate on
                        the big battles and win them. I know the point of view which says that
                        unless you fight all the little battles too that you do not lay the ground
                        work for winning the big ones. I do not agree with this point of view to the
                        extent that it means that I will have to devote any significant part of my
                        time to the lower priority items, or to the extent that <persName
                            corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> have to do so.</p>
                    <p>This means that there must be delegation to the Departments and within the
                        White House staff of complete responsibility for those matters which are not
                        going to have any major effect on our success as an Administration.</p>
                    <p>Applying this general rule to specifics, in the field of Foreign Policy, in
                        the future all that I want brought to my attention are the following
                        items.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>East-West relations.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Policy toward the Soviet Union.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Policy toward Communist China.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Policy toward Eastern Europe, provided it really affects East-West
                            relations at the highest level.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Policy toward Western Europe, but only where <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> is affected and where major countries (Britain,
                            Germany and France) are affected. <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205"
                                facs="0225"/>The only minor countries in Europe which I want to pay
                            attention to in the foreseeable future will be Spain, Italy, and Greece.
                            I do not want to see any papers on any of the other countries, unless
                            their problems are directly related to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. At the next level out where I am indicating policy
                            toward the Mid-East and then finally in the last is policy with regard
                            to Vietnam and anything that relates to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, etc. As
                            far as the balance of Asia is concerned, that part of Africa which is
                            not directly related to the Mid-East crisis, and all of Latin America
                            and all countries in the Western Hemisphere with the exception of Cuba
                            and anything else that may be concerned with the East-West conflict, I
                            do not want matters submitted to me unless they require Presidential
                            decision and can only be handled at the Presidential level.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>This is going to require a subtle handling on <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>'s part. He must not let members of his staff or
                        members of the establishment and the various Departments think that I do
                        “not care” about the under-developed world. I do care, but what happens in
                        those parts of the world is not, in the final analysis, going to have any
                        significant effect on the success of our foreign policy in the foreseeable
                        future. The thing to do here is to farm out as much of the decision-making
                        in those areas to the Departments, and where <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> does not have confidence that State will follow up
                        directives that I have previously laid down with regard to Latin America,
                        Africa and the under-developed countries of Asia, he should farm that
                        subject out to a member of his staff but he, himself, should not bother with
                        it. I want him to concentrate just as hard as I will be concentrating on
                        these major countries and these major problem areas.</p>
                    <p>In the future, all that I want to see with regard to what I consider the
                        lower priority items would be a semiannual report indicating what has
                        happened; and where a news conference is scheduled, of course, just enough
                        information so that I can respond to a question, although it is interesting
                        to note that we have received very few questions on the low priority items
                        in news conferences to date.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName>, in the arranging of my
                        schedule, have in mind these priorities. Great pressures will build up to
                        see this and that minor or major official from the low priority countries.
                        All of this is to be farmed out to Agnew. For example, the Minister of Mines
                        from Venezuela is a case in point; he should not have been included on the
                        schedule, and I do not want this to happen again.</p>
                    <p>With regard to domestic affairs, our priorities for the most part will be
                        expected but a couple will be surprising for reasons I will indicate.</p>
                    <p>I want to take personal responsibility in the following areas:</p>
                    <p>1. Economic matters, but only where the decisions affect either recession or
                        inflation. I do not want to be bothered with international monetary matters.
                        This, incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> should
                        note also, and I <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0226"/>will not need to
                        see the reports on international monetary matters in the future. Problems
                        should be farmed out, I would hope to Arthur Burns if he is willing to
                        assume it on a confidential basis, and if not Burns to Houthakker<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d61fn2">Hendrik S. Houthakker, member of the Council of Economic
                            Advisers.</note> who is very capable in this field. I have confidence in
                        the Treasury people since they will be acting in a routine way.
                        International monetary matters, incidentally, are a case in point in making
                        the difficult decision as to priorities. I feel that we need a new
                        international monetary system and I have so indicated in several meetings.
                        Very little progress has been made in that direction because of the
                        opposition of Treasury. I shall expect somebody from the White House staff
                        who will be designated who will keep the pressure on in this area. The man,
                        however, who could really be the lead man is Arthur Burns because he feels
                        exactly as I do and it might be that he could exert some influence on the
                        others. <persName corresp="#p_EJD1">Ehrlichman</persName>, of course, could
                        be helpful on the staff side but he is not familiar enough with the
                        intricacies of the problem to assume the lead responsibility.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is a rank ordering of the President's priorities on domestic
                        issues.]</p>
                    <p>In writing this memorandum I failed to include under the <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> section the national defense
                        positions. Here I am interested only in those positions where they really
                        affect our national security and East-West relations. That means that in the
                        case of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> I, of course, will consider that
                        a high-priority item as long as it is before us. Where an item like foreign
                        aid is concerned I do not want to be bothered with it unless it directly
                        affects East-West relations. I have already indicated in my meeting with
                            Pedersen<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Reference is to Rudolph Peterson;
                            see <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> (?) that I want some
                        reform here and I shall expect that reform to be accomplished in some degree
                        or the other.</p>
                    <p>A lot of miscellaneous items are not covered in this memorandum but I think
                        you will be able to apply rules based on what I have already dictated.</p>
                    <p>For example, trade policy is a case in point. This is something where it just
                        isn't going to make a lot of difference whether we move one way or another
                        on the glass tariff. Oil import is also a case in point. While it has some
                        political consequences it is not something I should become deeply involved
                        in. A recommendation should be made and responsibility given at other levels
                        and I will then act without getting involved at lower levels of the
                        discussion.</p>

                    <p>On March 26, 1970, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> sent to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> a policy overview prepared in the State Department on
                        the “U.S. and Africa in the 70's.” The 25-page paper ranged over the full
                        spectrum of relations with the nations of Africa. The essence of the
                        approach to Africa, as defined in the paper, derived in considerable measure
                        from a statement made by then Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> in 1957:</p>
                    <p>“We seek a relationship of constructive cooperation with the nations of
                        Africa—a cooperative and equal relationship with all who wish it. We are
                        prepared to have diplomatic relations under conditions of mutual respect
                        with all the nations of the continent. We want no military allies, no
                        spheres of influence, no big power competition in Africa. Our policy is a
                        policy related to African countries and not a policy based upon our
                        relations with non-African countries.</p>
                    <p>“As early as 1957, when he returned from a mission to Africa on behalf of
                        President Eisenhower, the then Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> recommended that the U.S. assign a higher priority to
                        our relations with Africa, which he recognized to be of growing importance
                        to the United States. Specifically he said:</p>
                    <p>“'The United States must come to know these leaders better, to understand
                        their hopes and aspirations, and to support them in their plans and programs
                        for strengthening their own nations and contributing to world peace and
                        stability. To this end, we must encourage the greatest possible interchange
                        of persons and ideas with the leaders and peoples of these countries. We
                        must assure the strongest possible diplomatic and consular representation to
                        those countries and stand ready to consult these countries on all matters
                        affecting their interests and ours.'” (Letter with attached enclosure from

                        spirit and dynamism of this continent and its people. I believe we now have

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Your letter of March 1 was most welcome.<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">In his
                            March 1 letter to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> wrote that he
                            did not object to talks between the United States and Communist China,
                            but he warned that accepting Peking's five principles of peaceful
                            coexistence or discussing the “so-called Taiwan problem” would be
                            “infringing on the sovereign rights of the Republic of China.” (Ibid.,

                                IV</ref>)</note> I greatly appreciated your frankness and your
                        sincere concern for the success of my efforts to bring a lasting peace to
                        East Asia.</p>
                    <p>From the conversations which we had together before I became President and
                        from the previous correspondence which we have exchanged, I know of your
                        deep distrust of Communist China's motives. In my own evaluation of
                        Communist China, I do not ignore the legacy of the past, nor do I ignore the
                        threat which the Chinese Communist regime may pose in the future. In my
                        report to the Congress of February 18, 1970 on United States Foreign
                            Policy,<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">
                            <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> I stated that in dealing
                        with the Communist countries we would not underestimate the depth of
                        ideological disagreement or the disparity between their interests and ours.
                        You may recall, too, that in my press conference of January 30 I cited the
                        potential danger to the United States posed by the growth of Communist
                        China's nuclear weapons capability.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, Mr. President, I believe that I would be remiss in my duty
                        to the American people if I did not attempt to discover whether a basis may
                        not exist for reducing the risk of a conflict between the United States and
                        Communist China, and whether certain of the issues which lie between us may
                        not be settled by negotiation. The alternative of maintaining a hostile
                        relationship indefinitely while weapons of mass destruction increase in
                        numbers and power is a terrible one, and demands that every reasonable
                        effort be made to promote understandings which will contribute to peace and
                        stability in Asia.</p>
                    <p>In undertaking this effort, I of course have in mind not only the essential
                        interests of the American people, but of our allies as well. In your letter
                        you have expressed concern for certain aspects of our talks <pb n="209"
                            xml:id="pg_209" facs="0229"/>with the Chinese Communists at Warsaw.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has received from
                        your Ambassador in Washington a detailed statement of your Government's
                        views on these matters and is replying to them.</p>
                    <p>I wish, however, to assure you personally and in the strongest terms of my
                        determination that there shall be no change in the firmness of our
                        commitment to the defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores and of my earnest
                        desire that these talks will not affect the friendship and close cooperation
                        which has existed between our Governments for so many years. I deeply value
                        our long personal relationship as candid friends and am confident that this
                        will serve us well in the future.</p>

                        however, some chance that he might and in any event we must do something
                        symbolic to help him survive. We have really dropped the ball on this one
                        due to the fact that we were taken in with the line that by helping him we
                        would destroy his “neutrality” and give the North Vietnamese an excuse to
                        come in. Over and over again we fail to learn that the Communists never need
                        an excuse to come in. They didn't need one in Hungary in 1956 when the same
                        argument was made by the career State people and when Dulles bought it
                        because he was tired and it was during the campaign. They didn't need one in
                            <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0230"/>Czechoslovakia when the same
                        argument was made by the State people, and they didn't need one in Laos
                        where we lost a precious day by failing to make the strike that might have
                        blunted the whole offensive before it got started, and in Cambodia where we
                        have taken a completely hands-off attitude by protesting to the Senate that
                        we have only a “delegation of seven State Department jerks” in the Embassy
                        and would not provide any aid of any kind because we were fearful that if we
                        did so it would give them a “provocation” to come in. They are romping in
                        there and the only government in Cambodia in the last 25 years that had the
                        guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand is ready to fall. I am
                        thinking of someone like Bob Murphy who would be sent there on a trip to
                        report back to me and who would go in and reassure Lon Nol. This, of course,
                        would be parallel to your activities which will be undertaken immediately

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> opened by stating the
                        ground rules for the meeting; namely, that he did not mind how they
                        characterized or described the meeting, but that in the interest of
                        promoting a frank discussion he did not want to be quoted. They agreed.</p>
                    <p>Q: <persName corresp="#p_BP1">Patrick</persName> Shea, Student Body President
                        from Stanford, read part of a resolution adopted by the Stanford Academic
                        Senate which, in effect, stated that they believed that the machinery which
                        was used for making decisions in the country did not seem legitimate and
                        that they were therefore sending a delegation to express their concern to
                        the President and to deliver to him a petition signed by 3,800 students from
                        Stanford. Mr. <persName>Shea</persName> stated that the violence, which
                        seemed to be increasing, was outrageous and that the situation was becoming
                        impossible; but that the students could not condemn the violence here when
                        what the U.S. government was doing in Southeast Asia was so violent. He
                        continued that there was what he called a “generational solidarity”
                        developing which was more than a gap and that the student generation was
                        seeking to mobilize itself to solve the problems which the older generation
                        did not seem to be able to solve.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was asked if he had
                        any comments. He replied that he thought Mr. <persName>Shea</persName>'s
                        remarks were too sweeping for direct comment but that he would like to start
                        by stating a few of his observations on the current situation. He stated
                        that we must assume that both sides realize that no one has a monopoly on
                        righteousness and that, as a former professor, <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212"
                            facs="0232"/>what students thought and felt was of great significance to
                        him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then expressed his
                        own personal view, drawing upon his practice while at Harvard to meet with
                        the <gloss target="#t_SDS1">SDS</gloss> members there in order to find out
                        what they represented. He concluded that they were characterized by two
                        things: one, extraordinary intensity and two, an extraordinarily superficial
                        knowledge of the facts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued that we agree
                        on ending the war in Vietnam; there is no doubt about that. We also agree
                        that it should be ended as quickly as possible. Our only difference is in
                        what is meant by “as quickly as possible.” This in his view was not worth
                        tearing the country apart. He then commented on the problem of the
                        generation gap which he felt was inevitable. In the present circumstances,
                        however, the younger generation had very good reason to attack the older
                        generation because, in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>'s opinion, his generation had failed—it had become
                        cynical and skeptical. It had “taken the clock apart” without being able to
                        put it together and it collapses and turns into mush when it is pushed.</p>
                    <p>Q: Mr. <persName>Shea</persName> commented that in the past a war would
                        destroy lives and property, but that today it might destroy humanity.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed and went on to
                        point out that even if we did away with all the nuclear weapons in the world
                        we would not have solved the problem of being able to destroy humanity since
                        you cannot destroy the technology—men would still know how to produce
                        nuclear weapons. The problem is how to relate knowledge to the preservation
                        of humanity.</p>
                    <p>Q: Professor Lewis asked what had occurred within the Administration since
                        March 18, the date of the Cambodian coup. It had been his understanding that
                        the Administration's policy was to contain the war but that it now appeared
                        that it was being expanded. China was even being brought into it in view of
                        its expressed solidarity with the Indochinese people. The resulting
                        situation therefore is not what he had understood the Administration's
                        objective to be. In short, what puzzled him was that it seemed that certain
                        political ramifications were not anticipated. Do the professors know more
                        than the policy-makers?</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he would
                        first like to make some general comments before answering the specific
                        question. In the process by which decisions are made it is possible for a
                        judgment to be wrong, but that does not justify attacking the fabric of the
                        society. The press has characterized this as an “invasion” of Cambodia. But
                        this territory was not controlled by the Cambodians. The primary objective
                        of the operation was simply to remove supplies, and it is limited in time.
                        (Shea interjected, “Even if Phnom Penh falls”?, and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied, “We intend to stick by
                        what we have said.”)</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0233"/>
                    <p>On the disaffection of political science professors, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he had seen the
                        impact of the war on academicians and that he understood their misgivings.
                        He pointed out that the thrust of their point of view had always been
                        against the war and that it was difficult for them to believe that anything
                        we did could be an improvement. Vietnamization was not a brilliant choice,
                        but it was the best we had in January of 1969. We had to respond not in
                        light of what people would think tomorrow but in light of what people would
                        think five years from now.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the events since March 18, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> stated that it may be difficult for the persons
                        present to believe but we had nothing to do with the overthrow of Sihanouk.
                        There were no <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> personnel there and, in
                        fact, we did not even have an Ambassador, but only a chargé d'affaires
                        there. Indeed, it would have been better for us to have Sihanouk in Cambodia
                        with a rough equilibrium than to have the conflict expand. We were, are, and
                        remain committed to extricating ourselves from Vietnam and ending the war.
                        We have made very strenuous efforts to bring about serious negotiations,
                        some of which cannot be made public at this time, and we continue to keep
                        these channels open.</p>
                    <p>In response to the question of whether or not the Administration had reversed
                        its policy and was now expanding the war, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> replied, “No, we were not altering our policy.” In
                        fact, the Administration believed that what it had done would shorten the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Q: Mr. <persName>Shea</persName> mentioned that earlier today they had talked
                        with Congressman McCloskey who stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> had recently told him that one of the two
                        alternatives of the Nixon plan for ending the war had failed.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that this was
                        untrue. What Mr. <persName>McCloskey</persName> may have been thinking of
                        was that our policy is based on two tracks—one negotiation, and two,
                        Vietnamization—and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        had told him that the negotiations were not proceeding as rapidly as
                        everyone had hoped.</p>
                    <p>Q: Professor Lewis then asked how much political input there had been in the
                        decision to attack the sanctuaries in Cambodia, whether it was based on soft
                        or hard intelligence, and why we had not let the dust settle before making
                        our decision.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he seems
                        to always be conducting both tactical and theoretical conversations
                        simultaneously. On the tactical side, there is no doubt that we ought to
                        talk to concerned people as to whether or not the tactical decision was
                        wise, but it does not seem to be worth tearing our campuses apart. On the
                        theoretical side, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        stated that his own conclusions, for what they were worth, were as follows:
                        The North Vietnamese people were a very heroic and <pb n="214"
                            xml:id="pg_214" facs="0234"/>tenacious people and they were very good at
                        making war, as their history proves. But the question remains as to whether
                        or not they can also make peace. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> noted that we also see this problem in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>The North Vietnamese tactic has been to sell us the beginning of negotiations
                        over and over again. Some people think that negotiating with them is like a
                        detective story in which they throw out vague clues and it is up to us to
                        discover them. There are a number of channels through which they can
                        communicate with us directly, and we believe that when they are serious
                        about negotiating they will not let us know through vague clues. The more
                        fundamental problem, however, is that they cannot conceive of sharing
                        political power. They want it foreordained that they will have control.</p>
                    <p>Q: Professor Lewis then asked whether we had given sufficient attention to
                        Sihanouk's position or whether we had gotten him into the situation which
                        brought about the coup.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that, for
                        what it was worth, his analysis of what caused Sihanouk's downfall was as
                        follows: First of all, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        stated that he considered Sihanouk a political genius in that he managed to
                        keep himself in power between the right and the left. This depended on his
                        maintaining Cambodia's international neutrality and his manipulating the
                        internal political structure so that he appeared to the Communists to be as
                        far left as he could be without provoking a reaction from the right.
                        Sihanouk therefore needed a strong right, and it was he who put Lon Nol and
                        Matak into power. Sihanouk, when he left the country, was trying through
                        political means to squeeze the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese there. He had
                        gone to Paris and was on his way to Moscow and Peking to pursue this course
                        on the diplomatic front. Consequently, he approved of Lon Nol's activities
                        since they gave him evidence of the troubles he was having on his right. The
                        result, however, was that the assumption by Lon Nol got out of hand and the
                        right wing took over. The problem now is that if Sihanouk came back he would
                        not be the same because the balance has changed. For this reason, we cannot
                        seek to bring him back. Our position has been the same as the French, the
                        U.K., and most every other nation (even the Chinese until yesterday) in that
                        we have continued to deal with the existing government.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the Lon Nol takeover, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
                        started to expand their sanctuaries. We warned them, publicly and privately,
                        and we even approached the Russians to try to discourage such expansion.
                        Finally we did not act against the sanctuaries until they moved out.</p>
                    <p>Q: A professor of anthropology stated that he wanted to impress upon Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> the gravity of the
                        situation on the campuses, that <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0235"/>the
                        middle ground had disappeared, and that there had been a drastic change.
                        After Cambodia it was not just a strike but a complete stoppage in order to
                        determine a political consensus as to what was to be done. This dissent was
                        not going to fade away and there was a growing feeling that one could not
                        work through the existing political structure.</p>
                    <p>Q: Another professor stated that in view of the report of the Cambodian
                        tribesmen being trained by the Green Berets, does this mean that we are now
                        going to go to “Cambodianization” and “Laosization.” He felt (1) that unless
                        we stopped the war our credibility would be zero, (2) that there was growing
                        feeling among academics that they could no longer be believed since their
                        universities were so closely related to defense operations, and (3) that
                        many of the students consider the war a racist war and that it was time for
                        us to get back to the problems of the United States. In this connection, he
                        mentioned that the attitude of the Vice President was not very helpful since
                        it seemed to represent a repressive atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Q: A Mexican-American student spoke next and explained how tired the minority
                        groups were with handouts. He said that he also spoke for the
                        Indian-American and Chinese-American students present in expressing the
                        frustration and alienation they felt with the system. He stated that they
                        did not feel that minority problems should be dealt with by programs. He
                        also felt that it was inconsistent to fight Communism in Europe with Radio
                        Free Europe but in Southeast Asia with bullets. He mentioned that minorities
                        die in the war at a disproportionately higher rate than do whites. Finally,
                        he stated that he was not concerned about saving the university since it was
                        so closely associated and involved with the war-death machine.</p>
                    <p>Another professor stated that Cambodia really was the straw that broke the
                        camel's back, that there had been great division and distrust on the
                        campuses already. He went on to state that if Cambodia is only a tactical
                        question and Vietnam is the moral question, what are the Administration's
                        long-range plans; or what kind of peace are we planning for in Asia?</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he
                        thought the students had given a correct and factual description of the
                        campuses of the country. The real question here is, faced with this
                        situation, what can be done? Cambodia made it easy for some to do what they
                        wanted to do anyway, but they confused a tactical question with a
                        fundamental question. The real issue is that any society to survive must
                        have a modicum of trust. The bureaucracy is the curse of the modern state,
                        and there is profound dissatisfaction with it. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that on the other hand he
                        did not know what student riots contributed to the solution of the problem.
                            <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0236"/>In order to have world order we
                        must maintain a modicum of confidence in authority. Anything worth doing
                        takes time and order.</p>
                    <p>It is a very simple rule but whenever the scope for action is the greatest,
                        the knowledge of the facts is the least. Whether an assessment is right or
                        wrong can never be proved until afterwards. Our view is that we must get out
                        of Vietnam in a way that the peace does not divide the country more than the
                        war. Historically, a student revolution has never succeeded. If there is a
                        revolution, it will not be by a bunch of upper-middle class college students
                        on the left, but by some other more uncivilized group on the right. We are
                        not playing with lives to prove our manhood. It may be one of the curses of
                        our age that to be thoughtful requires one to be tough.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the
                        Administration had made an effort to look many years ahead and to make
                        decisions which would produce the kind of world and peace vehicle we all
                        sought. Politics, however, is a grubby business and the easy decision is
                        usually the immediate tactical one. One does not always have the time or
                        room to make the decision that is in the long-term best interests of world
                        peace. There have been institutions, however, in which we have had room to
                        make long-range decisions such as in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> talks, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the
                        Chemical and Biological Warfare decision.</p>
                    <p>In Southeast Asia we do not believe that the situation is going to be
                        improved simply by giving economic aid. Nor do we subscribe to the more
                        conservative view that guerrilla warfare can solve all these problems. We
                        are trying to ask the right questions, to stop the pedantic Americanization
                        approach, and to get more regional cooperation. Our specific answers are not
                        going to be very profound but they will be even less promising if we have to
                        take a good part of our energy to deal with the present problems on our own
                        campuses.</p>
                    <p>Q: Dean Gibbs interrupted here to ask why there was so much reverse rhetoric,
                        for instance, from the Vice President, which in no way seemed conducive to a
                        forward look.</p>
                    <p>A: Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the
                        Administration had a spectrum of opinion and that each person there knew how
                        difficult it would have been for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> to have the dialogue he had had with them today if
                        they had met on the campus at Stanford. He concluded by saying that he
                        recognized the inadequacies of his own side, but that he also thought the
                        universities should recognize the inadequacies on their part and on the part
                        of their faculties. It seemed that too many professors were more interested
                        in being popular than in being right, and that a resolution voted on in a
                        large academic senate would tend to be the result of the emotions of the
                        moment.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BP1">Patrick</persName> Shea, the incoming Student
                        Body President, summed up the attitude of the students in a prepared
                        statement saying that they hoped the Administration would re-evaluate its
                        position in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        there were certain questions he would like to consider with them. Namely,
                        what ought to be the Federal role, even the Presidential role, regarding
                        student problems? Should the Federal government step into university
                        administration in some way? And the more sensitive question, What is, or
                        should be, the relationship of state and local governments and the national
                        guard to the university?</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0238"/>
                    <p>The President noted that the National Guard tends to be thought of as
                        Federal, even though it is not, which probably grew in part out of the
                        federalizing of national guard troops by President Eisenhower in Little
                        Rock.</p>
                    <p>He stated that there is probably no question that the Cambodian action
                        sparked a considerable amount of the current turmoil. Kent State certainly
                        dramatized it all.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">In a telephone conversation on
                            May 4 at approximately 4:45 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> that: “At Kent State there were 4 or 5 killed
                            today. But that place has been bad for quite some time—it has been
                            rather violent.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            suggested that they would be blamed for the killings and he noted that
                            33 university presidents were appealing to the President to leave
                            Vietnam. The President asked about the student strike, observing: “If it
                            is peaceful it doesn't bother me.” He worried, however, that if the
                            students were “out of classes they'll be able to raise hell.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought they would hold
                            teach-ins and possibly march on Washington. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> hoped “we can get some people of our own to speak
                            out.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation; Library of Congress,

                        college presidents for his action in Cambodia, an action that he had to
                        take, ironically, for the very reason that the demonstrations are about. He
                        stated that when the Cambodian action is completed in early June, he will
                        have bought at least ten months more time. Our actions in Cambodia avoid
                        either complete capitulation on the one hand or leaving our forces
                        indefensible on the other.</p>
                    <p>The President then went on to note that he met yesterday with six Kent State
                        students, all of whom were basically against the war in Viet Nam.<note n="5"

                            on the student demonstrations on June 8 when he told <persName

                        him that their purpose in coming to Washington was not just to protest the
                        war but to try and explain what was happening. The students noted that the
                        origin of the Ohio State disturbances had not been a protest against the war
                        but against the curriculum. The students said that the issue of Black Power
                        had actually started the demonstration at Kent State, although Cambodia and
                        Viet Nam were soon added as issues.</p>
                    <p>The President then noted that while he has made a difficult decision in
                        Cambodia, he is the one who must take the responsibility and see it through.
                        Nonetheless, he absolutely respects everyone's right to disagree.</p>
                    <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0239"/>
                    <p>The President went on to ask the broader question: Once we are out of
                        Cambodia, what happens? He stated that it would be a mistake to consider
                        that solving the war problem would solve the campus problem, and that we
                        must get to the more fundamental roots of the issue of campus turmoil.</p>
                    <p>The President passed on some more of the observations of the Kent State
                        students: the student body at Kent State is basically apathetic; a well
                        organized group of about 200 has been developing destructive activities; at
                        least 18,000 had not been involved in the disturbance but were spectators.
                        The students further pointed out that the student body generally hates the
                        City of Kent police, who they feel are ill trained; and finally they noted
                        that if the President of the school, or someone with like authority, had
                        stepped up and tried to negotiate the situation, the resulting tragedy might
                        not have occurred. The President indicated that the students might have been
                        naive in this conclusion; however, he indicated that the students said that
                        when the national guard comes on campus, the university administration
                        abdicates. Thus, the President raised the question of “communication” and
                        “control” between the national guard and the university administration.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that at Yale we sent troops at the governor's
                        request, but we had also been working with the situation quietly. He noted
                        that the October and November moratoriums had been handled by regular army
                        troops, who were better trained, and that even though there was $100,000
                        damage done in the city, no one was killed or injured. At this point the
                        President said that he had personally gotten the Court to waive the thirty
                        (fifteen?) day notice requirement for demonstrations for whatever
                        demonstrations are planned this Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what the Federal government can do, if anything, noting
                        that when state and local governments cannot handle situations the question
                        immediately becomes, “What is Washington going to do?” He said that the
                        usual answer is that we will study the problem and it is clear that students
                        would reject just another commission. The question today is, “What can we do
                        now”?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Nathan Pusey</persName>: Stated the group was grateful to be
                        asked to come to see the President and they all wanted to be candid, even
                        though most of them were sleepy as the result of the week's activities on
                        their respective campuses. He stated that the situation on campus this week
                        seems new, different, and terribly serious. The question has become whether
                        or not we can get through the week. He indicated that no longer are we
                        dealing with a small group of radicals, but rather a broad base of students
                        and faculty who are upset. Even the conservatives are filled with anxiety
                        and he feels that this new unrest springs from three things: <pb n="220"
                            xml:id="pg_220" facs="0240"/>

                            <item>Cambodia. He indicated that none of the men present were there to
                                pass judgment on Cambodia, but it does seem on campus to have been
                                the last straw. The students just don't see it the same way the
                                President must see it, but rather feel it is an expansion of the
                                war, or sort of a “here we go again.”</item>

                                feel that the Vice President does not understand the campus
                                community. He apparently doesn't understand or believe in the
                                freedom of speech and right of dissent.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Pusey feels the next three days may see a “terrible thing.” He noted that
                        students and faculty are now convening numerous meetings, turning away from
                        their academic duties, and a feeling that they want to declare war is
                        increasing.</p>
                    <p>Pusey stated that he feels we (the college presidents) must speak to the
                        academic community. He indicated the group feels that if the President could
                        find a man (for instance, a university president or even a Senator) who
                        would represent a rallying point for the President it would be very helpful.
                        Such a man should know and appreciate college institutions and be presented
                        as a channel of communication to the President. Perhaps he could be placed
                        temporarily on the White House staff for a month and even have a student
                        assistant.</p>
                    <p>Allen Wallis: Noted that he was very surprised to learn that the President
                        had been surprised regarding what the Kent State students had said. He
                        further noted that he continues to be surprised that the White House staff
                        is always surprised to learn what is going on. Finally, he was even more
                        surprised that the President would raise the long range question of campus
                        disturbance, which seemed to him analogous to discussing future insurance
                        policies while your building was ablaze. He wonders whether these
                        institutions will even hold together 'til Monday without more people getting
                        killed. Up until now we were gaining a coalescence of people against
                        violence who were willing to work in such things as Congressional elections
                        and were opposing student occupation of buildings, but that may be lost.</p>
                    <p>Fred Harrington: Stated that Wisconsin does not share the same concern about
                        the national guard that Kent State does, but at Wisconsin the university is
                        in control over the national guard when they move onto campus. He expressed
                        great concern that the moderates are going over to join the radicals.</p>
                    <p>William Friday: Noted that students and faculty are now beginning to hire
                        busses to come to Washington next week to talk to Congressmen, not the
                        President, about Cambodia and Viet Nam. He stated that there <pb n="221"
                            xml:id="pg_221" facs="0241"/>is a real need to stabilize this situation
                        and felt the President is the only person who can do this.</p>
                    <p>The President: Inquired whether appointing a man to be a listener isn't
                        somewhat like appointing a commission. Wouldn't it indicate that we are just
                        trying to push the students off? He further asked if this wouldn't look like
                        a scholar in residence?</p>
                    <p>(The group generally felt that such an appointment would be very helpful and
                        would not be analogous to appointing a commission.)</p>
                    <p>Malcolm Moos: Felt that any repressive moves would be bad. He categorically
                        stated that the Vice President must be muzzled. When the Vice President
                        attacked the president of the University of Michigan, things exploded beyond
                        control. Stated that the President must let the country know that this is
                        not what he (the President) believes. Asked whether the Vice President was
                        going to make the speech at Stone Mountain.</p>
                    <p>The President: Replied that he was, and indicated that these men should not
                        worry about the speech, since he (the President) wrote the Vice President's
                        speech himself. The President indicated that it would be a good speech and
                        that it would say the right things.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Moos</persName> further indicated that the students are now
                        going to the Congressmen and not to the President.</p>
                    <p>Malcolm Levi: Stated that the President must give the impression that he
                        cares and is willing to talk to people. He noted that those who want
                        violence may now have the ability to take over. Stated that he feels the
                        President has been isolating himself and should come out now and say that he
                        welcomes student views. Naturally, one cannot open up this solicitation of
                        student views to questions of whether or not students should be running the
                        universities, making the decisions in Cambodia, or anything like that.</p>
                    <p>The President: Noted that he was having a press conference on Friday and
                        pointed out to the group that it was he who had arranged for the
                        administration to communicate with people such as Sam Brown during the
                        moratoriums. Naturally, decisions such as Cambodia cannot be made based upon
                        how many people come in and out of the White House.</p>
                    <p>Levi: Stated that he felt it was unfortunate that the President had gone to
                        the Pentagon after the Cambodia speech, which made the whole thing seem
                        quite military.</p>
                    <p>The President: Stated that we're not going to fight in Cambodia or Laos, and
                        that this summer should well bring the best news out of the Viet Nam
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Alexander Heard: Said that the message he brought was one of attitude being
                        communicated. Feels the students believe that it's their lives <pb n="222"
                            xml:id="pg_222" facs="0242"/>that are at issue and we are facing a
                        fundamental crisis in our political system. The moderate students are
                        saying, “Here we are, working away, wanting to change the system in an
                        orderly fashion (such as by protest or demonstration) and yet we are derided
                        and condemned and our motives impugned by the Vice President and the
                        Attorney General, who lump us together with those who would burn
                        buildings.</p>
                    <p>He further stated that somehow the President should convey a feeling of
                        sympathy and understanding to those willing to work in outspoken ways short
                        of violence. The students are asking, “Where do I go now, if I'm condemned
                        when I work within the framework of the system?” Feels that the students
                        must sense a warmth and receptivity from the administration or they will
                        join the other side.</p>
                    <p>Moos then stated that the universities are being separated from the nation
                        and that perhaps this group could meet with the President from time to time
                        to keep some visibility.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Pusey</persName> indicated that they would like to hold a press
                        conference this afternoon and indicate that they had been here, stated their
                        views, and found the President concerned and receptive.</p>
                    <p>The President said that they should naturally meet with the press and he
                        certainly wouldn't tell them what to say. The President went on to say that
                        no one believes more strongly in the right to dissent than he does, short,
                        of course, of the right to violence.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Stated that we are
                        listening and certainly have compassion with their anguish.</p>
                    <p>The President said the issue is the means.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that we get only
                        one guess when we take such actions as Cambodia, and we must often act on
                        things we cannot always prove.</p>
                    <p>A short discussion followed regarding who such a man might be, if the
                        President appointed one as a “listening post.” Those mentioned were Roben W.
                        Fleming, President of the University of Michigan, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">Charles</persName> Young of the University of
                        California at Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>Pusey noted that the black issue is still smoldering and should not go
                        unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>Wallis came down rather hard on the Vice President, noting that the Vice
                        President had attacked Cornell when he didn't even have the facts straight
                        and really meant Connecticut. He stated he feels the Vice President is
                        somewhat like McCarthy, who goes around hitting individuals who can't defend
                        themselves or possibly recover. He noted that in many cases he agreed with
                        the Vice President regarding the merits of what he is saying, but he
                        nonetheless feels somewhat outraged that the Vice President would attack
                        persons individually and name them. Even <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223"
                            facs="0243"/>if what he's saying makes sense, does he consider what
                        effect it's having?</p>
                    <p>The President stated that of course one must assume the responsibility for
                        any remarks he's made, even if they are taken out of context.</p>
                    <p>There was some final discussion regarding the selection of a man to work at
                        the White House for the President. Some suggested possibly Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> or Secretary Finch. Mr.
                            <persName>Levi</persName> felt that it should not be someone from within
                        the administration.</p>
                    <p>The President noted all this, but did not commit to appointing someone.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>. Mr. President, one of the
                        things that happened in the Senate last week was the rescinding of the Gulf
                        of Tonkin resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">On August 7, 1964, Congress
                            responded to a North Vietnamese attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
                            Tonkin by passing a joint resolution expressing Congressional approval
                            and support of the “determination of the President, as Commander in
                            Chief, to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against
                            the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.” On
                            August 10 President Johnson signed the joint resolution into law as
                            Public Law 88-408. (78 Stat. 384)</note> by the Senate. Mr.
                            <persName>Katzenbach</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Nicholas
                            deB. Katzenbach, Under Secretary of State from 1966 to 1968. [Footnote
                            in the source text.]</note> in the previous administration, told the
                        Foreign Relations Committee that resolution was tantamount to a
                        congressional declaration of war. If it is rescinded, what legal
                        justification do you have for continuing to fight a war that is undeclared
                        in Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>The President. First, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>, as
                        you know, this war, while it was undeclared, was here when I became
                        President of the United States. I do <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0244"
                        />not say that critically. I am simply stating the fact that there were
                        549,000 Americans in Vietnam under attack when I became President.</p>
                    <p>The President of the United States has the constitutional right—not only the
                        right, but the responsibility—to use his powers to protect American forces
                        when they are engaged in military actions, and under these circumstances,
                        starting at the time that I became President, I have that power and I am
                        exercising that power.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>. Sir, I am not recommending
                        this, but if you don't have a legal authority to wage a war, then presumably
                        you could move troops out. It would be possible to agree with the North
                        Vietnamese. They would be delighted to have us surrender. So that you
                        could—</p>
                    <p>What justification do you have for keeping troops there other than protecting
                        the troops that are there fighting?</p>
                    <p>The President. A very significant justification. It isn't just a case of
                        seeing that the Americans are moved out in an orderly way. If that were the
                        case, we could move them out more quickly, but it is a case of moving
                        American forces out in a way that we can at the same time win a just
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Now, by winning a just peace, what I mean is not victory over North
                        Vietnam—we are not asking for that—but it is simply the right of the people
                        of South Vietnam to determine their own future without having us impose our
                        will upon them, or the North Vietnamese, or anybody else outside impose
                        their will upon them.</p>
                    <p>When we look at that limited objective, I am sure some would say, “Well, is
                        that really worth it? Is that worth the efforts of all these Americans
                        fighting in Vietnam, the lives that have been lost”?</p>
                    <p>I suppose it could be said that simply saving 17 million people in South
                        Vietnam from a Communist takeover isn't worth the efforts of the United
                        States. But let's go further. If the United States, after all of this
                        effort, if we were to withdraw immediately, as many Americans would want us
                        to do—and it would be very easy for me to do it and simply blame it on the
                        previous administration—but if we were to do that, I would probably survive
                        through my term, but it would have, in my view, a catastrophic effect on
                        this country and the cause of peace in the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>Now I know there are those who say the domino theory is obsolete. They
                        haven't talked to the dominoes. They should talk to the Thais, to the
                        Malaysians, to the Singaporans, to the Indonesians, to the Filipinos, to the
                        Japanese, and the rest. And if the United States leaves Vietnam in a way
                        that we are humiliated or defeated, not simply speaking in what is called
                        jingoistic terms, but in very practical terms, this will be immensely
                        discouraging to the 300 million people from Japan clear around to Thailand
                        in free Asia; and even more important it will be <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225"
                            facs="0245"/>ominously encouraging to the leaders of Communist China and
                        the Soviet Union who are supporting the North Vietnamese. It will encourage
                        them in their expansionist policies in other areas.</p>
                    <p>The world will be much safer in which to live.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>. I happen to be one of those
                        who agrees with what you are saying, but do you have a legal justification
                        to follow that policy once the Tonkin Gulf Resolution is dead?</p>
                    <p>The President. Yes, sir, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>,
                        the legal justification is the one that I have given, and that is the right
                        of the President of the United States under the Constitution to protect the
                        lives of American men. That is the legal justification. You may recall, of
                        course, that we went through this same debate at the time of Korea. Korea
                        was also an undeclared war, and then, of course, we justified it on the
                        basis of a U.N. action. I believe we have a legal justification and I intend
                        to use it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Sevareid</persName>. Mr. President, you have said that
                        self-determination in South Vietnam is really our aim and all we can ask
                        for. The Vice President says a non-Communist future for Indochina, or
                        Southeast Asia. His statement seems to enlarge the ultimate American aim
                        considerably. Have we misunderstood you or has he or what is the aim?</p>
                    <p>Mr. President. Mr. <persName>Sevareid</persName>, when the Vice President
                        refers to a non-Communist Southeast Asia that would mean of course, a
                        non-Communist South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
                        and Indonesia. That is the area we usually think of as Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>This is certainly something that I think most Americans and most of those in
                        free Asia and most of those in the free world would think would be a
                        desirable goal.</p>
                    <p>Let me put it another way: I do not think it would be in the interest of the
                        United States and those who want peace in the Pacific if that part of the
                        world should become Communist, because then the peace of the world, the
                        peace in the Pacific, would be in my opinion very greatly jeopardized if the
                        Communists were to go through that area.</p>
                    <p>However, referring now specifically to what we are doing in Vietnam, our aim
                        there is a very limited one, and it is to provide for the South Vietnamese
                        the right of self-determination. I believe that when they exercise that
                        right they will choose a non-Communist government. But we are indicating—and
                        incidentally, despite what everybody says about the present government in
                        South Vietnam, its inadequacies and the rest, we have to give them credit
                        for the fact that they also have indicated that they will accept the result
                        of an election, what the people choose.</p>
                    <p>Let us note the fact that the North Vietnamese are in power not as a result
                        of an election, and have refused to indicate that they will accept <pb
                            n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0246"/>the result of an election in South
                        Vietnam, which would seem to me to be a pretty good bargaining point on our
                        side.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor. Mr. President, I am a little confused at this point because
                        you seem in vivid terms to be describing South Vietnam as the first of the
                        string of dominoes that could topple in that part of the world and turn it
                        into a Communist part of the world, in simple terms.</p>
                    <p>Are you saying that we cannot survive, we cannot allow a regime or a
                        government in South Vietnam to be constructed that would, say, lean toward
                        the Communist bloc? What about a sort of Yugoslavia? Is there any
                        possibility of that kind of settlement?</p>
                    <p>The President. Mr. Chancellor, it depends upon the people of South Vietnam.
                        If the people of South Vietnam after they see what the Vietcong, the
                        Communist Vietcong, have done to the villages they have occupied, the 40,000
                        people that they have murdered, village chiefs and others, the atrocities of
                        Hue—if the people of South Vietnam, of which 850,000 of them are Catholic
                        refugees from North Vietnam, after a blood bath there when the North
                        Vietnamese took over in North Vietnam—if the people of South Vietnam under
                        those circumstances should choose to move in the direction of a Communist
                        government, that, of course, is their right. I do not think it will happen.
                        But I do emphasize that the American position and the position also of the
                        present Government of South Vietnam, it seems to me, are especially strong,
                        because we are confident enough that we say to the enemy, “All right, we'll
                        put our case to the people and we'll accept the result.” If it happens to be
                        what you describe, a Yugoslav type of government or a mixed government, we
                        will accept it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor. What I am getting at, sir, is, if you say on the one hand
                        that Vietnam—South Vietnam—is the first of the row of dominoes which we
                        cannot allow to topple, then can you say equally, at the same time, that we
                        will accept the judgment of the people of South Vietnam if they choose a
                        Communist government?</p>
                    <p>The President. The point that you make, Mr. Chancellor, is one that we in the
                        free world face every place in the world, and it is really what
                        distinguishes us from the Communist world.</p>
                    <p>Again, I know that what is called cold war rhetoric isn't fashionable these
                        days, and I am not engaging in it because I am quite practical, and we must
                        be quite practical, about the world in which we live with all the dangers
                        that we have in the Mideast and other areas that I am sure we will be
                        discussing later in this program.</p>
                    <p>But let us understand that we in the free world have to live or die by the
                        proposition that the people have a right to choose.</p>
                    <p>Let it also be noted that in no country in the world today in which the
                        Communists are in power have they come to power as a result of the <pb
                            n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0247"/>people choosing them—not in North
                        Vietnam, not in North Korea, not in China, not in Russia, and not in any one
                        of the countries of Eastern Europe, and not in Cuba. In every case,
                        communism has come to power by other than a free election, so I think we are
                        in a pretty safe position on this particular point.</p>
                    <p>I think you are therefore putting, and I don't say this critically, what is
                        really a hypothetical question. It could happen. But if it does happen that
                        way we must assume the consequences, and if the people of South Vietnam
                        should choose a Communist government, then we will have to accept the
                        consequences of what would happen as far as the domino theory in the other
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chancellor. In other words, live with it?</p>
                    <p>The President. We would have to live with it, and I would also suggest this:
                        When we talk about the dominoes, I am not saying that automatically if South
                        Vietnam should go the others topple one by one. I am only saying that in
                        talking to every one of the Asian leaders, and I have talked to all of them.
                        I have talked to Lee Kuan Yew—all of you know him from Singapore of
                        course—and to the Tunku<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">A Malaysian title meaning
                            Prince or My <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>; Tunku Rahman

                        Malaysia, the little countries, and to Suharto from Indonesia, and of course
                        to Thanom and Thanat Khoman, the two major leaders in Thailand—I have talked
                        to all of these leaders and every one of them to a man recognizes, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> of Japan recognizes, and of
                        course the Koreans recognize that if the Communists succeed, not as a result
                        of a free election—they are not thinking of that—but if they succeed as a
                        result of exporting aggression and supporting it in toppling the government,
                        then the message to them is, “Watch out, we might be next.”</p>
                    <p>That's what is real. So, if they come in as a result of a free election, and
                        I don't think that is going to happen, the domino effect would not be as
                        great.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President's introductory remarks and his responses to
                        questions dealing with the Middle East, Vietnam and the Paris peace talks,
                        arms control negotiations, price trends, and school desegregation.]</p>
                    <p>Q. To pursue the question of our military preparedness a bit further, twice
                        within the past week statements have been made by high ranking naval
                        officers, Admiral Rickover and Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, to the effect that
                        our military preparedness is suspect. And they went further. Each gentleman
                        said that in his opinion it is doubtful that we could win a war with the
                        Soviet Union. Given the eminence of these gentlemen, as Commander in Chief,
                        how do you regard the validity of those statements?</p>
                    <p>The President. Well, I would first react by saying that if there is a war
                        between the Soviet Union and the United States, there will be no winners,
                        there will be only losers. The Soviet Union knows this and we know that.</p>
                    <p>That is the reason why it is vitally important that in areas like the Mideast
                        that we attempt to avoid to the greatest extent possible being dragged into
                        a confrontation by smaller powers, even though our interests in the area are
                        very, very great. That is why it is very much in our interests in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks to work out an arrangement if we
                        can, one which will provide for the interests of both and yet not be in
                        derogation of the necessity of our having sufficiency and their having
                        sufficiency.</p>
                    <p>One other point I would make briefly is this: What the Soviet Union needs in
                        terms of military preparedness is different from what we need. They are a
                        land power primarily, with a great potential enemy on the east. We are
                        primarily, of course, a sea power and our needs, therefore, are different.
                        But what is important now is to find a way to stop this escalation of arms
                        on both sides, and that is why we have hopes in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> talks which, I emphasize again, do not involve disarmament
                        for the United States or the Soviet Union, but do involve a limitation and
                        then eventually a mutual reduction.</p>

                    <p>I will talk to you for a bit about our general approach to foreign policy,
                        and specifically also about the disarmament talks, relations with the
                        Soviets and Vietnam, maybe a word about the Middle East. Then Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> can talk to you in somewhat
                        greater detail about the specifics of recent events in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin with a general statement first. I believe that when the history
                        of American post-war foreign policy is written, it will turn out that the
                        big turning point occurred not in 1961 when it was very eloquently
                        announced, but in 1969, when no claims were made.</p>
                    <p>At the end of April of this year when the President spoke about Cambodia,
                        many of my colleagues complained bitterly—many of my ex-colleagues
                        complained bitterly—about the polarizing effect that his speech was supposed
                        to have had with its emphasis on commitments to friends abroad and the
                        desire to see to it that the self-determination of South Vietnam be
                        preserved.</p>
                    <p>But if you read, for example, the Inaugural Address of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>, you will find such phrases—I don't
                        have the exact text here but I think this is reasonably accurate—as: “We
                        will pay any price, we will bear any burden, we will meet any hardship, we
                        will fight any enemy, we will support any friend, to assure the survival of
                        liberty.”</p>
                    <p>I am not saying this as a criticism. It moved me, too, very much. I am citing
                        it as an example of the enormous transformation that has taken place in the
                        situation in the world and in the situation in America since the early
                        60's.</p>
                    <p>The period of the 60's, in retrospect, will probably appear as the last
                        flowering of that era of American foreign policy which we initiated in 1948,
                        when we threw ourselves into international affairs with the same enthusiasm,
                        impetuosity, and dedication with which we had built our country.</p>
                    <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0250"/>
                    <p>The belief was after our long history of isolation that any problem in the
                        world that was not solved by America would probably not be solved at all.
                        All over the world the United States found itself in the position of
                        designing all the programs, selling them, executing them, running them. Part
                        of this reflected the realities of the postwar situation.</p>
                    <p>Every major country in Europe, except Great Britain, had been defeated at one
                        stage or another during the war.</p>
                    <p>Every country in Europe, with the exception of Great Britain, had been
                        occupied at one stage or another during the war.</p>
                    <p>Every country in the world that had ever played a major role in foreign
                        policy had been significantly smashed or reduced in influence, power and
                        capacity to conduct foreign affairs, by the war. Economies were shattered.
                        Civil government was very often threatened by domestic discord.</p>
                    <p>In these conditions, it was, in fact, true that if the United States did not
                        play the major role, no one else possibly could.</p>
                    <p>Many of the transformations that I am talking about, therefore, are not
                        criticisms of previous Administrations. They were made possible or, indeed,
                        necessary, by the successes of previous policy and not always by the
                        failures—although some of them also reflect certain failure.</p>
                    <p>A number of big changes have occurred. First, since 1948 over sixty new
                        states have come into being. Since 1948 many of the traditional countries of
                        Europe and Asia regained a great deal of their strength and vigor. Since
                        1948, the Communist world, which appeared monolithic, has appeared to have
                        many profound divisions. And since 1948, and especially through the 1960's,
                        we have had to learn that the United States cannot be in the position where
                        other countries can pretend that their development is more important to us
                        than it is to them, and that if their security is threatened, it is worse
                        for us than it is for them. The United States cannot be in this position
                        because to conduct foreign policy on this basis may be beyond our physical
                        resources. It surely is beyond our psychological resources. No one can ask
                        the U.S. Government to take the principal responsibility for every decision
                        at every point in the world at every moment in time. It is not healthy for
                        us and it is not healthy for other countries. It enables them to shift the
                        burden of difficult decisions to the United States. It demoralizes their
                        domestic situation. It exacerbates our domestic decisions when all the
                        burdens have to be borne by the United States at every point throughout the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>It was in this situation, in the fifth year of a war that seemed
                        inconclusive, that this administration has come into office. It is in these
                        conditions that we have tried to adjust the American foreign policy to
                        realities of both our domestic and our foreign situation.</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0251"/>
                    <p>I read in the newspapers always very exciting accounts of the tremendous
                        disputes that go on within the Administration, and who is up and who is down
                        at any particular point, and who did or did not know about this or that
                        decision. The basic charge that the President has given me and to his senior
                        advisors is, first of all, to ask ourselves where we are going. The
                        President, on the whole, is not interested in tactical questions. I remember
                        four weeks after we came into office, if I can mention a personal vignette,
                        the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese started an offensive. The government
                        was then still geared to the pace of the previous administration. A number
                        of senior officials wanted to come over and assemble in the Situation Room
                        so that the President could conduct that battle. I told them to wait a
                        minute and let me find out what the President wanted to do. I asked the
                        President whether he wanted to conduct these tactical operations from the
                        White House. He said, “Is there any decision that I need to make?” I said
                        no. He said, “Is there any decision that I can make now that would make any
                        difference?” I said no. Then he said, “I don't want to see them. When there
                        is a decision that I need to make, let me know. Let me know what my choices
                        are.” He was absolutely right. There was nothing he could do at that point
                        when the attack started that would not drive everybody crazy. The important
                        concern that the President has put before us is to know where we are going,
                        to put before him the fullest range of choices that he can develop; and
                        then, of course, the final decision, which of the options he would choose,
                        is up to him. He has steadfastly refused to leap on the basis of what seems
                        temporarily fashionable.</p>
                    <p>This has been terribly important because, as a result of the frustration of
                        some of the previous events, and partly as a result of the fact that we had,
                        or maybe have, outrun our intellectual capacity in some areas, there has
                        been a tendency to have a rote answer to every question. The President
                        mentioned the issue of disarmament. When we came into office, we were
                        confronted with the prospect of talks on strategic arms limitations with the
                        Soviets. We received a great deal of vociferous pressure from many
                        well-meaning groups that we should immediately plunge into these
                        negotiations. We hesitated. Indeed, we did not do it. We did not [<hi
                            rend="italic">sic</hi>]hesitate, but we did not do it because we did not
                        want to engage in negotiations on a subject of this magnitude until we knew
                        what we were talking about.</p>
                    <p>The danger of going into these negotiations precipitately was that we would
                        spend two-thirds of the time negotiating with ourselves and one-third of the
                        time negotiating with the Soviets. If you look at the history of the nuclear
                        ban, for example, we spent five years on that subject. On the
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty, which didn't even concern us, primarily, but other
                        countries, we spent four years.</p>
                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>It would have been an easy matter to slap together a position and meet the
                        Russians and put our position on the table. Then the Soviets would put their
                        position on the table. There would have been a deadlock. We would have had
                        to renegotiate our position within our bureaucracy. We would go back to the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>This process could have been repeated indefinitely for five or six years.
                        Instead, the President ordered the fullest study that has been made in or
                        outside the government of just exactly what one would do if one wanted to
                        limit any conceivable weapon system that has any conceivable application for
                        strategic warfare.</p>
                    <p>We went through this weapon system by weapon system. We analyzed what our
                        means of inspection were, what the dangers of violation were, what we would
                        do if we spotted a violation, what the strategic significance would be if
                        there was an agreement or if there were not an agreement.</p>
                    <p>In that process, incidentally, most of the usual bureaucratic disputes were
                        avoided because we looked at it as an analytical problem and not as a
                        bureaucratic problem.</p>
                    <p>Having made this survey, we were then in a position to put together four
                        positions of various degrees of comprehensives, of which the President chose
                        the two most comprehensive ones, which we put to the Soviets. The Soviets,
                        as was predictable—and this I am not saying critically, the issue is so
                        complex—had a slightly different view of the problem. But the work we had
                        done enabled us to shift within a matter of three weeks from one position to
                        another where previously this would have taken a year of internal fighting
                        within our Administration.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we are extremely optimistic about the progress in strategic arms
                        talks. The Soviets have been constructive and without their cooperation it
                        wouldn't have been possible. But I think it is fair to say that without the
                        particular approach that the President insisted we introduce into the
                        decision-making process, we could not have gotten to where we are today.</p>
                    <p>I will come back to that in a moment. I wanted to use it only as an
                        illustration of the general approach.</p>
                    <p>Let me go back, then, and say that in the light of the philosophy I have
                        described, and say what the guiding principle of the Administration is with
                        respect to foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>This was expressed by the President at Guam, and has been popularly described
                        as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. It states the
                        following: One, of course, we will maintain any commitments that the United
                        States has. Two, that in the case of a threat by a nuclear country against a
                        non-nuclear country, we feel that we have a special obligation since we are
                        the only major nuclear country in the free world. Three, with respect to <pb
                            n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0253"/>other threats, or with respect to
                        other programs, the initial and principal responsibility has to be borne
                        first by the country concerned and secondly by the region concerned.</p>
                    <p>We will assist where our interests are involved and where what we can do can
                        make a difference. But we will not be in a position where the principal
                        programs or the principal defense are borne in the first instance by the
                        United States if the countries concerned do not make the effort
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>This we view not as a way of withdrawing from the world, but as a way of
                        remaining related to the world in a way that is historically,
                        psychologically and domestically bearable for us. It is a way of shifting to
                        the other countries what has to be the normal position of the primary burden
                        of their responsibilities, intellectually, physically, politically and
                        militarily.</p>
                    <p>Enunciating a doctrine is a lot easier than implementing it. Obviously, as
                        one goes into a new phase, it is only at universities that one has sharp
                        dividing lines. In reality, there are always vestiges of the old together
                        with the beginning of the new. Obviously, for example, when you have 550,000
                        Americans engaged in combat, you cannot shift to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine the day after you have
                        announced it. That will have to be obviously, in those areas, a gradual
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>So, I am describing a direction and not a cookbook, a recipe, that can be
                        applied literally to every situation from one day to the next.</p>
                    <p>The reason why we believe that this doctrine can, should and will
                        characterize American foreign policy in the next decade is not only because
                        of the developing strength and self-confidence of other countries, but also
                        because of the different conditions that exist in the world compared to the
                        late 1940's.</p>
                    <p>In the late 1940's and the 50's, and, indeed, the early 60's, one thought of
                        Communism as a monolith, inherently and eternally aggressive and run from a
                        central core. No one who has seen the Communist world operate would
                        underrate the aggressiveness of many of their leaders and many of their
                        countries. But there has been an important historical change in a number of
                        respects.</p>
                    <p>One is that the Communist system simply isn't working very well domestically,
                        and that the Communist Party really does not have a very meaningful domestic
                        function any more.</p>
                    <p>This has good and bad consequences. It leads on the one hand to a certain
                        bureaucratization of life. On the other hand, it may give the Communist
                        Parties a vested interest in foreign dangers. You don't need an ideological
                        party to run a country. You don't need them to run an economy. So, they may
                        have a vested interest always in being in a position of some tension in at
                        least some part of the world.</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0254"/>
                    <p>The second important and perhaps decisive feature is the split between the
                        Soviet Union and Communist China. According to Communist doctrine, the
                        spread of Communism is to insure eternal peace. The fact of the matter is
                        that the Red Army has been used four times since World War II, always
                        against allies, only against allies.</p>
                    <p>The fact of the matter is that the deepest rivalries that exist in the world
                        today are between Communist countries. First, the split that existed between
                        the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and now the enormous tension that exists
                        between the Soviet Union and Communist China, which may be the deepest
                        factor in Soviet foreign policy and for which they really have no mechanism
                        of handling it. It would be bad enough as a problem among states, that is,
                        if states of the size of Communist China and the Soviet Union were in
                        conflict that would be serious enough, but when you add to it a
                        quasi-religious struggle of who is going to define the true orthodoxy so
                        that it has profound ideological, semi-religious overtones, it has many
                        insoluble aspects. And if the Soviet Union is more conciliatory towards the
                        West at the moment, the consciousness of what seems to them the impending
                        danger from the East is one of the most crucial factors.</p>
                    <p>There are, therefore, openings in negotiations with the Soviet Union that
                        simply did not exist even ten years ago, much less 20 years ago, produced by
                        this new aspect of international relations. These are the basic realities
                        with which we deal.</p>
                    <p>Let me now make a few remarks about some specifics in the conduct of foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>We have a difficult problem in the sense that when the President came into
                        office he announced that it would be an era of negotiations, that he was
                        aiming for an era of negotiation and not confrontation. Many Americans tend
                        to believe that you fuel negotiations primarily by endless demonstrations of
                        unilateral good will.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, history tends to indicate that negotiations depend to an
                        important extent, especially with Communist countries, on the balance of
                        risks and opportunities that they perceive.</p>
                    <p>Last year, when the President announced the <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                            >ABM</gloss> program, there were many who argued with us and said that
                        if we developed the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, this would spark a
                        new round of the arms race and it would forever doom the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The fact of the matter is, as the President pointed out, and as we can easily
                        demonstrate, that without the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> there
                        probably wouldn't be any meaningful <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                        negotiations. What possible incentive would the Soviets have? We have
                        stopped developing offensive weapons. We have stopped building offensive
                        weapons. Why should they make an agreement with us to stop doing something
                        that we have already stopped doing and that they are continuing to do.</p>
                    <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0255"/>
                    <p>We didn't say that last year. At that time, we did it mostly on strategic
                        claims, so I don't want to claim a foresight that we didn't insist on last
                        year. Last year we did it because we were getting worried about the
                        tremendous build up of the Soviet land based missile force.</p>
                    <p>As it turned out in the evolution of the negotiations, it is the <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> which is one of the main reasons why we can
                        be so optimistic about the fact that we will get a fairly comprehensive
                        agreement that we expect will include both offensive and defensive weapons
                        within a reasonable time period, certainly a much shorter time period than
                        was spent on any other set of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The second area which I will not cover in detail, but which Joe Sisco will
                        talk about is, of course, the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>I will confine myself to this general set of remarks. In many respects, the
                        Middle East is a more difficult and in some of its aspects a more dangerous
                        problem than, say, Southeast Asia. It is more difficult and more dangerous
                        because we and the other side are not so completely in control of our
                        actions. The characteristic of the Middle East that has caused the President
                        and others to describe it as similar to the Balkans before World War I is
                        that you have two groups of countries with very intense emotions who are
                        very conscious of their local rivalries, but not primarily responsible for
                        the peace of the world, two groups of countries that are, however, tied to
                        the two opposing major camps, so that if these countries can get into
                        conflict without the desire of the major countries, that is, specifically if
                        there is an Arab-Israeli war that is not caused either by a decision in
                        Washington or a decision in Moscow, it can nevertheless happen that
                        Washington and Moscow, or the United States and the Soviet Union may get
                        involved despite the fact that they were not involved in the initial
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>This is why the Administration has been so interested in bringing about a
                        settlement in the Middle East, and why <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe
                            Sisco</persName> has been so invaluable in coming up with a formula. I
                        will not say anything more about it except to underline our concern about
                        the Middle East, the fact that the Administration has had a united policy on
                        that issue, and that we consider it one of our high priority items.</p>
                    <p>Now let me make a few remarks about Southeast Asia. If the Middle East is our
                        most dangerous area, there is no doubt that Southeast Asia is our most
                        anguishing problem. We came into office while the level of troops was, in
                        fact, still increasing in Vietnam, in the fifth year of a war that had been
                        inconclusive, in negotiations which had never yet reached substance, and we
                        faced the problem of bringing the war to a conclusion as the President
                        promised, and in conformity with the principles that he has himself outlined
                        to you.</p>
                    <p>There is a liturgical quality about the Vietnam debate that causes the

                        />positions, that causes people to take fixed positions, and makes it very
                        difficult to have a meaningful debate. I recognize that the concerns that
                        have been expressed by many of our critics are based on very thoughtful
                        analysis. Let me therefore state briefly where we think we are going, and
                        why we do what we are doing.</p>
                    <p>First of all, the other day I met with a group of Princeton students whose
                        emotions exceeded their knowledge, and who said, Why are you simply
                        continuing old policies? Why don't you have the courage to change the
                        policy? I reminded them that in August 1968, Senator <persName>Edward
                            Kennedy</persName> made a speech in which he said he was picking up the
                        fallen banner of his brother as a declaration of conscience of what should
                        be done in Vietnam. I asked them to read that speech because it turns out
                        there is nothing in that speech that we have not already done and exceeded.
                        So what the professors of 1968 considered a daring program, we have gone far
                        beyond. In 1968 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]when we came in, the number of
                        troops was still increasing.</p>
                    <p>We have announced withdrawals of over 260,000. In 1968 the issue of whether
                        one would even talk to the National Liberation Front was not settled. There
                        is no question now that they can participate in the political process of
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I don't want to repeat all the details which we can furnish you in writing.
                        The major point I want to make is that this Administration is committed to
                        ending the war, and it will end the war. But in order to end the war, it
                        must carry out a number of steps which lend themselves to relatively easy
                        attack. Obviously, at this stage of the war, there are no brilliant
                        solutions available. The easy things have all been done. Therefore, anyone
                        who takes the negative of any proposition can point out many weaknesses in
                        any course that may be pursued.</p>
                    <p>Let me give you an example. One of our basic policies is the policy of
                        Vietnamization, which is really an application of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine to South Vietnam, in which
                        we want to put more and more responsibility on the South Vietnamese for
                        their defense and for their political development.</p>
                    <p>There are many people who specialize in pointing out that this cannot
                        possibly work, and others who say, “You mustn't have Vietnamization; you
                        should have negotiation.”</p>
                    <p>Let me say two things about it. First, if Vietnamization doesn't work,
                        negotiation will not work either. Let me say flatly the whole thrust of our
                        policy is to promote negotiation. We are convinced that the only quick way
                        to end the war is through negotiation. The only reliable way of ending the
                        war is through negotiation. No one familiar with the history of Vietnam can
                        have any doubt that any program that depends entirely on local conditions
                        has major problems connected with it.</p>
                    <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0257"/>
                    <p>But what we are saying is this: To the extent that the North Vietnamese look
                        at the situation in South Vietnam and see that there develops there a
                        structure that at least will give them a major problem after we withdraw, to
                        that extent they will have an incentive to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>To the extent that the North Vietnamese looking at South Vietnam see a
                        structure that is certain to collapse, to that same extent negotiations
                        cannot work.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, there is no opposition between negotiation and Vietnamization. If
                        Vietnamization works, negotiation may work—will work. If Vietnamization
                        doesn't work, then both policies do not work.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, on the issue, there are many proposals, some of which have found
                        their way into editorial pages, to the effect that we should put a deadline
                        on our withdrawals. First of all, no one really knows whether we have an
                        internal deadline or not. Secondly, whether we should announce a deadline
                        raises a whole series of questions.</p>
                    <p>One reason we don't announce a deadline is because we want to beat any of the
                        deadlines that I have seen written about. The reason we think we want to
                        beat it is because we still have not given up on negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Once you have committed yourself irrevocably to getting out on a certain
                        date, regardless of consequences, the other side has no conceivable interest
                        left in negotiation. At that time, their only task is to hold on until that
                        deadline is reached.</p>
                    <p>We are reasonably optimistic, insofar as one can be that in Vietnam, that
                        Vietnamization is progressing satisfactorily enough, in order to support
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>We will have setbacks and there won't be an uninterrupted progress. But the
                        major trend we believe will either lead to a situation in which the other
                        side may negotiate or to a situation in which we can withdraw and leave the
                        country in a position where it has at least a chance to take care of
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>Let me mention a few questions that are always put to us. A friend of mine
                        wrote a letter a few months ago in which he said he wanted to put a few
                        questions that concerned thoughtful people. One of his questions was: To
                        what extent is your policy dictated by the Saigon Government? Or, are you
                        independent of the Saigon Government?</p>
                    <p>I know the fashionable thing, at least in my former stamping grounds, would
                        be to say we are completely independent of the Saigon Government and we do
                        exactly what we believe. That would be a demagogic thing to say.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, when you fight in another country, you are allied with that other
                        country, and you are affected by the actions of that country. Of course, we
                        are influenced by some of their views.</p>
                    <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0258"/>
                    <p>What we are trying to do, however, through the process of Vietnamization, is
                        to put them into a position, and ourselves in a position, where we are less
                        and less dependent on their actions and they are less and less dependent on
                        our views. That is the purpose of Vietnamization. We are not there yet, but
                        we are trying to be there.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, are we independent of Hanoi's action?</p>
                    <p>Of course we are not completely independent of Hanoi's action. They, to some
                        extent, influence us.</p>
                    <p>The third question is in negotiations, why don't you propose—and then you can
                        have any list that human ingenuity can devise.</p>
                    <p>Let me make one observation about negotiations. First, there is a myth that
                        negotiation with the North Vietnamese is like a detective story, in which
                        they throw out their clues and we have to guess at the answer. Then if we
                        don't get the answer correctly we are at fault for the failure of the
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>I have been visited by more self-appointed peace emissaries who have picked
                        out a phrase from some delegate in Paris that they thought was terribly
                        significant, that we had been told about already, 50 times before.</p>
                    <p>The chief problem in negotiations is not lack of ingenuity on our part in
                        coming up with a formula. The chief problem in negotiations is that we are
                        confronting a country that has fought for 25 years with great courage, but
                        whose very quality of courage may not make it capable of visualizing a
                        compromise.</p>
                    <p>We have paid for the beginning of negotiations five different times. First we
                        were told that if there were a bombing halt there would be substantive
                        negotiations. Then we were told if we talked to the <gloss target="#t_NLF1"
                            >NLF</gloss> there would be substantive negotiations; if we made a
                        symbolic withdrawal of troops, if we announced the withdrawal of 100,000
                        troops, if we made the withdrawal of 100,000 troops, if we announced a new
                        senior negotiator in Paris.</p>
                    <p>We have done every one of these things. There have not yet been substantive
                        negotiations, and that for one simple reason. The last convinced Leninists
                        in the world may be the North Vietnamese, and the sharing of political power
                        is not the most obvious conclusion to which you are driven by the study of
                        Leninism. Indeed, the opposite is true.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, Vietnamese, North or South, find it very difficult to visualize
                        anything else but total victory. As soon as North Vietnam indicates that it
                        is ready for serious negotiations, it will not be lack of ingenuity on our
                        part that will start the negotiating process. Of this I can assure you
                        flatly.</p>
                    <p>So, the missing ingredient at this moment is the beginning of a serious
                        negotiation. But we haven't given up hope. You read in the paper <pb n="239"
                            xml:id="pg_239" facs="0259"/>yesterday that their senior negotiator is
                        coming back to Paris. Whenever there has been a break in these Vietnam
                        negotiations, it has come suddenly. I am not saying it is coming now, but
                        whenever it will come, if it ever comes, it will be relatively sudden.</p>
                    <p>Let me make one final point to sum up all these observations. We had some
                        difficult months after the President's decision to go into Cambodia. We have
                        been told on a number of occasions how desirable it would be if we yielded
                        to the pressures of so many dedicated and concerned groups, and if we only
                        stopped what is often called the polarization of our society.</p>
                    <p>We have not done it, as the President said, because history tends to prove
                        that the people do not forgive leaders who produce disasters, even if these
                        disasters are following the recommendations made by the public. We believe
                        that our obligation is to make a peace that will last; that a peace cannot
                        last if in the process confidence in the United States is shaken.</p>
                    <p>Nor do we believe that the answer to our domestic difficulties is to yield to
                        any group that smashes the china and then says, “Look what you have made me
                        do.”</p>
                    <p>We believe it is important that the way we end the war and the way we build
                        the peace reflects the best judgment of the best thought that can be brought
                        to bear on the problem.</p>
                    <p>In doing this, we believe, even though this wouldn't be recognized, that we
                        may be the best protection of the very people who have been most
                        vociferously protesting against us. If this country is taken over by a
                        radical group, it will not be by upper middle class college kids. There will
                        be a much more elemental group taking it over.</p>
                    <p>We cannot permit the political contests to be fought out by rival groups of
                        demonstrators. We think this is terribly important, to conclude, because we
                        are at a point where except for the war in Vietnam, there are possibilities
                        of bringing about a more reliable peace in the world than we have known in
                        the whole post-war period.</p>
                    <p>We are at a point where we can re-define the American position with respect
                        to the world, where, for whatever reasons, it may be that even the Soviet
                        Union has come to a realization of the limitations of both its physical
                        strength and of the limits of its ideological fervor.</p>
                    <p>But none of these possibilities can be realized except by an American
                        Government that is confident that it knows what it is doing, that can
                        respond to its best judgment, and by an American public that has enough
                        confidence in its leaders so that they are permitted the modicum of
                        ambiguity that is sometimes inseparable from a situation in which you
                        cannot, at the beginning of a process, know completely what all the
                        consequences are.</p>
                    <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0260"/>
                    <p>The tragic aspect of policy-making is that when your scope for action is
                        greatest, the knowledge on which you can base this action is always at a
                        minimum. When your knowledge is greatest, the scope for action has often
                        disappeared. This is the problem that we face. This is why no society can
                        operate without confidence. But the reason despite this turmoil is because
                        in any new creation one is very conscious of the symptoms of the turmoil.
                        One is very aware of the things that are being changed. It is always a
                        painful process to see it come about. But we think there is a very good
                        chance that by the end of this term we will have laid the foundations for a
                        period to which many of those who were most worried a few months ago can not
                        only reconcile themselves, but can support and in which the whole American
                        public will feel that this was the beginning of an era of constructive
                        peace.</p>

                    <p>For more than two decades these programs have been guided by a vision of
                        international responsibilities conditioned by the aftermath of World War II
                        and the emergence of new nations. But the world has been changing
                        dramatically; by the end of the 'Sixties, there was widespread agreement
                        that our programs for foreign assistance had not kept up with these changes
                        and were losing their effectiveness. This sentiment has been reflected in
                        declining foreign aid levels.</p>
                    <p>The cause of this downward drift is not that the need for aid has diminished;
                            <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0261"/>nor is it that our capacity to
                        help other nations has diminished; nor has America lost her humanitarian
                        zeal; nor have we turned inward and abandoned our pursuit of peace and
                        freedom in the world.</p>
                    <p>The answer is not to stop foreign aid or to slash it further. The answer is
                        to reform our foreign assistance programs and do our share to meet the needs
                        of the 'Seventies.</p>
                    <p>A searching reexamination has clearly been in order and, as part of the new
                        Administration's review of policy, I was determined to undertake a fresh
                        appraisal. I have now completed that appraisal and in this message I am
                        proposing a set of fundamental and sweeping reforms to overhaul completely
                        our entire foreign assistance operation to make it fit a new foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>Such a major transformation cannot be accomplished overnight. The scope and
                        complexity of such an undertaking requires a deliberate and thoughtful
                        approach over many months. I look forward to active discussion of these
                        proposals with the Congress before I transmit my new assistance legislation
                        next year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Reform No. 1:</hi> I propose to create separate
                        organizational arrangements for each component of our assistance effort:
                        security assistance, humanitarian assistance, and development assistance.
                        This is necessary to enable us to fix responsibility more clearly, and to
                        assess the success of each program in achieving its specific objectives. My
                        proposal will overcome the confusion inherent in our present approach which
                        lumps together these separate objectives in composite programs.</p>

                        freshly conceived International Security Assistance Program. The prime
                        objective of this program will be to help other countries assume the
                        responsibility of their own defense and thus help us reduce our presence
                        abroad.</p>

                        the contribution to development of trade and private investment, and to
                        increase the effectiveness of government programs in promoting the

                                tariff preferences for the exports of manufactured products of the

                            <item>—I propose that all donor countries take steps to end the

                                produced in the nation providing the aid. Complete untying of aid is
                                a step that must be taken in concert with other nations; we have
                                already begun discussions with them toward that end. As an initial
                                step, I have directed that our own aid be immediately untied for
                                procurement in the lower income countries themselves.</item>

                        perspective, it is important to review here the way in which we have

                            <item>—As a foundation, we needed a foreign policy tailored to the
                                1970's to provide direction for our various programs. For that, we
                                developed and reported to the Congress in February the New Strategy

                                private U.S. citizens to make a completely independent assessment of
                                what we should be trying to achieve with our foreign aid programs
                                and how we should go about it.</item>

                    <p>The Task Force on International Development, chaired by <persName>Rudolph
                            Peterson</persName>, former President of the Bank of America, drew upon
                        the considerable experience of its own members and sought views from Members
                        of the Congress and from every quarter of U.S. society. In early March the
                        Task Force presented its report to me, and shortly thereafter I released it
                        to the public.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">See <ref target="#d53fn4">footnote

                        report provides the basis for the proposals which I am making today.</p>
                    <p>I also have taken into account the valuable insights and suggestions
                        concerning development problems which were contained in the Rockefeller

                                target="#d35fn5">footnote 5, Document 35</ref>.</note> Many of the
                        ideas and measures I am proposing in this message in fact were foreshadowed
                        by a number of policy changes and program innovations which I instituted in
                        our assistance programs in Latin America.</p>
                    <p rend="center">The Purposes of Foreign Assistance</p>
                    <p>There are three interrelated purposes that the U.S. should pursue through our
                        foreign assistance program: promoting our national security by supporting
                        the security of other nations; providing humanitarian relief; and furthering
                        the long-run economic and social development of the lower income
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>The national security objectives of the U.S. cannot be pursued solely through
                        defense of our territory. <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0264"/>They
                        require a successful effort by other countries around the world, including a
                        number of lower income countries, to mobilize manpower and resources to
                        defend themselves. They require in some cases, military bases abroad, to
                        give us the necessary mobility to defend ourselves and to deter aggression.
                        They sometimes require our financial support of friendly countries in
                        exceptional situations.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, our security assistance programs must be formulated to achieve the
                        objectives of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine,
                        which I set forth at Guam last year. That approach calls for any country
                        whose security is threatened to assume the primary responsibility for
                        providing the manpower needed for its own defense. Such reliance on local
                        initiative encourages local assumption of responsibility and thereby serves
                        both the needs of other countries and our own national interest. In
                        addition, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine calls
                        for our providing assistance to such countries to help them assume these
                        responsibilities more quickly and more effectively. The new International
                        Security Assistance Program will be devoted largely to these objectives. I
                        shall set forth the details of the proposed program when I transmit the
                        necessary implementing legislation to the Congress next year.</p>
                    <p>The humanitarian concerns of the American people have traditionally led us to
                        provide assistance to foreign countries for relief from natural disasters,
                        to help with child care and maternal welfare, and to respond to the needs of
                        international refugees and migrants. Our humanitarian assistance programs,
                        limited in size but substantial in human benefits, give meaningful
                        expression to these concerns.</p>
                    <p>Both security and humanitarian assistance serve our basic national goal: the
                        creation of a peaceful world. This interest is also served, in a fundamental
                        and lasting sense, by the third purpose of our foreign assistance: the
                        building of self-reliant and productive societies in the lower income
                        countries. Because these countries contain two-thirds of the world's
                        population, the direction which the development of their societies takes
                        will profoundly affect the world in which we live.</p>
                    <p>We must respond to the needs of these countries if our own country and its
                        values are to remain secure. We are, of course, wholly responsible for
                        solutions to our problems at home, and we can contribute only partially to
                        solutions abroad. But foreign aid must be seen for what it is—not a burden,
                        but an opportunity to help others to fulfill their aspirations for justice,
                        dignity, and a better life. No more abroad than at home can peace be
                        achieved and maintained without vigorous efforts to meet the needs of the
                        less fortunate.</p>
                    <p>The approaches I am outlining today provide a coherent structure for foreign
                        assistance—with a logical framework for separate but interdependent
                        programs. With the cooperation of Congress, we must seek to identify as
                        clearly as possible which of our purposes—security, humanitarianism, or
                        long-term development of the lower income countries—<pb n="245"
                            xml:id="pg_245" facs="0265"/>to pursue through particular U.S. programs.
                        This is necessary to enable us to determine how much of our resources we
                        wish to put into each, and to assess the progress of each program toward
                        achieving its objectives.</p>
                    <p>There is one point, however, that I cannot over-emphasize. Each program is a
                        part of the whole, and each must be sustained in order to pursue our
                        national purpose in the world of the 'Seventies. It is incumbent upon us to
                        support all component elements—or the total structure will be
                        unworkable.</p>

                        income countries have dramatically changed since the present programs were
                        established. At that time the United States directly provided the major
                        portion of the world's development assistance. This situation led to a large
                        and ambitious U.S. involvement in the policies and activities of the
                        developing countries and required extensive overseas missions to advise
                        governments and monitor programs. Since then the international assistance
                        environment has changed: <list>

                                    <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> the lower income countries have
                                    made impressive progress, as highlighted by the Commission on
                                    International Development chaired by Lester Pearson, the former
                                    Prime Minister of Canada. They have been helped by us and by
                                    others, but their achievements have come largely through their
                                    own efforts. Many have scored agricultural breakthroughs which
                                    have dramatically turned the fear of famine into the hope of
                                    harvest. They have made vast gains in educating their children
                                    and improving their standards of health. The magnitude of their
                                    achievement is indicated by the fact that the lower income
                                    countries taken together exceeded the economic growth targets of
                                    the First United Nations Development Decade. These achievements
                                    have brought a new confidence and self-reliance to people in
                                    communities throughout the world.</p>
                                <p>With the experience that the lower income countries have gained
                                    in mobilizing their resources and setting their own development
                                    priorities, they now can stand at the center of the
                                    international development process—as they should, since the
                                    security and development which is sought is theirs. They clearly
                                    want to do so. Any assistance effort that fails to recognize
                                    these realities cannot succeed.</p>

                                    liberalization and untying of aid must be carried out together

                                efficiently. As a result, a fully effective development effort
                                should encompass much more than government assistance programs if it

                    <p>To meet these changed international conditions, I propose a program for
                        reform in three key areas: to support an expanded role for the international
                        assistance institutions; to reshape our bilateral programs; and to harness
                        all assistance-related policies to improve the effectiveness of our total
                        development effort.</p>
                    <p>My program for reform is a reaffirmation of the commitment of the United
                        States to support the international development process, and I urge the
                        Congress to join me in fulfilling that commitment. We want to help other
                        countries raise their standards of living. We want to use our aid where it
                        can make a difference. To achieve these goals we will respond positively to
                        sound proposals which effectively support the programs of the lower income
                        countries to develop their material and human resources and institutions to
                        enable their citizens to share more fully in the benefits of worldwide
                        technology and economic advance.</p>

                        discuss. He then praised <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry

                        the administration's foreign policy.]</p>
                    <p>If I could come to some other points, the greatest need that I felt we had in
                        the field of foreign policy when we came into office was for perspective,
                        for a long historical perspective.</p>
                    <p>What I say now is not intended to be critical of previous administrations,
                        any of them. It is basically an observation about American foreign policy
                        generally.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the years, American foreign policy has been basically one that
                        reacts to events. That is why, as a matter of fact, when you see young
                        people outside carrying signs, “Peace now, Peace now,” it should not be
                        surprising. We are that kind of people. “Bring the boys home immediately
                        after World War II” regardless of what was going to happen. “End the war,”
                        do this and that and the other thing.</p>
                    <p>The United States people are people who are impatient people. We are a people
                        who find it difficult to take the long view. There is a fundamental reason
                        for that, which is very much to our credit, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>We are the only world power that got to that position without intending to do
                        so. We didn't have a policy to become a world power. It <pb n="248"
                            xml:id="pg_248" facs="0268"/>happened that by the acts of World War II,
                        the fact that all the other major powers in the free world, except the
                        United States, were decimated by the war, all of the powers of Europe, the
                        Japanese in Asia, and all the other industrial powers. Of course, none of
                        them had the ability.</p>
                    <p>Here sat the United States. The action was all in our court. We had to act.
                        Here we were. We didn't plan it that way. We did not have a policy to reach
                        that point.</p>
                    <p>Then, we suddenly found ourselves in the position where what happened in
                        Asia, what happened in the Middle East, what happened in Latin America, what
                        happened in Africa, what happened in Europe, all over the world, we in the
                        United States some way—not because we wanted it, for most Americans didn't
                        want it as a matter of fact, and don't want it, but because no one else was
                        there to fill the vacuum of leadership—we in the United States had to have
                        policies.</p>
                    <p>And that is why we, of course, developed a policy with regard to the defense
                        of Europe. That is why we developed our policy in the field of economic
                        assistance to Latin America and to all the other countries of the world.</p>
                    <p>That is why we had a policy in the Middle East. That is one of the major
                        reasons why we developed a capability in our Armed Forces far beyond the
                        necessity simply to defend the fortress of America. Because we had to have
                        and we did have the responsibility, at least we felt we did, to look to
                        other nations including even our defeated enemies—perhaps them more than
                        others, Japan and Germany, because they, as a result of the war, were forced
                        to complete disarmament and were denied the right to obtain the only
                        armament that means anything for world power, nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>Here sits the United States with the responsibility on our hands.</p>
                    <p>With this kind of background, I have found and I would say this about all of
                        our Administrations, I sat in the Eisenhower Administration for eight years.
                        I know the discussions that were made there.</p>
                    <p>General Eisenhower had a longer view than most Americans. He had been through
                        part of World War I at a very early age and he had seen, of course, much of
                        World War II and had dealt with the great problems of the world. But even
                        then there had not yet developed a long-term perspective. Then came the
                        situation in the years after that.</p>
                    <p>I was not in government. But I think, as I look at the papers that were
                        written at that time, a long-term perspective was not there.</p>
                    <p>So our first instruction to all of the people in our Administration when we
                        came in—Joe <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> knows this is what
                        we said, not only with regard to the Middle East, but with regard to India,
                        Pakistan, areas also under his control, and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Henry Kissinger</persName> who had general charge of it all recognizes
                        that, and I won't go into all the areas we have tried to cover.</p>
                    <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0269"/>
                    <p>It is a mountain of work—we are re-examining every policy and trying to look
                        ahead, not one year, two years, not even five years, not even to the end of
                        this Administration, whether it is two years or six years or what have you,
                        but ahead to the end of a century. That is about as far as we probably can
                        look.</p>
                    <p>As we look ahead at the end of the century, that brings me, if I can for just
                        a moment, come, to the subjects that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> probably has covered in some perspective already,
                        because his presentations are always in this vein.</p>
                    <p>But I would like for you to hear directly from me, to hear first very briefly
                        about the war in Asia and what our plans are, and then if we could look at
                        the Mediterranean and the trip we are planning there, and why it is really
                        being taken. It really isn't a junket, it is for very important reasons
                        which I will not discuss publicly for reasons you will soon see.</p>
                    <p>Then, look at the relations between the two super powers and perhaps one
                        brief look at what the world will be like 10 or 15 years from now if we do
                        play a role.</p>
                    <p>Many years ago, at the time of the Korean War, when it was a great debate as
                        to whether Truman should or should not have gone into Korea, I was talking
                        to a man who is a great expert on the World Communist Movement. He said
                        something that stuck in my mind ever since that time. He said, “Truman had
                        to go into Korea. We had to go into Korea, because what we must remember is
                        that the war in Korea for the Communists is not about Korea. It is about
                        Japan.” Of course, it was.</p>
                    <p>If you look back at it now and see the weak Japan at that time, if Korea had
                        been overrun, and Japan with its very, very strong Socialist party leaning
                        toward the Communists might have—even with the enormous dependence it had at
                        that time upon the United States economically and with certainly even the
                        power that we guaranteed in terms of their defense—Japan would have been
                        pulled inevitably into orbit and toward that orbit. So Korea was about
                        that.</p>
                    <p>I think we could say and we don't need to talk about any common theory. We
                        all argue whether or not that is right. But the point is that as far as the
                        war in Vietnam is concerned, history will record that it was about Vietnam,
                        yes, and the Vietnamese people and whether they survive and have the right
                        to choose their form of government and so forth.</p>
                    <p>But in terms of its impact of how it is ended, that war is not just about
                        Vietnam. It is about Southeast Asia, the Pacific, about Japan, and about, we
                        think, peace in the world generally. Because, if it is ended in a way that
                        encourages those who might embark on any kind of aggression in that part of
                        the world, if it is ended in a way that is interpreted <pb n="250"
                            xml:id="pg_250" facs="0270"/>by the Japanese, for example, the
                        Indonesians, even by our friends in India and Pakistan—that far away not to
                        mention our friends in Europe—if it is interpreted as the failure of the
                        United States in this part of the world in its very difficult but relatively
                        small action, as our failure to achieve a minimum goal, not victory over
                        North Vietnam, but simply the right of the South Vietnamese to choose their
                        own way without having it imposed, the impact would be enormous and I think
                        devastating.</p>
                    <p>That is why despite the great political temptation—and how great it really
                        is—to get it over right now, pull them out, blame whoever started it, et
                        cetera, despite all of that we, I think, have to take the position that we
                        will end the war. We are ending it. It is winding down. It will continue to.
                        But we are going to end it in a way which will discourage those who might
                        engage in aggression, that will not in terms of our enemies and those who
                        might be our enemies encourage those who are, shall we say, the hawks as
                        against the doves, and also in a way that particularly will not dismay our
                        friends in Asia and that part of the world.</p>
                    <p>That is why the long view requires not only ending the war, but then a plan
                        after that, and that is why right at the present time, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EJD1"
                            >Ehrlichman</persName>, two of our top domestic advisers, are in Japan
                        and will shortly be going to South Vietnam for the purpose of taking the
                        long view—what happens afterwards; the development of Southeast Asia, our
                        relations with Japan, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Let me come to the Mediterranean and put it in the same context for a moment.
                        This is a trip to the Sixth Fleet.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Reference is
                            to the President's impending trip to the Mediterranean, which included a
                            visit to the Sixth Fleet. The trip began on September 27, concluded on
                            October 5, and included stops in Italy, Yugoslavia, Spain, England, and
                            Ireland. The Sixth Fleet, however, has implications far beyond simply a
                            routine Presidential inspection. I have gone to carriers before and I
                            have looked at them. I have no reason to want to see how a carrier
                            operates and how the Navy with its marvelous flyers are able to land in
                            a small space and so forth and so on.</note> It could be looked upon as
                        what Presidents do in political campaigns. You go and inspect the fleet or
                        inspect a base. It has been done before. I didn't bring it up for the first
                        time, as you are all aware.</p>
                    <p>But when we look at the Mediterranean and the Sixth Fleet—let me try to put
                        that in the context of history as I see it.</p>
                    <p>If there is one thing that can be said, over the past ten years the American
                        position in the Mediterranean has been rapidly deteriorating and has
                        deteriorated there more than any place in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0271"/>
                    <p>Look at the southern rim of the Mediterranean. Look at the eastern rim of the
                        Mediterranean and the northern rim of the Mediterranean and see what has
                        happened, and you will see why this is the case.</p>
                    <p>When you look at the southern rim of the Mediterranean, ever since the June
                        war in 1967, while the United States still has a strong friend in Morocco,
                        and also a strong friend in Tunisia, both of these countries are relatively
                        weak, both economically and certainly militarily.</p>
                    <p>Next door is Algeria. Algeria is more hopeful at the moment, even though we
                        don't have diplomatic relations established on a formal basis. They have
                        been making certainly rather generous comments, or at least more generous
                        than you would normally expect. I think Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                            >Sisco</persName> would agree.</p>
                    <p>Libya is a country which is enormously affected by the fact that about half
                        of its population is Palestinian refugees. Libya with all of that oil, and
                        with the kind of government it has—who knows what will happen there; the
                        influence, whether the influence will be within Libya, whether it will be by
                        Nasser hanging over them, or for that matter from the Soviet Union. I don't
                        need to talk about Nasser and his problems in Egypt. You are aware of that.
                        It has been discussed earlier.</p>
                    <p>But looking further around, Lebanon always was shaky, and still is, of
                        course.</p>
                    <p>Jordan, a country where you wonder why anybody would ever insure the king. I
                        am sure nobody does. And there are reasons there that have already been
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>Iraq and Syria, countries that at the present time are, as far as we are
                        concerned, ones we have very little information about, except that they are
                        basically irrational and usually antagonistic towards our views.</p>
                    <p>Then we have to go clear over to Iran, which is not in the Middle East, to
                        find a strong, effective support of the United States, or to Saudi Arabians.
                        That is about it.</p>
                    <p>You look at all of that area, sitting in the heart of it is Israel. There is
                        a tendency to look at the Mideast and say, “This conflict is about Israel
                        and its neighbors.” Of course it is. It is about the survival of Israel. But
                        we couldn't make a greater mistake than to think of it in those terms even
                        primarily. Certainly the United States stands for the survival of Israel and
                        the survival of other countries in that area and for their independence and
                        for their ability to defend themselves.</p>
                    <p>But on the other hand, if we look at the Arab-Israeli conflict, we have to
                        remember they have hated each other for thousands of years and they are
                        going to continue for another thousand years and nothing we do or they do is
                        going to solve that—no cease fires, no agreements, <pb n="252"
                            xml:id="pg_252" facs="0272"/>no border guarantees, no U.N. guarantees,
                        no U.S.-Soviet guarantees, nothing.</p>
                    <p>What is it all about then? What it is about in terms of historical
                        perspective is this: A policy which will keep, if we can, this relationship
                        of an uneasy ceasefire, fragile, as has already described, attempting to
                        look down the road when Israel will be able to live with its neighbors in a
                        relative period of live and let-live.</p>
                    <p>That is about all that they can hope for and all that we can hope for. It is
                        putting it in the perspective of history for them and it is very difficult
                        for them to think in this perspective, just as it is for us. They look down
                        the road five years and they realize that they are going to be able to
                        handle any of their neighbors without any question, even though their
                        neighbors have many more planes, many more tanks, and everything else.</p>
                    <p>But looking down the road, 10, 15, 20 years, Egyptians supported enough by
                        the Soviet Union or some other power, can learn to fight and Iraqis and
                        Syrians and all the rest. They never have, but it can be done. We used to
                        not think that Asians could fight. They have proved they could fight pretty
                        well in Korea, and then in Vietnam. So it will be here.</p>
                    <p>So far as Israel is concerned, it has an interest, in my belief at least, it
                        has an interest in making, at least attempting, attempting to bargain when
                        its bargaining position is strong rather than waiting for the time when its
                        bargaining position becomes much more equal with that of its neighbors. So
                        be it.</p>
                    <p>I only indicate that as one of the factors that may eventually bring these
                        nations to some kind of a live-and-let-live attitude.</p>
                    <p>But let us look further. Looking at the northern Mediterranean and some of
                        the policies we have there, I know many in this room—I have seen a few
                        editorials—that are concerned about our policy toward Greece; critical of
                        the fact that we continue to provide military aid to the Greek government
                        for its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, due to the fact that
                        the Greeks have a government that we disapprove of. We do disapprove of
                        their government. They are aware of that.</p>
                    <p>But Greece has 11 divisions in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It is
                        on the southern hinge of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It is right
                        next to Turkey, which also has a number of divisions. And as far as Greece
                        is concerned, while we of course try to use our influence as effectively as
                        we can, but not in a way that will put them on the spot publicly and create
                        exactly the opposite effect that we want, it is essential that the United
                        States continue to support <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in
                        Greece and we will do so.</p>
                    <p>You move on over. Italy has had problems ever since World War II; a divided
                        government, too many parties and not one strong enough—not a really strong
                        man since De Gasperi, except for Saragat, the <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253"
                            facs="0273"/>President, who of course has never been head of the
                        government. His party is too small; he has just been head of state.</p>
                    <p>We go on to Spain. Here again we have one of those tough ones. From an
                        ideological standpoint, people in this country don't like the idea of
                        America supporting a man, Franco, who 35 years ago left the taste in the
                        mouth of dictatorship. And we would, I think, in this room subscribe to our
                        antipathy to the kind of rule that he imposed then and that he has now.</p>
                    <p>Yet here is Spain, the western hinge. And if Spain, is what we are involved
                        in there, where our bases are involved, if we look at the whole
                        Mediterranean policy and speak of it completely, shall we say, in the
                        idealistic terms that I would like to always speak of, and that you would
                        like to write about and speak of, we shouldn't have any bases in Spain.</p>
                    <p>We should let the Greeks go.</p>
                    <p>The Turks, we don't like their government too well either because it isn't
                        too democratic. As far as the southern hinge is concerned, the southern part
                        of the Mediterranean is concerned, we just let that slip and slide.</p>
                    <p>That is what the short-range attitude would be. But we have to look at the
                        whole Mediterranean. We are looking at the whole Mediterranean. And there
                        are times we are going to have to make decisions that will have to put first
                        things first. We are going to use our influence always to bring other people
                        toward those kinds of principles that we believe people throughout the
                        world, regardless of their background, have a right to have in their
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>But we, on the other hand, feel that where American interests are involved,
                        the interests of free nations generally, it is vitally important that the
                        Mediterranean not be allowed to create the vacuum, to continue to
                        deteriorate as it has been deteriorating.</p>
                    <p>Now comes the Sixth Fleet. What good do a few carriers and cruisers and the
                        rest do down there? It has an enormous effect, an enormous effect because it
                        is a presence. If we have any doubt about what good it does, we can look to
                        see what our potential opponents in the world—when I say “potential
                        opponents”, I don't use the word “enemy” because we live in a world that is
                        too dangerous for super powers to be enemies. We hope to work out with the
                        Soviet Union a live-and-let-live attitude, even though their interests are
                        very different.</p>
                    <p>The way to work out that attitude, live-and-let-live policy, is to recognize
                        once and for all that we aren't going to agree on everything, we aren't
                        going to like each other too well as far as our systems are concerned, they
                        are going to be different, our interests are going to conflict. They have a
                        different attitude about Europe, about Asia, about Africa, about Latin
                        America, and they are still expansionists.</p>
                    <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0274"/>
                    <p>We are, on the other hand, thinking in terms of defense all around the world.
                        But when we look at the situation—what are they doing about the
                        Mediterranean? If you have any doubts about sea power, you will see. It
                        grows. It is still far short of ours. It will not catch ours, not in the
                        foreseeable future.</p>
                    <p>I am speaking not of its nuclear submarine power where they will catch us in
                        1974 nuclear missile-carrying submarines, but I am speaking in terms of sea
                        power generally.</p>
                    <p>And if that sea power is allowed to grow to the point which it could, with
                        our doing nothing—where it is superior to ours in the Mediterranean, you can
                        see the effect that is going to have on the American presence in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>When we speak of the Mediterranean, the Mideast and the rest, you have got to
                        put it in the larger context. We all know the Mideast is the gateway to
                        Africa. We all know that the Mideast is the source of 80 percent of Europe's
                        oil and 90 percent of Japan's oil. We all know too that it is the southern
                        hinge of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>That is why we try to think not in terms simply of the hijackers on four
                        planes: Arabs versus Israeli, of what we do about the Italian Government
                        today, and Spanish bases, we have to look at the whole picture and see what
                        kind of a situation we are going to be faced with five or ten years from
                        now.</p>
                    <p>How can we improve the American and free-world position in the Mediterranean?
                        We don't do it alone. That is why we are helping the British, the Italians,
                        to the extent they can, the Spanish, the French and everybody else to play
                        their role.</p>
                    <p>So much for that bit of analysis, a case history.</p>
                    <p>Now, I would go on to a couple of other points, and I will be through, to
                        illustrate. In the perspective of history, let me talk briefly about <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> can be looked upon as a new defensive
                        weapons system, of very doubtful efficiency, doubtful until it is tried, and
                        nobody knows. I hope we never find out, or have to find out, whether or not
                        it will be useful.</p>
                    <p>We think it might. Certainly the Soviet Union thinks it might.</p>
                    <p>But as we look today at the power balance and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Henry Kissinger</persName> has covered this already with you I am sure,
                        we find that the enormous advantage that the United States had in 1961 has
                        gone down. This is not said critically of the Administrations of the past.
                        It was inevitable to go down, because the United States maintained its
                        level, the Soviet Union came up.</p>
                    <p>Whereas, there was at least a ten to one advantage of the United States over
                        the Soviet Union at the time of the Cuban missile crisis in <pb n="255"
                            xml:id="pg_255" facs="0275"/>terms of Intercontinental Ballistic
                        Missiles. Today it is even, with the throw weight, three to one in their
                        favor.</p>
                    <p>That doesn't mean that at this point the United States is behind, because we
                        have been doing some things, too, that are effective. The development of our
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> program, moving on certain areas,
                        and we still have enormous advantages in air power. We have enormous
                        advantages on the sea still at this point.</p>
                    <p>But looking to the future, what the United States must remember is this:
                        Take, for example, the field of nuclear submarines. If we decided now that
                        we had to do something to maintain an adequate number of nuclear submarines
                        vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, we couldn't have the first one until eight years
                        from now. That is why decisions have to be made in the long term, rather
                        than the short term. That is why again we look at the Sixth Fleet, not just
                        in terms of its mission in the Mediterranean today, but where is it going to
                        be six, eight years from now and what should we do in this country having
                        that in mind.</p>
                    <p>Again, getting back to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, so we decide at
                        this point that we will go for a defensive system in order to maintain what
                        we describe as sufficiency for the United States, and not to allow the
                        balance to get out.</p>
                    <p>Let me talk very candidly about why I think that is important. An argument
                        can be made, I have heard it made quite eloquently often around our Cabinet
                        tables from time to time, particularly by outside experts, to the effect
                        that enough is enough. It doesn't make any difference if the Soviet Union
                        has ten times as much as we have, or Communist China 25 years from now might
                        have that much.</p>
                    <p>The answer is maybe. But on the other hand, try to tell that to your European
                        allies. Tell it to a Germany, or a Japan, with no nuclear power.</p>
                    <p>The point that I make is this: I do not suggest that the United States for
                        some jingoistic reason, because of cold war rhetoric, as it is described,
                        has to be number one in the world in every respect, but I do say that as far
                        as that when the time comes, when those who depend upon the umbrella of U.S.
                        power, when they reach the conclusion that the United States has settled for
                        an inferior position on the sea, or in terms overall roughly of the balance
                        between missiles, offensive and defensive, then the United States no longer
                        can play the role which unfortunately—I say unfortunately because it would
                        be so much easier to concentrate on all of these domestic problems that
                        start crying out for a solution—we could not play the role that history has
                        cast upon us to play of being the nation that makes it possible for other
                        nations to grow up in freedom and independence, without having a Soviet or
                        Chinese and Communist system imposed upon them.</p>
                    <p>That finally brings me to the last point I would like to make. I often get
                        the question, “As you look way ahead, what is the most difficult <pb n="256"
                            xml:id="pg_256" facs="0276"/>the United States has?” And I could say, of
                        course, “Well, it is ending the war in Vietnam, the policy in the Mid East,
                        a new policy in Europe, maintaining the weapons balance,” and the rest. All
                        of those things are important, not the most difficult, because they are
                        soluble in the long run either by diplomacy or money or some other
                        method.</p>
                    <p>But the real problem basically goes much deeper than that. And it basically
                        is something that I particularly convey to you. I know that in this room
                        there are very honest men who disagree with some of our policies, our
                        Cambodian decision, our decision to continue the war in Vietnam to what we
                        believe is a just peace, rather than ending it more precipitately, people
                        who disagree with our decision to go on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>,
                        who may disagree with some of the things I have said in other areas.</p>
                    <p>That I understand, I appreciate, I respect. I hope we always have it in this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>But one thing I would say very strongly at this point is as I look down the
                        road, the next 25 years, I am convinced that there isn't any question about
                        the ability of the United States to continue to play a helpful and
                        constructive role in the world. I say thank God the United States is the
                        nation that has the responsibility of leadership. The United States isn't
                        going to attack anybody else. The United States isn't trying to get anything
                        from anybody else. We are not trying to extend or impose our system on
                        anybody else.</p>
                    <p>All we want is peace for ourselves, freedom for ourselves, and we hope peace
                        and freedom, if we can, for other nations in the world.</p>
                    <p>That is the kind of a leader that the free world, I think, desperately needs
                        and would want and would trust.</p>
                    <p>The question is, whether we in this country—our young people, for that
                        matter, older people with all of our tremendous domestic problems—whether we
                        have the stamina and the character and basically I come back to the
                        fundamental point, whether we have the wisdom to take the long view, to see
                        what the world would be like if the United States did draw into itself and
                        say, “Who else, who is left?” Not the Germans, not the Japanese, not the
                        British, not the French, no one else in the world can assume this
                        responsibility of leadership.</p>
                    <p>So, as we look at that world and what it is going to be like, I am convinced
                        that this Administration will do the best it can for the balance of the time
                        we are there.</p>
                    <p>But I am convinced that you gentlemen have in your hands, through your
                        editorials, through your television commentary, over the period of time,
                        that you have an even greater responsibility and one that can have an ever
                        greater impact to develop within this country the sense of perspective and
                        sense of judgment.</p>
                    <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0277"/>
                    <p>I could even say a sense of destiny which a nation like ours needs—which we
                        need, not because we want to be number one or Mr. Big or anything like that,
                        but because at this time we happen to live in a world where unless we do,
                        the situation as far as the rest of the world is concerned would be that
                        most of the nations of the world, except for the other two great super
                        powers, the Soviet Union and China, would simply be living in terror of what
                        would happen.</p>
                    <p>So, we appreciated a chance to come here and share some thoughts with you at
                        this media briefing. We have now had three of them, we are going to have
                        another one in the Northeast shortly, and I am sorry that I have gone over
                        the time that I expected to talk.</p>
                    <p>But I did want to share with you, not simply the decisions that we make and
                        why we make them—that has been done better than I can by the experts who
                        work on it day to day—but I did want you to know some of the things that
                        sometimes you wonder, “What does he think about when he goes in the Lincoln
                        sitting room and sits up late at night? What does he think about when he
                        goes to Camp <persName>David</persName> and the rest”?</p>
                    <p>I don't think always simply about subjects as heavy as this. But I can assure
                        you that at this time, above everything else, I try not to become enmeshed
                        in the details that someone else can handle, not to become bogged down in
                        making decisions like what is going to be the bombing run tomorrow, here,
                        there and everyplace.</p>
                    <p>But I try constantly to bring to these discussions the sense of perspective
                        that America has never had because we didn't need it, but now that we have
                        got to have because not only we need it, but the world needs it.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>

                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine at perhaps exorbitant length. But one of the
                        problems that we have faced in connection with our foreign policy and with
                        the transition from a period in which the United States carried the almost
                        exclusive responsibility to one in which we are trying to share increasingly
                        our responsibility with others, is the fear of many countries, particularly
                        of many allies, that the United States might withdraw from its
                        responsibilities altogether.</p>
                    <p>Whenever we have met Europeans over recent months, European leaders over
                        recent months, this has been one of their principal concerns. It turned out
                        to be one of the important concerns of Italian leaders when we saw them
                        yesterday, one of whom pointed out to us that the first visit of the
                        President here in February was very important but the one this week was
                        really quite crucial in reassuring the Europeans, and particularly the
                        countries of the Mediterranean, that the United States was not withdrawing
                        into isolationism, but, rather, remained committed to its alliances.</p>
                    <p>I mention this because the President has reiterated wherever he has been that
                        the United States did not intend to make any unilateral reductions of its
                        forces; that we considered the problems of the Western Alliance a concern
                        for all the countries.</p>
                    <p>What we attempted to do this afternoon was to review with our commanders in
                        the Mediterranean two problems. One, the problems <pb n="259"
                            xml:id="pg_259" facs="0279"/>posed for the southern flank of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by the developments in the Mediterranean
                        over recent years and partly by the growth of the Soviet naval presence in
                        the Mediterranean, and, secondly, to draw some lessons from the experiences
                        of recent weeks, to review the experiences of recent weeks, and to see about
                        the relationship between our strength in this area and the prospect for
                        stability in this area.</p>
                    <p>We thought that this was particularly important, because, as I pointed out in
                        the backgrounder I gave before we left, we are not only interested,
                        obviously, in the aspect of how to protect the security of these countries,
                        or help to protect the security, but how we can contribute to a more stable
                        and more permanent peace, a problem which we want particularly to explore in
                        our next stop when we visit Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p>So, what we had this afternoon was a full review of the various capabilities
                        in the Mediterranean, both as they affected <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and as they affected other areas.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of official U.S. attendance at the funeral of
                        United Arab Republic President Nasser.]</p>
                    <p>Q. Doctor, it seems at times that the relationship between the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine as enunciated at Guam was
                        not entirely clear in relationship to the President's statements concerning
                        our role and our future role and our intentions in the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, in his opening remarks with President Saragat,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d72fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s arrival statement in Rome on September 27. For
                            text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the
                                United States : <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                                Nixon</persName>, 1970,</hi> p. 772.</note> I believe he was talking
                        along the lines that we intend to see to it that this will not become the
                        place where future wars will begin. Can you talk about this statement in
                        connection with the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is great for my
                        ego, but it is very dangerous. The question is that the relationship between
                        the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and some of the
                        pronouncements on this trip did not seem self-evident to the questioner,
                        particularly the opening remarks to President Saragat where the President
                        said, “We will see to it”, or some words to that effect, “that peace in this
                        area will be maintained.”</p>
                    <p>Let me say two things about it. First, we have always brought out the fact
                        that there can never be a neat breakoff point between American foreign
                        policy in one place and another.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, it is clear that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine had always envisaged a continuation of some significant American
                        presence in crucial areas of the world where that American presence was
                        necessary and was considered to be in the American interest.</p>
                    <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0280"/>
                    <p>Both of these conditions obtain in the Mediterranean. The objective of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine continues to be
                        one of the guidelines, or the guideline, of our foreign policy. We intend to
                        shift an increasing amount of responsibility to our allies. We intend to
                        cooperate with them more fully than has been the case in the past, and we do
                        look to them to make their contribution.</p>
                    <p>But we also recognize that the threat in the Mediterranean may have grown
                        larger than anyone assumed over, say, 10 years ago, and, therefore, we
                        recognize that some of the measures that are possible in other parts of the
                        world do not apply with equal force here. But the basic objectives
                        remain.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is the remainder of the briefing, devoted largely to questions
                        relating to the Middle East.]</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this trip, just as has been the purpose of my other trips
                        abroad, is to strengthen the structure of peace throughout the world, and
                        particularly is to strengthen the structure of peace in the Mediterranean
                        area which, because of recent events, has been an area of very great concern
                        for all those interested in peace.</p>
                    <p>Now, in analyzing what the threat to peace in the Mediterranean is, we must
                        realize that it is not the conventional threat of one nation possibly
                        engaging in overt action against another. It is more difficult than that,
                        more difficult because it is the threat which arises from irresponsible
                        radical elements which might take action which, in turn, would set in the
                        course of events, the train of events, set in motion—I meant to say—a train
                        of events, that would escalate into a possible confrontation between major
                        powers in the area. That is what we saw in the Jordanian crisis and that is
                        the kind of threat to the peace that we will have to be <pb n="261"
                            xml:id="pg_261" facs="0281"/>guarding against in the months and possibly
                        the years ahead in the Near East and the Mediterranean generally.</p>
                    <p>Now, when you have that kind of a threat, in order to meet it the primary
                        need is for elements of stability in the area, economic and political
                        stability, yes, but primarily, where the threat is irresponsible and where
                        it resorts to violence, unexpected and unpredictable violence, without
                        reason, without cause—sometimes—there must be military stability and
                        military strength. That is why I first visited the 6th Fleet.</p>
                    <p>The 6th Fleet is one element of military stability in the Mediterranean.
                        After visiting the 6th Fleet and being briefed by its commanders and our
                        commanders there, I became convinced that the 6th Fleet is able to meet its
                        mission of deterring irresponsible elements in the Mediterranean area.</p>
                    <p>After meeting with the 6th Fleet commanders and, also, after having discussed
                        this matter with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and with
                        our ambassadors from the Mediterranean countries, I am convinced that it is
                        essential that the 6th Fleet continue to have this capability in the event
                        that other powers, with other designs on the area, other than ours and our
                        friends who have no designs except the peace in the area, and the right of
                        each individual nation to maintain its own integrity—in the event that other
                        forces, naval forces, should threaten the position of strength which the 6th
                        Fleet now enjoys, then the United States must be prepared to take the action
                        necessary to maintain that overall strength of the 6th Fleet.</p>
                    <p>So what I am saying here is the 6th Fleet presently can meet its mission and,
                        second, we shall be prepared to increase its strength in the event that its
                        position of overall strength is threatened by the actions of other powers
                        who take another position in the area than we do.</p>
                    <p>Another element of strength in the Mediterranean area is, of course, <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and particularly its Southern Command.
                        Without going into the specific conversations that we had with the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Southern Commanders, I would emphasize
                        here that this provided an opportunity for me to state very strongly and
                        unequivocally these principles with regard to the United States association
                        with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Considerable concern, I find, has arisen among many of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations, the major nations and the
                        smaller <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations, as a result of some
                        comments by political figures in the United States as well as some of those
                        commenting upon the American role in the world, that the United States might
                        not meet its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> responsibilities and was
                        on the verge of reducing its contribution to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>. I stated categorically to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Commanders, and I do it here publicly again, that the
                        United States will, under no circumstances, reduce, unilaterally, its
                        commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Any reduction in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces, if it occurs, will only <pb
                            n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0282"/>take place on a multilateral basis
                        and on the basis of what those who are lined up against the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces—what they might do. In other
                        words, it would have to be on a mutual basis.</p>
                    <p>I know that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine has
                        sometimes been inaccurately described as one that would allow the United
                        States to reduce its responsibilities in the world. That is not the case.
                        The purpose of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is
                        to provide a policy under which the United States can meet its
                        responsibilities more effectively in the world by sharing those
                        responsibilities with others. And in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        that is our policy.</p>
                    <p>To summarize, with regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we will
                        maintain our present strength. We will not reduce it unilaterally. We will
                        continue to talk with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies with
                        regard to how, overall, we can meet our responsibilities together.</p>
                    <p>Moving from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> now to the Mideast, I found
                        in the conversations that I had with all of the leaders that I met—and, as
                        you know, they covered not only our allies and friends but also they covered
                        President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> of Yugoslavia, a
                        nonaligned state—I found general agreement on these propositions: strong
                        support for the American cease-fire initiative; and, second, I found that,
                        as far as that cease-fire initiative is concerned, that there is not the
                        pessimism that we sense in some quarters, as a result of what happened in
                        Jordan and as a result of the new instability that inevitably will follow
                        the death of President Nasser, that the cease-fire initiative's days were
                        numbered.</p>
                    <p>I do not suggest that the road ahead is not difficult. But I think we have to
                        separate our peace initiative into two parts: one, the cease-fire part of
                        the initiative; and, second, that part of the initiative that has to do with
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>With regard to negotiation, the prospect for immediate negotiation between
                        the two or three or other parties involved on either side—as far as those
                        prospects are concerned—they are, at this time, not bright because of the
                        introduction of missiles into the 50-kilometer zone.</p>
                    <p>The reaction of the Israelis, of course, has been not to participate in
                        negotiation. However, we are going to continue to attempt to get the
                        negotiating process started and, of course, in the process, to do what we
                        can diplomatically to see that there are no further violations of the
                        standstill, and dealing, of course, diplomatically, with the violations that
                        have occurred. So much for the negotiation side of it.</p>
                    <p>On the cease-fire side of it, however, I think I can say quite unequivocally
                        that neither party—and by neither party I say neither the Israelis on the
                        one side or the other nations, the U.A.R. and others involved in the
                        cease-fire initiative—will gain by breaking the cease-fire. That is why we
                        believe that our acting and talking strongly in behalf of an <pb n="263"
                            xml:id="pg_263" facs="0283"/>extension of the cease-fire for another 90
                        days is the proper course and that it has considerable chance to succeed.
                        Because any party at this time that would break the cease-fire initiative
                        would have very, very little support in the world. It would be acting alone
                        against the whole weight of the world public opinion and also against the
                        weight of public opinion, I should say, in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Another comment with regard to the Mideast that I think should be made: We
                        tend in the United States to see our role as being predominant and, of
                        course, it is because of our strength. On the other hand, we must recognize,
                        and this trip brought this home to me and underlined it again, that there
                        are other powers in the Mediterranean area that can play, that are playing,
                        and that must play, a significant role in the peacekeeping area.</p>
                    <p>The Italians, for example, have a very significant interest in the
                        Mediterranean and have contacts that we do not have that are better than
                        ours. The Spanish also have very significant interests in the Mediterranean
                        and have been very helpful. And the British, in addition, of course, have
                        had a traditional, longtime interest in the Mediterranean area. My talks
                        with the leaders of these three countries were very helpful in that respect
                        because it is not a healthy situation in the world for the United States to
                        be alone, whether it is in the Far East, where we welcome the fact that the
                        British are maintaining a presence there, or whether it is in the Mideast,
                        or in the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>That is why the Secretary of State and I have worked, both before we arrived
                        on this trip and during this trip, on developing not only consultation but
                        participation on the part of other Mediterranean powers who share our views
                        about the area, and participation and responsibility for keeping the peace
                        in that area.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are the President's concluding remarks devoted primarily to his
                        impressions of the trip and the leaders with whom he met.]</p>

                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> of a new proposal for a settlement in
                        Southeast Asia he intended to deliver in a televised speech later that day,
                        related discussion of problems within the South Vietnamese economy that
                        complicated prospects for a settlement, and limited discussion of the
                        President's European trip. For the text of the President's speech, see <hi

                    <p>Turning to a more general theme, the President remarked to the Cabinet that
                        “We have been through some difficult times since we came here.” But he added
                        that he was not pessimistic about the international situation. He said he
                        found on his European trip that “other countries want the U.S. to play a
                        role in the world.” While there is often shouting against the U.S., he said,
                        the attitude becomes quite different when a suggestion is made seriously
                        that the U.S. should “go home.” Then, he said, the attitude becomes “Oh, no,
                        don't go.” He remarked that President Marcos of the Philippines had told him
                        earlier that while it was politically popular to say that the United States
                        must go, it was also quite necessary to say privately, “I hope that you
                        don't.”</p>
                    <p>“We are the most powerful nation in the world,” the President said. “But no
                        nation in the world fears the United States. This is the greatest asset we
                        have in diplomacy.” The U.S., the President went on, is “the only nation in
                        history that hasn't used its power to acquire more power. This country can
                        be proud of its role in the world and we should stand up and say so.”</p>
                    <p>As the President reached this point in his remarks, Secretary of Housing and
                        Urban Development, <persName>George Romney</persName>, said he felt that
                        everyone in the room “thanks God that you, Mr. President, are at the head of
                        this country's government at this time and are handling our role in the
                        world with such great skill.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he believed that “it may take 40 years for it to be
                        written but it is the truth that America never worked for a better cause <pb
                            n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0285"/>than it has in Vietnam. If we can
                        bring the war to a close, if we can give South Vietnam a chance, this will
                        be an achievement of which we can be extremely proud. I am sorry that a
                        Republican Mayor said that our best young men went to Canada to avoid
                        serving in the Armed Forces. I say our best young men went to Vietnam.”</p>
                    <p>As the President left the room, the Cabinet gave him a standing ovation.</p>

                    <p>During the course of a general discussion of foreign policy issues and
                        domestic considerations on October 12, 1970, President <persName

                            Kissinger</persName> weighed the responsibilities of leadership:</p>
                    <p>“P: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—what it will be like for the next
                        25 years depends on whether we have the guts, the stamina, the wisdom to
                        exert leadership, will determine whether the future of the country … that is
                        really what the facts are. People may want to put their heads in the sand;
                        they may want to clean up the ghettos. All right, we will get out of the
                        world. Who is left? The two activists, Russia and Communist China.</p>
                    <p>“K: If you will look at countries like Austria. When they had great political
                        power they also did great things domestically. Now they are just shrunk into
                        weak petty countries.</p>
                    <p>“P: All these people are concerned about peace in the world. We go to the
                        sidelines and there are a couple of big boys out there ready to play— China
                        and Russia. All we are doing is fighting for the right of countries to be
                        free.</p>
                    <p>“K: Their conflicts are going to be infinitely more bitter than anything we
                        participate in.” (Memorandum of telephone conversation, October 12, 1970,

                            Mexico was Acting Chairman in the absence of Senator Russell B. Long of

                        opportunity to discuss with your committee the pending Trade Act. My
                        comments will be made against the background of our relations with friendly
                        countries and in the light of our position in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>Last year the President sent to the Congress a proposed Trade Act<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d76fn3">See <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>.</note> which
                        followed in the tradition of American trade legislation designed to increase
                        trade and prosperity by reducing barriers and obstacles to peaceful commerce
                        in the world. In major part because of vigorous American leadership,
                        international trade since World War II has been substantially relieved of
                        the restrictions and distortions that we had inherited from the 1930's.</p>
                    <p>I would remind the committee that in the 25 years since the end of the Second
                        World War the world has had the longest period of sustained and rapid income
                        growth in history, thanks in very important part to the unblocking of the
                        channels of trade. The American people, along with peoples everywhere, have
                        been the beneficiaries of this unprecedented period of prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The legislation before you incorporates many of the provisions that the
                        President requested in his initial proposal to the Congress, including
                        limited tariff cutting authority, liberalization of adjustment assistant
                        provisions of the present Trade Expansion Act, and authority to eliminate
                        the “American Selling Price” system of valuation.</p>
                    <p>It includes also a provision for the establishment of domestic international
                        sales corporations, intended to assist our exports, which the administration
                        subsequently had requested. The President has also indicated his willingness
                        to accept a provision for restrictions on certain textile imports because
                        our efforts to find other solutions to problems in our textile trade have
                        thus far been unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>The administration recognizes that the world environment is changing, that
                        new economic, trade, and investment problems are <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267"
                            facs="0287"/>appearing and that new approaches may be necessary. The
                        President, therefore, has commissioned a group of distinguished Americans
                        under the leadership of Albert Williams to study the emerging situation and
                        to recommend a comprehensive set of foreign trade and investment policies
                        for the 1970's.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, a bill limited to the provisions I have just enumerated
                        would be a positive factor in our relations with the rest of the world. It
                        would be accepted by our trading partners as evidence of American intention
                        to continue along the broad lines of the post-war commercial policy that has
                        served us all so well. It would be taken as a signal that the United States
                        will maintain its place of leadership in the development of the world
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>It would put us in a favorable position to achieve further reductions in
                        barriers to our exports. It would permit us, I believe, to deal with the
                        difficult problems in our textile trade in a manner calculated to minimize
                        difficulties with supplying nations.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the bill before you includes a number of additional provisions
                        which the President did not request and which the administration considers
                        to be contrary to the national interest. Primary among these are, first,
                        provisions for quotas on individual items apart from textiles and, second,
                        the potential extension of restrictions, including quotas, to many other
                        products through an excessive loosening of the escape clause.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the proposed bill would depart from past escape-clause
                        procedure by setting an arbitrary arithmetic formula to be used in assessing
                        injury. I must tell you that if other countries were to apply this approach
                        to our own exports, there would be grave damage to the sales of hundreds of
                        American firms and to the jobs of hundreds of thousands of American firms
                        and to the jobs of hundreds of thousands of American workers.</p>
                    <p>I urge this committee, therefore, to recommend to the Senate the elimination
                        of these undesired and potentially damaging features of the legislation.</p>
                    <p>We have made a careful assessment of the impact of this bill, not only upon
                        our economic interests, but also upon our international interests. We are
                        convinced that it would cause serious harm to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, we have heard from other countries about their views of the
                        legislation as it now stands. The President and I heard some of these views
                        at firsthand during our recent journey to Europe. The reactions abroad to
                        the pending bill are those of deep concern and even alarm at the apparent
                        direction of American policy.</p>
                    <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0288"/>
                    <p>Our trading partners fear that the United States is about to make an historic
                        turn in its foreign trade policy. Just as we have led the trading world on
                        the way to a steady reduction of trade barriers, it is now feared that our
                        example could drive the trading world back to the kind of bilateralism and
                        restrictionism that crippled international commerce, including our own, in
                        the 1930's, and contributed to the disastrous consequences that we all
                        know.</p>
                    <p>It may be said that these fears are unjustified, that the proposed
                        legislation merely seeks to deal with certain special and urgent problems of
                        the United States, and that other nations too have restrictions on imports.
                        The fact is, however, that the legislation before you could lead to
                        restrictions on a very large volume of U.S. trade, as much as $3 billion or
                        more, and other nations are acutely aware of this.</p>
                    <p>It is also a fact that the very size of the United States in the world
                        economy lends special weight and emphasis to everything we do and that our
                        actions do set an example, for good, or bad, for everyone else. Obviously,
                        other nations have trade restrictions, as of course we do. But we and the
                        rest of the world recognize that the way to a reduction of the remaining
                        obstacles to trade in the world is through hard, reciprocal bargaining, not
                        by adding new and unnecessary obstacles.</p>
                    <p>Considering the potential damage to trade and the amount of public attention
                        that has been and will be given to this matter, it must be expected that
                        other governments would not be able to accept passively increased trade
                        restrictions by the United States.</p>
                    <p>There is widespread fear of an impending trade war that no one wishes,
                        neither we nor our trading partners. But we must realize that the political
                        pressures on other governments could be so great as to lead to retaliatory
                        actions against our trade. We are a very large exporter and in some fields
                        the volume of our more dynamic export items already gives rise to foreign
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>I hope that the Congress will give us a trade bill which will preclude any
                        possibility of serious retaliation. I think it is my duty, nevertheless, to
                        tell you what easily might happen, and it would be wrong for us to minimize
                        the travesty of the situation that we might come to face.</p>
                    <p>Let me add that a liberal trade policy is essential if the developing
                        countries are to achieve the self-reliance that the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine seeks to encourage. If we
                        are going to foster self-reliance by the developing countries of the world,
                        we must not deny to them the possibility of earning their own way. If we do
                        that, we shall undermine the very processes that generate self-confidence
                        and growth. The consequence will be that we will hurt them and ourselves as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The legislation before you appears in some respects to give the President a
                        wide degree of flexibility in the application of the provisions <pb n="269"
                            xml:id="pg_269" facs="0289"/>of the legislation. Some may argue that
                        this will enable the President to avoid the application of the worst
                        features of the bill. But in many instances, this flexibility could not be
                        used.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, it would be extremely costly to discriminate among countries in
                        order to moderate the impact of the legislation. We are solemnly committed,
                        in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in many bilateral
                        treaties, to treat other countries on a nondiscriminatory,
                        most-favored-nation basis. To do otherwise would be to dishonor our
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>We have economic and trading interests everywhere. We do not want to become a
                        victim of a world fragmented into trading blocs and bilateral arrangements.
                        It would ill serve our Nation to take the lead in restricting trade and
                        damaging or destroying the principle of most-favored-nation treatment that
                        is now written in our own basic trade law.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman, I have spoken out of deep concern for the potential damage to
                        our industry and agriculture of certain features of the legislation that you
                        are considering. It is possible for this committee to propose to the Senate
                        a bill that will advance our economic interests, not retard them, that will
                        uphold our status and position in world affairs and that will still enable
                        the administration to deal effectively and constructively with the pressing
                        problems of specific firms and industries in our domestic economy.</p>
                    <p>A statute that is limited to the provisions recommended or supported by the
                        administration will do that. A statute with additional and restrictive
                        features, such as are contained in H.R. 18970, on the other hand, would
                        threaten our economic interests and would undermine our position in the
                        world, without meeting the true nature of our particular problems at
                        home.</p>
                    <p>I earnestly invite you to look upon our trade legislation as part and parcel
                        if our total national interests and in the framework of a coherent political
                        and economic policy that takes into account our domestic needs and our world
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>I urge this committee, therefore, and the Senate to remove from the bill
                        these unneeded and dangerous features and to send to the President trade
                        legislation consistent with our tradition of leadership and with our
                        national interests.</p>
                    <p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is the opening portion of the conversation, in which <persName

                            >Gromyko</persName>, suggested topics for discussion, and invited
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s response. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> began by expressing his
                        government's concern about the tenor of U.S.-Soviet relations, which he said
                        seemed to be at variance with the President's stated intent to convert an
                        era of confrontation into an era of negotiation. Speaking for his
                        government, he said the Soviet Union would like to see a lessening of
                        tensions and an improvement and expansion of relations with the United
                        States.]</p>
                    <p>The President replied that with respect to the bilateral relations between
                        our two countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        indeed described his policy correctly, the policy on moving from an era of
                        confrontation into a era of negotiation. The President also agreed with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s comments to the effect
                        that the internal situation of a country should not be allowed to influence
                        its foreign relations. However, since both countries are great powers, he
                        was enough of a realist to know that when great powers are involved there
                        were inevitably bound to be some misunderstandings. He thought Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would agree that the President had
                        been extremely careful to try to limit differences between them to private
                        discussions rather than discussions in public. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, being a realist, would know that
                        in our country whenever elections approached political leaders were tempted
                        to take a belligerent anti-Communist line. As for the President personally,
                        he did not consider such an approach to be in the interests of world peace
                        or of Soviet-American relations. For this reason, he had personally tried to
                        avoid any statement that might make the situation worse.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that he felt very strongly that both sides, allies
                        during World War II, who were instrumental in bringing into <pb n="271"
                            xml:id="pg_271" facs="0291"/>being the United Nations, must realize on
                        this 25th anniversary of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that the
                        relations and the interests of the two great powers could hardly be
                        submitted to the United Nations where their differences would be publicly
                        resolved [exposed?]. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                        spoken before the General Assembly yesterday and the President intended to
                        do so tomorrow. However, in the next 25 years, world peace in general and,
                        more precisely even, avoidance of smaller wars would depend to a much
                        greater extent on the relations between the United States and the Soviet
                        Union than on anything else. For this reason, he felt unhappy that the
                        relations between our countries were now the coolest since the cold war
                        began. He had been very careful not to contribute to the difficult situation
                        by rhetoric. He thought it was of greatest importance now to give a signal
                        to the world that the United States and the Soviet Union were not looking
                        for areas in which to confront each other. To be honest, we had to realize
                        that our interests in many parts of the world differed and that on some
                        questions it would be most difficult to reach agreed positions. However, it
                        was clearly in the common interests of both great powers to limit the burden
                        of armaments, to increase trade and communications between them. It was in
                        this spirit that he was resolved to view our bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that he found the
                        President's appraisal of the situation to be a reasonable one. He asked the
                        President's permission to summarize what had been said to the effect that
                        the policy of the United States would be directed at reducing the tensions
                        which were bound to arise from time to time and that the President's formula
                        of negotiation rather than confrontation remained in effect; also that the
                        President personally intended to work for an improvement and deepening of
                        the relations between the two countries and the international situation in
                        general.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed that this was correct and added the further point that
                        in the past we had been reasonably successful and it was his hope that we
                        would be even more successful in the future whenever difficulties arose to
                        keep them in private channels rather than expose them in public. In the past
                        we may have been at fault to some extent, and so was the Soviet Union, in
                        publicizing our differences. This was in the past, however, and it would be
                        important to avoid that in the future.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was correct.
                        Articles in the Soviet press in the past reporting what was being said in
                        the United States in regard to the Soviet Union had been but a small
                        fraction of unfavorable American statements about the Soviet Union. After
                        all, when hostile statements appeared in the U.S., what was there left for
                        the Soviet Union to do but to react accordingly? The Soviet side would not
                        remain indebted when it came to hostile statements. This was not the right
                        path, however. He <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0292"/>noted that the
                        President had mentioned the development of trade relations between the two
                        countries. In this respect, we were faced by almost a vacuum. Was this
                        indeed the policy of the United States Government? He simply would like to
                        know the President's attitude to this question.</p>
                    <p>The President said that there were possibilities in this field. He thought
                        one would have to be realistic and say that some of the other problems come
                        into play when it comes to considering the possibility of increasing trade
                        between the two countries. For example, the Vietnam war, which involved our
                        primary and basic interests, was bound to have an inhibiting influence upon
                        the possibilities of trade. Due to the fact that under our legislative
                        arrangements some items which could be used to aid North Vietnam could not
                        be exported to the Soviet Union. We were indeed prepared to explore ways in
                        which trade between our two countries could be increased. He did not like to
                        use the word “linkage”, but it was true nevertheless that a settlement of
                        these other matters would lead to increasing economic exchanges between us.
                        He therefore felt that if our political relations improved, increased trade
                        would follow naturally. This was in our interest as well as in the interest
                        of the Soviet Union.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The President said he believed we have covered most of the subjects that
                        required discussion. Referring to earlier discussions, he said that as
                        realists we knew and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew
                        that the question of the future of Europe, as well as the question of arms
                        control would depend upon whether the United States and the Soviet Union
                        could work out solutions aimed at strengthening peace. We recognized that
                        there are also a number of other factors threatening peace, but if the great
                        powers worked together, the peace could be kept. As practical men, we knew
                        that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Soviet understanding was essential
                        for the future of the world. He wanted to be sure that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would not leave with the impression
                        that the internal political situation in the United States would lead the
                        President to take a course opposite to the one he had followed until now. He
                        noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had made a
                        temperate speech before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> yesterday, and
                        said that he would make a temperate speech there tomorrow. Both Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were well acquainted with U.S.
                        politics. Both had been in this room before with President Johnson and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>. The President said
                        that he was in an unusual position. When he was elected to office <pb
                            n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0293"/>it was said that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would not be able to work
                        with the Soviet leaders because of his past background of anti-Communism. He
                        did not believe this to be so. More than any other President since World War
                        II, he felt that he could be flexible. He was prepared to be flexible in all
                        negotiations with the Soviet Union and wanted Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to realize that his approach would
                        not be doctrinaire on any subject, but, rather, pragmatic in all cases.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thanked the President for
                        his views and said that the President had correctly emphasized the role of
                        the Soviet Union and the United States as the two great powers responsible
                        for keeping peace in the world. The Soviet leadership was in full agreement
                        with the premise that the future of the world depended to an enormous extent
                        upon the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. If the
                        U.S. Government worked in the direction of peace, if it respected the
                        interests of the Soviet Union, it would find a vigorous, energetic and
                        determined partner in its search for ways to improve relations. This policy
                        of the Soviet Union was not new. It had been inviolable since the very
                        inception of the Soviet State. It was important, however, to stress the
                        concept of reciprocity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                        repeated this statement for emphasis. As for what the President had said
                        about the internal political situation influencing American foreign policy,
                        it was not for him to offer any evaluation of this influence. He repeated
                        however that his government sometimes had the impression that the U.S.
                        Government paid some tribute to the internal political situation in the U.S.
                        in the conduct of foreign affairs. If this was indeed so, it could only be
                        harmful to the relations between our two countries. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he was gratified to learn
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s speech before
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be temperate. One should be able
                        to rise above transitory phenomena and guide our two countries to work for
                        the interests of peace.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General,<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">The
                            President of the General Assembly was Dr. <persName>Edvard
                                Hambro</persName> of Norway ; the Secretary-General was U
                            Thant.</note> distinguished Chiefs of State and Heads of Government,
                        Your Excellencies the Foreign Ministers, and Delegates here assembled:</p>
                    <p>I am honored to greet the members of the United Nations on behalf of the
                        United States as we celebrate this organization's 25th anniversary. On this
                        historic occasion I wish to pay a special tribute to the founders of the
                        United Nations—to Secretary General U Thant and to all others who have
                        played indispensable roles in its success.</p>
                    <p>In considering an anniversary and in celebrating one, there is a temptation
                        to recount the accomplishments of the past, to gloss over the difficulties
                        of the present, and to speak in optimistic or even extravagant terms about
                        our hopes for the future.</p>
                    <p>This is too important a time and too important an occasion for such an
                        approach. The fate of more than 3-1/2 billion people today rests on the
                        realism and candor with which we approach the great issues of war and peace,
                        of security and progress, in this world that together we call home.</p>
                    <p>So I would like to speak with you today not ritualistically but
                        realistically; not of impossible dreams but of possible deeds.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations was born amid a great upwelling of hope that at last the
                        better nature of man would triumph. There was hope that Woodrow <persName
                            corresp="#p_WJH2">Wilson</persName>'s dream of half a century ago—that
                        the world's governments would join “in a permanent league in which they are
                        pledged to use their united power to maintain peace by maintaining right and
                        justice”—would at last be realized.</p>
                    <p>Some of those early hopes have been realized. Some have not.</p>
                    <p>The U.N. has achieved many successes in settling or averting conflicts.</p>
                    <p>The U.N. has achieved many successes in promoting economic development and in
                        fostering other areas of international cooperation, thanks to the work of
                        dedicated men and women all over the world.</p>
                    <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0295"/>
                    <p>These are matters that all the members of the United Nations can point to
                        with very great pride.</p>
                    <p>But we also know that the world today is not what the founders of the U.N.
                        hoped it would be 25 years ago. Cooperation among nations leaves much to be
                        desired. The goal of the peaceful settlement of disputes is too often
                        breached. The great central issue of our time—the question of whether the
                        world as a whole is to live at peace—has not been resolved.</p>
                    <p>This central issue turns in large part on the relations among the great
                        nuclear powers. Their strength imposes on them special responsibilities of
                        restraint and wisdom. The issue of war and peace cannot be solved unless we
                        in the United States and the Soviet Union demonstrate both the will and the
                        capacity to put our relationship on a basis consist-ent with the aspirations
                        of mankind.</p>
                    <p>Commenting here today on U.S.-Soviet relationships, I see no point in
                        responding in kind to traditional cold war rhetoric. The facts of the recent
                        past speak for themselves. An effort to score debating points is not the way
                        to advance the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>In fact, one of the paramount problems of our time is that we must transcend
                        the old patterns of power politics in which nations sought to exploit every
                        volatile situation for their own advantage, or to squeeze the maximum
                        advantage for themselves out of every negotiation.</p>
                    <p>In today's world, and especially where the nuclear powers are involved, such
                        policies invite the risk of confrontations and could spell disaster for all.
                        The changes in the world since World War II have made more compelling than
                        ever the central idea behind the United Nations: that individual nations
                        must be ready at last to take a farsighted and a generous view. The
                        profoundest national interest of our time—for every nation—is not immediate
                        gain but the preservation of peace.</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons the world had such high hopes for the United Nations at
                        the time of its founding was that the United States and the Soviet Union had
                        fought together as allies in World War II. We cooperated in bringing the
                        U.N. into being. There were hopes that this cooperation would continue.</p>
                    <p>It did not continue, and much of the world's—and the U.N.'s—most grievous
                        troubles since have stemmed from that fact of history.</p>
                    <p>It is not my intention to point fingers of blame, but simply to discuss the
                        facts of international life as they are.</p>
                    <p>We all must recognize that the United States and the Soviet Union have very
                        profound and fundamental differences.</p>
                    <p>It would not be realistic, therefore, to suggest that our differences can be
                        eliminated merely by better personal relationships between the <pb n="276"
                            xml:id="pg_276" facs="0296"/>heads of our governments. Such a view would
                        slight the seriousness of our disagreements.</p>
                    <p>Genuine progress in our relations calls for specifics, not merely
                        atmospherics. A true détente is built by a series of actions, not by a
                        superficial shift in the apparent mood.</p>
                    <p>It would not be realistic to suggest that all we need to improve our
                        relations is “better mutual understanding.”</p>
                    <p>Understanding is necessary. But we do understand one another well enough to
                        know that our differences are real, and that in many respects we will
                        continue to be competitors. Our task is to keep that competition peaceful,
                        to make it creative.</p>
                    <p>Neither would it be realistic to deny that power has a role in our relations.
                        Power is a fact of international life. Our mutual obligation is to
                        discipline that power, to seek together with other nations to ensure that it
                        is used to maintain peace, not to threaten the peace.</p>
                    <p>I state these obstacles to peace because they are the challenge that must be
                        overcome.</p>
                    <p>Despite the deep differences between ourselves and the Soviet Union, there
                        are four great factors that provide a basis for a common interest in working
                        together to contain and to reduce those differences.</p>
                    <p>The first of these factors is at once the most important and the most
                        obvious. Neither of us wants a nuclear exchange that would cost the lives of
                        tens of millions of people. Thus, we have a powerful common interest in
                        avoiding a nuclear confrontation.</p>
                    <p>The second of these factors is the enormous cost of arms. Certainly we both
                        should welcome the opportunity to reduce the burden, to use our resources
                        for building rather than destroying.</p>
                    <p>The third factor is that we both are major industrial powers, which at
                        present have very little trade or commercial contact with one another. It
                        would clearly be in the economic self-interest of each of us if world
                        conditions would permit us to increase trade and contact between us.</p>
                    <p>The fourth factor is the global challenge of economic and social development.
                        The pressing economic and social needs around the world can give our
                        competition a creative direction.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in these four matters, we have substantial mutual incentives to find
                        ways of working together despite our continuing difference of views on other
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>It was in this spirit that I announced, on taking office, that the policy of
                        the United States would be to move from an era of confrontation to one of
                        negotiation.</p>
                    <p>This is a spirit that we hope will dominate the talks between our two
                        countries on the limitation of strategic arms.</p>
                    <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0297"/>
                    <p>There is no greater contribution which the United States and the Soviet Union
                        together could make than to limit the world's capacity for
                        self-destruction.</p>
                    <p>This would reduce the danger of war. And it would enable us to devote more of
                        our resources—abroad as well as at home—to assisting in the constructive
                        works of economic development and in peaceful progress: in Africa, for
                        example, where so many nations have gained independence and dignity during
                        the life of the United Nations; in Asia, with its rich diversity of cultures
                        and peoples; and in Latin America, where the United States has special bonds
                        of friendship and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Despite our many differences, the United States and the Soviet Union have
                        managed ever since World War II to avoid direct conflicts. But history
                        shows—as the tragic experience of World War I indicates—that great powers
                        can be drawn into conflict without their intending it by wars between
                        smaller nations.</p>
                    <p>The Middle East is a place today where local rivalries are intense, where the
                        vital interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are both involved.
                        Quite obviously, the primary responsibility for achieving a peaceful
                        settlement in the Middle East rests on the nations there themselves. But in
                        this region in particular, it is imperative that the two major powers
                        conduct themselves so as to strengthen the forces of peace rather than to
                        strengthen the forces of war.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that we and the Soviet Union join in efforts toward avoiding
                        war in the Middle East, and also toward developing a climate in which the
                        nations of the Middle East will learn to live and let live. It is essential
                        not only in the interest of the people of the Middle East themselves, but
                        also because the alternative could be a confrontation with disastrous
                        consequences for the Middle East, for our nations, and for the whole
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we urge the continuation of the cease-fire and the creation of
                        confidence in which peace efforts can go forward.</p>
                    <p>In the world today we are at a crossroads. We can follow the old way, playing
                        the traditional game of international relations, but at ever-increasing
                        risk. Everyone will lose. No one will gain. Or we can take a new road.</p>
                    <p>I invite the leaders of the Soviet Union to join us in taking that new
                        road—to join in a peaceful competition, not in the accumulation of arms but
                        in the dissemination of progress; not in the building of missiles but in
                        waging a winning war against hunger and disease and human misery in our own
                        countries and around the globe.</p>
                    <p>Let us compete in elevating the human spirit, in fostering respect for law
                        among nations, in promoting the works of peace. In this kind of competition,
                        no one loses and everyone gains.</p>

                    <p>Here at the United Nations, there are many matters of major and immediate
                        global concern on which nations even when they are competitors have a mutual
                        interest in working together as part of the community of nations.</p>
                    <p>In approaching these matters each of us represented here, in our national
                        interest as leaders and in our self-interest as human beings, must take into

                    <p>Last month I proposed a major transformation of the American foreign aid

                                70</ref>.</note> A major thrust of my proposals is to place larger
                        shares of American assistance under international agencies, in particular
                        the World Bank, the U.N. Development Program, the Regional Development
                        Banks. We seek to promote greater multilateral cooperation and the pooling
                        of contributions through impartial international bodies. We are also
                        encouraging developing countries to participate more fully in the
                        determination of their needs. Within the inter-American system, for example,
                        new mechanisms have been established for a continuing and frank
                        dialogue.</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of the U.N.'s second development decade, we shall strive to do
                        our full and fair share in helping others to help themselves—through
                        government assistance, through encouraging efforts by private industry,
                        through fostering a spirit of international volunteer service.</p>

                    <p>Disagreements between the major powers in the past have contributed to this

                        decisively to keep the peace. This means strengthening both its capacity for
                        peacemaking, settling disputes before they lead to armed conflict, and its
                        capacity for peacekeeping, containing and ending conflicts that have broken

                        support the recent recommendations of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs,
                        to take the first step toward giving them substance by establishing a United
                        Nations Fund for Drug Control. And I urge all governments to support a
                        strengthened narcotics treaty that would govern all production by
                        restricting it solely to medical and scientific purposes. The United States
                        has already circulated such a proposal for consideration at the next session

                    <p>In this assembly last year, I called for international action to put an end
                        to air piracy. This problem has grown even more acute. Recent events have
                        dramatically underscored its gravity and also underscored the fact that no
                        nation is immune from it. The United States has taken a number of steps on
                        its own initiative. But this issue requires effective international actions,
                        including measures to permit <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0300"/>the
                        suspension of airline services to countries where such piracy is
                        condoned.</p>
                    <p>The increase of kidnappings of accredited diplomats is a closely related
                        matter that should urgently concern every member of this Assembly.</p>

                    <p>In an address earlier this month proposing a cease-fire in Indochina, I

                        prisoners of war and innocent victims of the conflict. This is not a
                        political or a military issue. It is a humanitarian issue. The United
                        Nations should register its concern about the treatment of prisoners of war
                        and press all adversaries in this conflict, indeed in every conflict, to
                        honor the Geneva Convention.</p>
                    <p>I have mentioned some of the problems on which the United Nations can—if its
                        members have the will—make substantial progress. There are many others. I
                        urge this body, and the U.N. system, to move ahead rapidly with effective
                        action. And as we move ahead, the United States will do its full share.</p>
                    <p>The United States came to its present position of world power without either
                        seeking the power or wanting the responsibility. We shall meet that
                        responsibility as well as we can.</p>
                    <p>We shall not be so pious or so hypocritical as to pretend that we have not
                        made mistakes, or that we have no national interests of our own which we
                        intend to protect.</p>
                    <p>But we can with complete honesty say that we maintain our strength to keep
                        the peace, not to threaten the peace. The power of the United States will be
                        used to defend freedom, never to destroy freedom.</p>
                    <p>What we seek is not a Pax Americana, not an American Century, but rather a
                        structure of stability and progress that will enable each nation, large and
                        small, to chart its own course, to make its own way without outside
                        interference, without intimidation, without domination by ourselves or any
                        other nation. The United States fully understands and respects the policy of
                        nonalignment, and we welcome joint efforts, such as the recent meeting in
                        Lusaka, to further international cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We seek good relations with all the people of the world. We respect the right

                            <item>—that each individual has a human right to that same recognition

                    </p>
                    <p>As the United Nations begins its next quarter century, it does so richer in
                        experience, sobered in its understanding of what it can do and what it
                        cannot, what should be expected and what should not.</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of this 25th anniversary, the United States will go the extra
                        mile in doing our part toward making the U.N. succeed. We look forward to
                        working together—working together with all nations represented here in going
                        beyond the mere containment of crises to building a structure of peace that
                        promotes justice as well as assuring stability that will last because all
                        have a stake in its lasting.</p>
                    <p>I remember very vividly today my visit to India in 1953 when I met for the
                        first time one of the world's greatest statesmen, Prime Minister Nehru. I
                        asked him, as he considered that great country, with its enormous problems,
                        what was its greatest need? He replied: The greatest need for India, and for
                        any newly independent country, is for 25 years of peace—a generation of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>In Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe—in
                        all the 74 nations I have now visited, one thing I have found is that
                        whatever their differences in race or religion or political systems,
                        whatever their customs, whatever their condition, the people of the world
                        want peace.</p>
                    <p>So let the guns fall silent and stay silent.</p>
                    <p>In Southeast Asia, let us agree to a cease-fire and negotiate a peace.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, let us hold to the cease-fire and build a peace.</p>
                    <p>Through arms control agreements, let us invest our resources in the
                        development that nourishes peace.</p>
                    <p>Across this planet let us attack the ills that threaten peace.</p>
                    <p>In the untapped oceans of water and space, let us harvest in peace.</p>
                    <p>In our personal relations and in our international relations, let us display
                        the mutual respect that fosters peace.</p>
                    <p>Above all, let us, as leaders of the world, reflect in our actions what our
                        own people feel. Let us do what our own people need. Let us consider the
                        world interest—the people's interest—in all that we do.</p>
                    <p>Since the birth of the United Nations, for the first time in this century the
                        world's people have lived through 25 years without a world war.</p>
                    <p>Let us resolve together that the second quarter century of the United Nations
                        shall offer the world what its people yearn for, and what they deserve: a
                        world without any war, a full generation of peace.</p>

                    <p>Romanian President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Nicolae Ceausescu</persName>
                        came to Washington on October 26, 1970, for a 2-day official visit following
                        his participation in the 25th anniversary session of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. During the course of a
                        conversation between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        and President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> in the Oval
                        Office of the White House on October 26, <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                            >Ceausescu</persName> expressed the hope that improved relations between
                        the United States and Romania would serve as a model for relations between
                        large and small countries as well as between those with differing social
                        systems:</p>
                    <p>“The President responded by saying that this is what the United States has in
                        mind with countries like Romania and Yugoslavia—that this kind of
                        cooperation can be the basis for cooperation between countries with
                        different systems, especially having in mind that this is a cooperation
                        without strings, with no intention to influence the internal affairs of the
                        other country.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also addressed
                        concerns that U.S. efforts to develop a modus vivendi with the Soviet Union
                        would be undertaken at the expense of countries such as Romania :</p>
                    <p>“The President then said there was one point he would like to emphasize.
                        After his talk to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, some observers in
                        the press had speculated that he was committed to develop with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a condominium to the detriment of other
                        countries. The President continued by saying that he wished to state
                        American policy quite directly. He had had a long talk with <persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>. There would be other discussions
                        in the future. The purpose of these discussions with the Soviets would be to
                        explore areas where the United States and the Soviet Union could reduce the
                        level of world conflict and the burden of arms. Under no circumstances will
                        the direction of any discussions be toward a result where the independence
                        of any country, especially any country in Eastern or Western Europe will be
                        compromised. The future of each country in Europe must be determined by
                        itself not by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor by the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>“That is why we will continue, the President added, in the future to attempt
                        to explore ways we can talk with the People's Republic of China again
                        because it is necessary to have avenues of communication with all nations in
                        the world if we are going to have a world safe from the danger of a nuclear
                        war.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> reiterated this assurance later
                        in the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“The President assured <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>,
                        however, that under no circumstances would the United States cooperate with
                        any country, including <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0303"/>the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, at the expense of another country or
                        American relations with that country. This would be contrary to American
                        tradition. He could also assure <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                            >Ceausescu</persName> that the American position was clear, namely that
                        the United States wants good relations with all countries of Eastern Europe.
                        It rejects the idea that two great powers should sit down at a summit
                        meeting and determine the future of smaller countries. That is wrong and the
                        United States will not proceed on such a course.”</p>
                    <p>Near the end of the conversation, discussion turned to the desire of the
                        United States to improve relations with China, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> expressed his appreciation for
                        Romania's efforts to facilitate expanded contacts between the United States
                        and China :</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> remarked that Romania has
                        especially cordial relations with China. Since his last meeting with the
                        President, there have been several fairly high level delegations which have
                        visited China and discussed many subjects including relations between China
                        and the United States and China's presence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. It is important to note from these discussions the point
                        that China desires to have improved relations with the United States and is
                        ready at any moment to occupy its place in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, including this year. This morning, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> added, he had just received a
                        message from <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> on behalf
                        of the Chinese leadership, thanking him for the clear Romanian pronouncement
                        at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in favor of China's taking its
                        place there. He believes that the United States should take the first steps
                        in that direction, especially after the Cambodian events. Such steps could
                        open the way to increased contacts with the Chinese. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> then said he must tell the
                        President frankly that the Chinese have some of the same feelings of
                        concern, some of the same doubts as those he had mentioned earlier regarding
                        problems being solved by only two large countries.</p>
                    <p>“The President commented that the other side of the coin was that the Soviets
                        do not look with much sympathy on American moves to normalize relations with
                        China.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> replied why should they not.
                        Otherwise things would be impossible. The Romanians have told the Soviets
                        more than once that there should be good relations between China and the
                        U.S. A lack of understanding of this problem will not help solve it.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said he did not believe
                        that an improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations would be directed against the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or others. He noted that he had
                        had lots of discussions with Chinese leaders and knew how they thought. He
                        was convinced that they are not pursuing such a goal.</p>
                    <p>“The President stated that American policy is one of wanting friendly
                        relations with both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and eventually
                        with Communist China. We do not intend to play one against another. Our
                        desire is to have independent relations with each, not directed against the
                        other. <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0304"/>The President added that
                        this seems to be President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>'s
                        viewpoint as well. He then remarked that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>'s continued role as a peacemaker
                        is very useful in regard to U.S.-Chinese relations. He can talk to both
                        parties which is very helpful and in the end, in the President's opinion,
                        this will produce results.” (Memorandum of conversation, October 26, 1970,

                    <p>The luncheon opened with a general discussion about the student movement. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that when he
                        met with the students around the time of the Cambodian operation he did so
                        on the condition that they return after the summer or in six months to
                        discuss it and other matters of foreign policy again. By and large the
                        result has been that the students' interest has petered out. In fact it has
                        now become necessary for us to take the initiative to encourage students to
                        come down. The groups that we now have are no longer protest groups and they
                        are asking more serious questions. The earlier groups were characterized by
                        incredible ignorance. A good example is the question that <persName
                            corresp="#p_SWL1">Safire</persName> asked them, that if the
                        Administration did certain things would they be satisfied. When they said
                        yes, he revealed that these steps had already been taken, but they were not
                        satisfied. The same ploy was used by the Vice President on <gloss
                            target="#t_TV1">TV</gloss> a short time later.</p>
                    <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0305"/>
                    <p>The students seem to only know the standard questions and after they had
                        said, “What about Cambodia ?” and one has replied, “yes, what about
                        Cambodia”?, they did not know what to say. They seem quite bored with
                        probing into the reasons behind decisions, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Donovan</persName> mentioned Bator's<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2"
                            >Francis M. Bator, professor of political economy at the <persName>John

                            Deputy Special Assistant to President
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>.</note> complaint about the coverage of the
                        visit of the Harvard professors and Sidey explained that this involved their
                        disagreement with the article he had written stating that one of the implied
                        messages of their visit was that in view of the recent Cambodian actions and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s part in it, he would
                        no longer be welcome back at Harvard. The group claimed that they had never
                        said this and Sidey agreed but said it was implicit in their coming down and
                        he was not questioning their integrity but their judgment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained how the
                        meeting took place and that he was completely unaware of their purpose in
                        coming. They opened the meeting by stating that everything he said would be
                        completely on the record. As a result he could not really give any
                        explanations. Many have since felt somewhat guilty of their role because
                        they acted at a time of considerable emotion. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also explained that he had since
                        been in touch with just about all of the members of the group and he thought
                        their communications were relatively open in spite of the confrontation.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is an exchange concerning problems coloring the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's dealings with
                        Congress on foreign policy issues.]</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Donovan</persName>: In the last ten years do you think there
                        had been any constructive public opinion intervention in the formulation of
                        foreign policy?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The whole debate on
                        commitments has indirectly been somewhat helpful. The problem is that the
                        debate has concentrated on our commitments and not our interests. It is
                        really our interests that should get us involved, not our commitments. The
                        real debate therefore should be on what and where are our interests, and
                        only then should we look at our commitments. The whole public debate on
                        commitments, however, has at least focused our attention in the right
                        direction. In Vietnam there never was an adequate analysis of what our
                        strategic interests were. The theory was that Vietnam was a test case for
                            <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0306"/>what appeared to be centrally
                        directed guerrilla wars; if we could stop the war there, we could stop it
                        worldwide. There was no real examination of our interests vis-à-vis the
                        Soviets or the Chinese. If LBJ had known that the one division he committed
                        would grow to 550,000 men he would never have done what he did.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Steele</persName>: It seems that in the past many
                        commitments were made simply by the military in the field. How do you look
                        at the making of our commitments now?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our procedure now is
                        much more formal. One of the jobs of the Washington Special Action Group is
                        to develop contingency plans which have an integrated
                        political/diplomatic/military scenario even down to the point of preparing
                        draft cables on what we should say to particular countries. And more
                        importantly, we examine where we will be two years after a certain plan is
                        followed. This procedure was first followed after the shoot-down of the
                        EC-121.</p>
                    <p>One of the discoveries made since assuming this position has been the
                        realization that it is not simply enough to be able to identify a problem.
                        This is what I thought was the objective when I was a consultant on the
                        outside. The problem I now realize is to get time to address a particular
                        issue. Our commitment to Ethiopia is an example of a situation where we have
                        not yet had time to give it the attention we should.</p>
                    <p>One additional practice which we have instituted is to formally review our
                        major programs and reassess our covert operations on a periodic basis. If
                        this is not done from time to time, programs have a habit of just going on
                        even though the initial reason for their implementation may have
                        disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Donovan</persName>: Who do you think really carries the
                        responsibility for understanding and implementing a new direction in our
                        foreign policy?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The answer would
                        seem to be the “establishment”, whatever that means. Specifically, it would
                        seem to be those who are concerned about our foreign policy, who have an
                        influence on the media and who have the means to form a consensus of opinion
                        in the country. These seem to be the ones who carry the responsibility for
                        understanding and giving us a new direction, but one of the more disturbing
                        aspects of the Cambodian operation was the total collapse of the
                        establishment at a time when it should have stood up. One can understand the
                        students' reaction, but it is not as easy to excuse the establishment and
                        its leaders for attacking the President and the system on such an issue.
                        They should have known better and have realized that, regardless of what
                        they said, the only one that could bring the war in Vietnam to an end was
                        the President and that it was not in the best interests of the country to
                        seek to destroy it [him?].</p>
                    <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0307"/>
                    <p>It is surprising how preoccupied outsiders are in operational matters. On
                        such matters the government official can invariably outpoint his outside
                        opponent, not because he is brighter but simply because he has more
                        information at his disposal. What the outsider should concentrate on doing
                        is asking the right questions, then the government official can try to get
                        the answers. If they are wrong that is his fault, not the fault of the
                        questioner. One of the great dangers with trying to deal with such a high
                        number of issues and problems is that the urgent ones seem to displace the
                        more important ones. It is a constant fight to find time to address those
                        questions which have long range implications. The bureaucracies also do not
                        help one in this connection since they almost always give us three options
                        in which the first and third are the extremes and the second is what they
                        are doing or what they propose to do.</p>
                    <p>To answer your questions directly, yes, the formulation of informed and
                        reasoned public opinion is needed very badly.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Donovan</persName>: How many people would you say in a
                        country are reasonably well informed, 100,000, 200,000, 10,000?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The number of people
                        who cause senior people in the government to think would be more restricted.
                        We do care about the League of Women Voters in Iowa, but the groups that I
                        think would be the opinion molders would be various foreign relations
                        committees around the country such as the Council on Foreign Relations. The
                        problem with such a group as the CFR is that the membership must really be
                        changed since they are all thinking on the basis of post World War II 1940's
                        assumptions. McCloy<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">

                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Steele</persName>: What is your present analysis of the
                        “cold war”?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In June, despite
                        Cambodia, it was fairly optimistic. We had the likelihood of progress in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, a visit to the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                            >Kosygin</persName> in connection with the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> anniversary and an apparent willingness to keep the Middle
                        East quiet. We never even anticipated a problem in Cuba. In the middle of
                        June, however, there seemed to be a sudden shift and the flexibility that we
                        had earlier experienced disappeared. This was at about the same time as the
                        Soviet decision to delay their Party Congress.</p>
                    <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0308"/>
                    <p>There are three possible explanations for this change: <list>
                            <item>—First, that it was part of a master plan that each one of these
                                decisions which seemed to be gratuitously aggressive was made as
                                part of an integrated scheme.</item>
                            <item>—A second explanation would be that the leaders are so grossly
                                incompetent that they made these decisions on an ad hoc basis simply
                                without studying the relation of one to the other.</item>
                            <item>—Thirdly, it can be explained as the outgrowth of a collective
                                leadership in which there is no dominant personality and which has
                                become divided into divisive factions.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Each faction is seeking to outdo the other, no one has the power of a veto
                        but neither does anyone have the power to make a generous deal with the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which might produce some long-term
                        advantages. It is entirely possible that the Middle East actions were
                        decided by one group, the Cuban ones by another and the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> ones by still another.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, notwithstanding the element
                        of flattery, has told me that the problem is that the Kremlin does not have
                        an office such as an advisor for national security affairs which can pull
                        together all the various points of view. It is equivalent to each of our
                        Cabinet members having access to all cables and papers. The result is
                        obviously that there is more likely to be discordant decisions. And this,
                        incidentally, is also what Tito believes to be the case.</p>
                    <p>Q. Do you think the cold war is over?</p>
                    <p>A. By all reason it should be over but it obviously is not. It would seem
                        that the Soviet [ Union] would realize that it is to its advantage to deal
                        with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> since he has far more
                        flexibility in reaching agreement with them than either <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> or Johnson had. For example, in
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> or in the Middle East if they
                        would pull themselves together and forget about gigging us and trying to
                        take advantage of every tactical situation, we could have progress. But it
                        must be admitted that so far in this Administration there has been no
                        conversation resulting in a fundamental agreement.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Mader</persName>: Are not these divisive factions also at
                        the Politburo level?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes; that is exactly
                        where they are and where they are most apparent. In fact, it would not seem
                        to be unusual for one faction to make a deal with another faction in order
                        to get reciprocal support from their divisions.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Nichol</persName>: How would you apply this analysis of the
                        Soviet regime to its actions on Berlin?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would seem that
                        what West Germany is doing—their Ostpolitik—is in the best interests of the
                        Soviet Union. The Soviet reaction is therefore puzzling. With regard to the
                        question of access to Berlin, there is no doubt that the East German regime
                        is gaining increased sovereignty over the routes. And even if an access
                        agreement <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0309"/>is worked out, there is
                        no end to the harassments an imaginative bureaucracy can think up. And they
                        can even be legal. Therefore, if the Soviets wanted to put West Germany in a
                        fairly tough spot, it would seem that they would give some concessions in
                        order to facilitate an agreement on Berlin thereby removing the West German
                        precondition to ratification of their treaty with the Soviets. But it may be
                        that the Soviets think that they can get their ratification without any
                        Berlin concessions. It may also be that the Soviets believe that no West
                        German government can take responsibility for not ratifying the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Nichol</persName>: Will we make it easier or tougher for
                        West Germany to ratify the treaty with the Russians?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As long as the
                        agreement on Berlin is confined to the question of access, we will go as far
                        as the Germans want us to. But we cannot be more German than the Germans. We
                        have not been tough on Berlin, the comments of Ehmke<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d80fn5">Horst Ehmke, Head of the Federal Chancellery and
                            Minister for Special Tasks, Federal Republic of Germany.</note>
                        notwithstanding. We will not hold up the Berlin agreement unless it is a
                        patent turnover to the other side. We will not push Germany into a soft
                        position. It should be remembered that it was the Germans who started the
                        negotiations. They said that they had a deal with the Soviets to get
                        improvements on Berlin in exchange for their Ostpolitik. But as yet, we have
                        not seen any sign of such a deal.</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Mader</persName>: How would you describe your present
                        concern about Cuba ?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a fact that
                        the Soviets constructed a submarine facility in Cienfuegos such as we have
                        at Holy Loch. It was done with a maximum of deception and speed in a little
                        over three weeks.</p>
                    <p>We challenged them along the line that we knew what they were doing but
                        without saying it precisely. We said if this facility turns into a military
                        base, we would not be pleased. The Soviets then came back and said
                        specifically they were not building a military base. The 1962
                            Understandings<note n="6" xml:id="d80fn6">An apparent reference to the
                            exchange of letters between President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1"

                            letter of October 27, the “understandings” involved the dismantling and
                            removal from Cuba of “all weapon systems capable of offensive use”
                            combined with an assurance that the Soviet Union would not introduce
                            such systems into Cuba in the future. In return, the United States
                            agreed to lift the naval quarantine in effect and offer assurances
                            against an invasion of Cuba. Khrushchev accepted <persName

                            removal of weapons from Cuba and on the unwillingness of the <persName

                        be indicative of the petty type of leadership that the Soviets now have, but
                        the positive result is that the 1962 Understandings have been extended to
                        cover the submarine facility. If the tender services nuclear subs, it is
                        breaking the agreement. If it does not tend the subs, then it is no good to
                        them. The question here is why do they continue to horse around. The way
                        that they are putting the tender in here, pulling out something else there,
                        putting the tender back over here does not give one confidence that he is
                        dealing with big people. If they do set up a facility and it operates
                        sufficiently, it can increase their patrolling by 35 per cent. The thing
                        they do not seem to realize, though, is if they do get away with a partial
                        establishment of a base, they are hurting our confidence in them in relation
                        to other more significant areas of agreement</p>
                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Mader</persName>: Do we have any confidence in them now at
                        all?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks, we can still see areas for
                        progress. The reason here is that the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                        preparations were so thorough that if any agreement is reached it will be so
                        precise that there will probably be about a two-year period in which to
                        react to any violation. We can therefore go ahead regardless of how they
                        behave elsewhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>We would have liked to have been known as the Administration that developed a
                        new international system not based on rivalry but which took into account
                        the abyss before which we stand as nations.</p>
                    <p>It may be that after the Party Congress next year there will be a
                        crystallization of leadership and more likelihood of agreement. But, we must
                        realize that the Soviet leadership is a bunch of thugs. Krushchev's

                        account of Beria's downfall are good examples of this brutal system.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets also have the China problem which is both geopolitical and
                        ideological. They want to free their Western rear so that they can focus
                        more on China, but when they do so, it complicates their ideological problem
                        since the Chinese will say that they are not the “true church” because they
                        have become soft on the West. In this sense, a détente in Europe is a
                        God-send for the Soviets. Europe will protect their rear (e.g., Pompidou's
                        visit, Brandt's Ostpolitik, disintegration on the Italian political scene)
                        while they continue to maintain a stiff attitude toward us and thereby lay
                        claim as “the true church.”</p>

                    <p>This, however, in my opinion is an illusion. For the same reason that a
                        détente is important, it does not bring about anything permanent. It only
                        defers decisions for three to four years. Hence, Ostpolitik may indirectly
                        contribute to increased tensions with the <gloss target="#t_US1"

                    <p>Q. Mr. <persName>Donovan</persName>: Is there any likelihood that there will
                        be a warm-up of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Chinese relations?</p>
                    <p>A. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It seems that the
                        quickest way for us to get the Soviets' attention is to put out the word
                        that we are restudying the China question. It is indeed worrisome to Moscow
                        whether we will develop a dialogue with the Chinese. We have floated all
                        sorts of signals to the Chinese, but as yet, we really don't know how to get
                        in touch with them. In Warsaw, the Chinese have enjoyed trying to drive the
                        Soviets crazy by various approaches to us. But the Chinese are really trying
                        to play the same game as the Soviets; namely, to first isolate us and then
                        deal with the other. Our China strategy has been both to develop a dialogue
                        with them for its own sake and then to have a counterweight with the
                        Soviets.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> used the occasion of a
                        visit to White House by Israeli Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM8"
                            >Moshe Dayan</persName> on December 11, 1970, to define one of his
                        administration's fundamental objectives in the Middle East. During a
                        conversation in the Oval Office that began at 3:30 p.m.:</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that his
                        policy had been, from the outset, to counterbalance Soviet power in the
                        Middle East. He was confident that the Arabs alone would be no match for
                        Israel's military. For this reason, it was his concern that the Soviets
                        recognize that the U.S. would guarantee Israel's survival. He had followed
                        this policy since the first days of his Administration, both in public and
                        in private contacts with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>“The President added that U.S. actions during the Jordan crisis were designed
                        to demonstrate this point. The movement of the Sixth Fleet was ordered to
                        convey to the Soviet Union that the U.S. would not stand idly by in this
                        situation. The President also complimented the Israeli Government for the
                        readiness measures which they took and which were also an operative factor
                        in de-escalating the situation.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> made it clear later in the
                        conversation that he expected that U.S. economic and military support for
                        Israel would provide the security to enable Israel to participate in good
                        faith in the effort to find a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli
                        dispute:</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that he would
                        never mislead the Prime Minister or the people of Israel. He intended to be
                        forthright and honest and make no promises that he would not deliver or
                        provide any assurances that he would not keep. He stated that from time to
                        time friends would disagree on particulars but that the essence of
                        international friendship was mutual trust. He trusted Prime Minister Meir
                        and anticipated that she shared this trust in him.</p>
                    <p>“The President added that it was quite evident to him that the American
                        people anticipated that Israel would move to the conference table under the
                        auspices of Jarring. He pointed out that this was expected in light of the
                        $500 million assistance being provided by this government which he hoped
                        would soon be approved by the Congress. He stated that it was important that
                        the youth of Israel be permitted to apply their great talents, ingenuity and
                        industry to peaceful pursuits and that for this reason the time was right to
                        enter into the talks. He pointed out further that Israel at this time could
                        move with an air of confidence since the military balance would be
                        re-established through the current aid package and since the overall
                        international environment dictated such a move. He emphasized that all
                        responsible U.S. officials were of one mind on this.” (National Archives,

                    <p>At a meeting with his senior staff in the Pentagon on December 14, 1970,
                        Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> discussed
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s desire for a new
                        strategic concept:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> said we still face
                        tremendous problems in having everyone fully understand our national
                        strategy. This is of major concern to him. We will have tremendous problems
                        in preserving our present force capabilities and to gain or create options
                        to add to our capabilities. We have cut the Defense budget as far as we can.
                        The President has expressed a desire for a new strategic concept that is
                        tied to his foreign <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0313"/>policy
                        objectives and that is not necessarily tied to detailed specifics on forces
                        and weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> said his basic
                        desire in responding to the President's desire is to develop a strategy
                        comprehended by a majority of the country and one which both House and
                        Senate can support. We must recognize realities, protect the <gloss

                        for increased flexibility in the short-term, and lay the foundation now for
                        strengthening forces of all major categories during the next 5 years. He has
                        put together a new concept paper linked closely to the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, with its emphasis on
                        increased strength for air and sea forces as well as the emphasis in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>-95 on maintaining our ground commitment
                        in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He will issue this paper this week
                        as tentative strategic guidance for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973.
                        He will also submit it to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and <gloss

                    <p>“It is important to bear in mind as we finalize the strategic guidance that
                        what we are trying to do is have a strategy that can be understood by the
                        American people and the Congress and which at the same time will give us the
                        necessary flexibility in operating under the kind of budget situation that
                        we have now and will have in the future. Naturally, there won't be complete
                        agreement by everyone on the strategy. It has not had the major staffing
                        many of the papers in the building have had. It is important to have a
                        strategy that can be understood if we are to have the options and
                        capabilities we need during the upcoming period.” (Minutes of Secretary of

                    <p>On December 17, 1970, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                        met a number of reporters from the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> in
                        the offices of the newspaper. In the course of responding to a variety of
                        questions relating to foreign policy, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> addressed the complex problems posed by tensions
                        in the Middle East, and the likelihood that a stalemate in the Arab-Israeli
                        dispute was “inevitable”:</p>
                    <p>“There are three basic issues when one looks at the Middle East. First, one
                        can look at it solely as an Arab-Israeli problem; secondly, one can focus on
                        the significance of the Soviet presence there; or thirdly, one can also
                        focus on the nature of the Arab states, their autonomy. Our objective has
                        been to try to get each of these issues in phase with each other. Some
                        however think that only the first issue is of any consequence and it is
                        therefore the key. They believe that if it can be solved, the rest will fall
                        in place.</p>
                    <p>“We believe however that each of these issues is related; that there are a
                        number of problems which have to be resolved or at least addressed. A good
                        example is the likelihood of a stalemate once negotiations are started.</p>
                    <p>“In fact, stalemate is really inevitable. It seems to be an obsession in
                        Washington to focus only on the next step. One of the things that surprised
                        me most when I came here was the singlemindedness with which the immediate
                        step was addressed and the lack of attention paid to what was going to
                        happen next. Starting negotiations is of second order priority; breaking the
                        stalemate is really the critical issue. Examples of the questions we should
                        address are: With whom are we going to deal when there is a stalemate? Is it
                        going to be in a four-power forum, two-power forum, the Security Council at

                    <p>Like last year, this year's report emphasizes the purposes and objectives of
                        our foreign policy rather than a mere recital of events. It is designed to
                        stress not so much what we have done, but why we have done it. The major
                        thrust of this report is that conditions which have changed since World War
                        II call for a new type of American leadership, rather than an abdication of
                        leadership. It pictures our basic task to be the enlisting of the resources
                        and concepts of other nations to help build a stable peace.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have been following a tentative outline which looks as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">—Introduction</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>This briefly recalls the historical changes that have taken place which call
                        for a new foreign policy: stronger friends and allies; a shift in military
                        relationships from U.S. predominance to relative equality; the fragmentation
                        of the Communist world; and new technological problems and challenges which
                        call for world cooperation. The implications for our policy are sketched: a
                        partnership that enlists greater contributions from others; a new doctrine
                        for our strategic and general forces purposes; dealing in different ways
                        with various Communist countries; and cooperating with friends and
                        adversaries alike to meet global issues such as pollution, space and the
                        seabeds.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>This chapter spells out the core of the new foreign policy: the philosophy of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and its theme of
                        partnership: It discusses <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0316"/>its
                        application to security and development and its invocation of the ideas as
                        well as the resources of other nations. A basic theme is that the greater
                        the involvement of other nations in helping to build peace, the greater
                        their stake in preserving the peace. There is emphasis on the need for
                        careful application of our changed approach so as to instill confidence
                        abroad and evoke domestic support for a continuing positive American
                        role.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>This principal section of the report explains the application of the new
                        foreign policy to the various regions of the world. In these chapters we
                        generally (1) state our basic approach, (2) illustrate how this approach has
                        been applied with major events and achievements, and (3) list the basic
                        agenda for the future. Among the major chapters in this section are Europe,
                        the Middle East and Indochina.</p>

                    <p>This section will focus on the two ways of enhancing national security,
                        through a strong defense and through arms control. There are individual
                        chapters on strategic forces (including a discussion on sufficiency and the
                        growing Soviet strength); general purpose forces (the need to tailor our
                        conventional forces to those of our allies); security assistance (the need
                        to help our friends make the transition to greater self-sufficiency) and
                        arms control (with emphasis on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>).</p>

                    <p>Our overall approach to the Soviet Union is treated in this section although,
                        of course, our specific dealings are sprinkled throughout the report. The
                        emphasis is on the need for mutual respect for legitimate interests,
                        concrete negotiations, and focusing on broader interests rather than
                        maneuvering for tactical advantages. It reflects many of the themes in your
                        United Nations speech. A brief chapter on China states our readiness to deal
                        constructively with Peking while firmly maintaining our commitment to
                        Taiwan.</p>

                        ideology, such as pollution, the exploration of space and the oceans,
                        narcotics and hijacking.</p>

                    <p>To understand the nature of the new American role we must consider the great
                        historical changes that have taken place.</p>
                    <p>For 25 years after World War II, the United States was not only the leader of
                        the non-Communist world, it was the primary supporter and defender of this
                        free world as well.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>—But today our allies and friends have gained new strength and
                            self-confidence. They are now able to participate much more fully not
                            only in their own defense but in adding their moral and spiritual
                            strength to the creation of a stable world order.</item>
                        <item>—Today our adversaries no longer present a solidly united front; we
                            can now differentiate in our dealings with them.</item>
                        <item>—Today neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has a clear-cut
                            nuclear advantage; the time is therefore ripe to come to an agreement on
                            the control of arms.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The world has changed. Our foreign policy must change with it.</p>
                    <p>We have learned in recent years the dangers of over-involvement. The other
                        danger—a grave risk we are equally determined to avoid—is under-involvement.
                        After a long and unpopular war, there is temptation to turn inward—to
                        withdraw from the world, to back away from our commitments. That deceptively
                        smooth road of the new isolationism is surely the road to war.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy today steers a steady course between the past danger of
                        over-involvement and the new temptation of under-involvement.</p>
                    <p>That policy, which I first enunciated in Guam 19 months ago,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d85fn2">See 1969 volume, Item 279. [Footnote in the source text.
                            See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.]</note> represents our basic
                        approach to the world:</p>
                    <p>We will maintain our commitments, but we will make sure our own troop levels
                        or any financial support to other nations is appropriate to current threats
                        and needs.</p>
                    <p>We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a
                        nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our
                        security.</p>
                    <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0318"/>
                    <p>But we will look to threatened countries and their neighbors to assume
                        primary responsibility for their own defense, and we will provide support
                        where our interests our call for that support and where it can make a
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>These principles are not limited to security matters.</p>
                    <p>We shall pursue economic policies at home and abroad that encourage trade
                        wherever possible and that strengthen political ties between nations. As we
                        actively seek to help other nations expand their economies, we can
                        legitimately expect them to work with us in averting economic problems of
                        our own.</p>
                    <p>As we continue to send economic aid to developing nations, we will expect
                        countries on the receiving end to mobilize their resources; we will look to
                        other developed nations to do more in furnishing assistance; and we will
                        channel our aid increasingly through groups of nations banded together for
                        mutual support.</p>
                    <p>This new sharing of responsibility requires not less American leadership than
                        in the past, but rather a new, more subtle, form of leadership. No single
                        nation can build a peace alone; peace can only be built by the willing
                        hands—and minds—of all. In the modern world, leadership cannot be
                        “do-it-yourself”—the path of leadership is in providing the help, the
                        motive, the inspiration to do it together.</p>
                    <p>In carrying out what is referred to as the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine, we recognize that we cannot transfer burdens
                        too swiftly. We must strike a balance between doing too much and preventing
                        self-reliance, and suddenly doing too little and undermining
                        self-confidence. We intend to give our friends the time and the means to
                        adjust, materially and psychologically, to a new form of American
                        participation in the world.</p>
                    <p>How have we applied our new foreign policy during the past year? And what is
                        our future agenda as we work with others to build a stable world order?</p>
                    <p>In Western Europe, we have shifted from predominance to partnership with our
                        allies. Our ties with Western Europe are central to the structure of peace
                        because its nations are rich in tradition and experience, strong
                        economically, vigorous in diplomacy and culture; they are in a position to
                        take a major part in building a world of peace.</p>
                    <p>Our ties were strengthened on my second trip to Europe this summer and
                        reflected in our close consultation on arms control negotiations. At our

                        thorough review of its military strategy and posture. As a result, we have
                        reached new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden
                        more fairly.</p>

                    <p>The problems of Africa are great, but so is her potential. The United States
                        will support her peoples' efforts to build a continent that provides social
                        justice and economic expansion.</p>
                    <p>Turning to our own hemisphere: In Latin America, there was too much tendency
                        in the past to take our closest friends and neighbors for granted. Recently,
                        we have paid new respect to their proud traditions. Our trade, credit, and
                        economic policies have been reexamined and reformed to respond to their
                        concerns and their ideas, as well as to our own interests.</p>
                    <p>Our new Latin American policy is designed to help them help themselves; our
                        new attitude will not only aid their progress but add to their dignity.</p>
                    <p>Great changes are brewing throughout the American hemisphere. We can have no
                        greater goal than to help provide the means for necessary change to be
                        accomplished in peace and for all change to be in the direction of greater
                        self-reliance.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the Far East: a new Asia is emerging. The old enmities of World
                        War II are dead or dying. Asian states are stronger and are joining together
                        in vigorous regional groupings.</p>
                    <p>Here the doctrine that took shape last year is taking hold today, helping to
                        spur self-reliance and cooperation between states. In Japan, South Korea,
                        Thailand, and the Philippines, we have consolidated bases and reduced
                        American forces. We have relaxed trade and travel restrictions to underline
                        our readiness for greater contact with Communist China.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead in that area: <list>
                            <item>—While continuing to help our friends help themselves, we must
                                begin to consider how regional associations can work together with
                                the major powers in the area for a durable peace.</item>
                            <item>—We will work to build a strong partnership with Japan that will
                                accommodate our mutual interests.</item>
                            <item>—We will search for consecutive discussions with Communist China
                                while maintaining our defense commitment to Taiwan. When the <pb

                                Republic of China is ready to engage in talks, it will find us
                                receptive to agreements that further the legitimate national
                                interests of China and its neighbors.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>In Asia, we can see tomorrow's world in microcosm. An economically powerful
                        democratic free nation, Japan, is seeking new markets; a potentially
                        powerful Communist nation, China, will one day seek new outlets and new
                        relations; a Communist competitor, the Soviet Union, has interests there as
                        well; and the independent non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia are
                        already working together in regional association. These great forces are
                        bound to interact in the not too distant future. In the way they work
                        together and in the way we cooperate with their relationship is the key to
                        permanent peace in that area—the Far East, the scene of such a painful
                        legacy of the recent past, can become an example of peace and stability in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, the United States took the initiative to stop the
                        fighting and start the process of peace.</p>
                    <p>Along the Suez Canal a year ago, there was daily combat on the ground and in
                        the air. Diplomacy was at an impasse. The danger of local conflict was
                        magnified by growing Soviet involvement and the possibility of great powers
                        being drawn into confrontation.</p>
                    <p>America took the lead in arranging a cease-fire and getting negotiations
                        started. We are seeing to it that the balance of power, so necessary to
                        discourage a new outbreak of fighting, is not upset. Working behind the
                        scenes, when a crisis arose in Jordan, the United States played a key role
                        in seeing that order was restored and an invasion was abandoned.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that centuries of suspicion and decades of hostility cannot be
                        ended overnight. There are great obstacles in the way of a permanent,
                        peaceful settlement, and painful compromise is required by all
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>We are encouraged by the willingness of each of the parties to begin to look
                        to the larger interest of peace and stability throughout the Middle East.
                        There is still the risk of war, but now—for the first time in years—the
                        parties are actively calculating the risks of peace.</p>
                    <p>The policy of the United States will continue to be to promote peace
                        talks—not to try to impose a peace from the outside, but to support the
                        peace efforts of the parties in the region themselves.</p>
                    <p>One way to support these efforts is for the United States to discourage any
                        outside power from trying to exploit the situation for its own
                        advantage.</p>
                    <p>Another way for us to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement
                        is this: The United States is fully prepared to play a responsible and
                        cooperative role in keeping the peace arrived at through negotiation between
                        the parties.</p>
                    <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0321"/>
                    <p>We know what our vital interests are in the Middle East. Those interests
                        include friendly and constructive relations with all nations in the area.
                        Other nations know that we are ready to protect those vital interests. And
                        one good reason why other nations take us at our word in the Middle East is
                        because the United States has kept its word in Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>We now come to a matter that affects every nation: the relations between the
                        world's two great super powers.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 2 years, in some fields the Soviet Union and the United States
                        have moved ahead together. We have taken the first step toward cooperation
                        in outer space. We have both ratified the treaty limiting the spread of
                        nuclear weapons. Just 2 weeks ago, we signed a treaty to prohibit nuclear
                        weapons from the seabeds.</p>
                    <p>These are hopeful signs, but certain other Soviet actions are reason for
                        concern. There is need for much more cooperation in reducing tensions in the
                        Middle East and in ending harassment of Berlin. We must also discourage the
                        temptation to raise new challenges in sensitive areas such as the
                        Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>In the long run, the most significant result of negotiations between the
                        super powers in the past year could be in the field of arms control.</p>
                    <p>The strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union have produced the
                        most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever
                        conducted between our two nations. Each side has had the chance to explain
                        at length the concerns caused by the posture of the other side. The talks
                        have been conducted in a serious way without the old lapses into
                        propaganda.</p>
                    <p>If both sides continue in this way, there is reason to hope that specific
                        agreements will be reached to curb the arms race.</p>
                    <p>Taking a first step in limiting the capacity of mankind to destroy itself
                        would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world; it would add
                        to the security of both the Soviet Union and the United States, and it would
                        add to the world's peace of mind.</p>
                    <p>In all our relations with the Soviets, we shall make the most progress by
                        recognizing that in many cases our national interests are not the same. It
                        serves no purpose to pretend they are; our differences are not matters of
                        mood, they are matters of substance. But in many other cases, our separate
                        national interests can best be pursued by a sober consideration of the world
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>The United States will deal, as it must, from strength: We will not reduce
                        our defenses below the level I consider essential to our national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>A strong America is essential to the cause of peace today. Until we have the
                        kind of agreements we can rely on, we shall remain strong.</p>
                    <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0322"/>
                    <p>But America's power will always be used for building a peace, never for
                        breaking it—only for defending freedom, never for destroying it.</p>
                    <p>America's strength will be, as it must be, second to none; but the strength
                        that this Nation is proudest of is the strength of our determination to
                        create a peaceful world.</p>
                    <p>We all know how every town or city develops a sense of community when its
                        citizens come together to meet a common need.</p>
                    <p>The common needs of the world today, about which there can be no disagreement
                        or conflict of national interest, are plain to see.</p>
                    <p>We know that we must act as one world in restoring the world's environment,
                        before pollution of the seas and skies overwhelms every nation. We know we
                        must stop the flow of narcotics; we must counter the outbreaks of hijacking
                        and kidnapping; we must share the great discoveries about the oceans and
                        outer space.</p>
                    <p>The United States is justly proud of the lead it has taken in working within
                        the United Nations, and within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        alliance, to come to grips with these problems and with these
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Our work here is a beginning, not only in coping with the new challenges of
                        technology and modern life but of developing a worldwide “sense of
                        community” that will ease tension, reduce suspicion, and thereby promote the
                        process of peace.</p>
                    <p>That process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>We can have that mutual respect with our friends, without dominating them or
                        without letting them down.</p>
                    <p>We can have that mutual respect with our adversaries, without compromising
                        our principles or weakening our resolve.</p>
                    <p>And we can have that mutual respect among ourselves, without stifling dissent
                        or losing our capacity for action.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is something Americans have not enjoyed this century: a full
                        generation of peace. A full generation of peace depends not only on the
                        policy of one party or of one nation or one alliance or one bloc of
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Peace for the next generation depends on our ability to make certain that
                        each nation has a share in its shaping, and that every nation has a stake in
                        its lasting.</p>
                    <p>This is the hard way, requiring patience, restraint, understanding, and—when
                        necessary—bold, decisive action. But history has taught us that the old
                        diplomacy of imposing a peace by the fiat of great powers simply does not
                        work.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the new diplomacy of partnership, of mutual respect, of
                        dealing with strength and determination will work.</p>
                    <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0323"/>
                    <p>I believe that the right degree of American involvement—not too much and not
                        too little—will evoke the right response from our other partners on this
                        globe in building for our children the kind of world they deserve: a world
                        of opportunity in a world without war.</p>

                        policy, released February 25, 1971.]</p>
                    <p>M. Kalb: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, in going
                        through the report, and in discussing the basic philosophy of the foreign
                        policy, time and again the word isolationism comes up. Now, one could easily
                        get the impression that the President fears just over his shoulders this
                        terrible specter of a nation turning in on itself. One, is that really a
                        paramount fear in his mind and two, do you think it will happen?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This country has gone
                        through a very searing experience in the last 25 years and particularly in
                        the last decade. We went from isolationism in the pre-war period to total
                        involvement overseas, in a way in which problems in almost every part in the
                        world became a direct American responsibility which [and?] we designed the
                        programs around them with optimism, enthusiasm and dedication. Now in the
                        '60s and particularly the latter half of the '60s, we came up against a
                        number of situations that didn't prove very attractive and many profound
                        disappointments; the war in Viet Nam and many other things of that nature.
                        So that is a danger that we will swing in the opposite direction, that
                        having decided that too much involvement is wrong, we will go to little
                        involvement. But we are too powerful and too important to withdraw and what
                        the President attempts to do is to establish a balance to do the things that
                        only we can do but not to do the things for others that they can and should
                        do for themselves. There is some danger <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304"
                            facs="0324"/>that disappointed idealism may turn into withdrawal and
                        some of the most disillusioned people at the moment are precisely those
                        groups who deserve the greatest credit for having shaped the previous period
                        of foreign policy. We are concerned with the danger of withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>M. Kalb: Is it a fear of the right more than the left? Is this what he's
                        talking about here?</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't think you can
                        characterize the American discussion on foreign policy primarily in terms of
                        right and left. But for much of the post-war period we've had a bi-partisan
                        foreign policy. And even today it doesn't lend itself to such easy
                        characterization but what we are trying to do is to steer a course that
                        avoids extremes on either side of an unthinking, chauvinistic,
                        self-righteous, American fortuitous mentality and on the other hand of a
                        sort of undifferentiated involvement in international affairs in which we
                        just multiply our commitment, so there is a fear of both of these extremes
                        and an attempt to hold together the widest possible group that we can.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President's opening personal comments.]</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of peace is the opportunity which lies before you, and the
                        preservation of peace will be the special obligation of your generation.
                        There is no greater opportunity, and there is no greater responsibility.</p>
                    <p>It may be difficult now to appreciate this fully. Our involvement in the war
                        in Southeast Asia is drawing to an end. The next 3 years stretch before you,
                        with the prospect of danger or boredom or both. And I know some of you will
                        wonder about the significance of serving, about the need for it. I know that
                        many of you resent the time taken away from the pursuit of other careers.
                        You see these years as lost years.</p>
                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0325"/>
                    <p>I tell you, they will not be lost. Rather, I believe that nothing you do in
                        your life will be more important than the service you give in the next 3
                        years. Out of the sacrifice and the bitterness and the testing of the last
                        10 years has come the opportunity to achieve at last what Americans all want
                        and what we have not had in this whole century: a full generation of peace.
                        It is for us now to seize that opportunity, to win the peace. It will be for
                        you to keep it.</p>
                    <p>You serve in the peace forces of the world. There are those in America who
                        question this, but the record is clear. Our power has always been used for
                        building the peace, never for breaking it—for defending freedom, never for
                        destroying it.</p>
                    <p>America has fought in four wars in this century. Yet, we did not seek war; we
                        did not plan war; we did not begin war. But when it came, young Americans
                        fought courageously.</p>
                    <p>Today, despite the terrible evidence of this century, there are those who
                        have refused to learn the hard lessons of the history of tyranny. They would
                        tell us, as their predecessors in other times have told us, that the
                        appetite for aggression can be satisfied only if we are patient and that the
                        ambitions of the aggressor are justified if only we understand them
                        properly.</p>
                    <p>I am never surprised to see these positions held. But I am always astonished
                        to see them held in the name of morality. We know too well what follows when
                        nations try to buy peace at the expense of other nations. I do not believe
                        we are prepared to take that course. What is more important: No other nation
                        believes it either. That is why the United States of America is represented
                        and why it is respected among the nations of the free world—not because we
                        are rich and not because we are powerful, but, above all, because we can be
                        trusted. We have been, we continue to be, willing to pay the price for
                        peace. And we pay in the hard currency of deeds—not with hollow threats and
                        empty promises.</p>
                    <p>There can be no advantage to concealing hard facts in soft words. We know
                        that when force is rewarded, the cost of peace and the only alternative to
                        war will be tyranny. This fact dominated the first half of this century. We
                        are determined that it will not dominate the last half. For this reason we
                        have accepted the necessity of war. But our purpose is peace.</p>
                    <p>Peace with freedom—so that peace may be worth having.</p>
                    <p>Peace with justice—so that peace may be worth keeping.</p>
                    <p>And peace with strength—so that peace may be preserved.</p>
                    <p>We must have strength. If all the world were free, we might have no need of
                        arms. If all the world were just, we would have no need of valor. <pb
                            n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0326"/>But as we see that the values we
                        cherish are not cherished universally, and that there are those who feel
                        threatened by the prospects of freedom and justice, then we must keep the
                        strength we need to keep the values we cherish.</p>
                    <p>I know the arguments of the new isolationists. Though we cut defense
                        spending, we can't cut it enough. Though we greatly increase domestic
                        spending in proportion to defense spending, we can never increase it
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>I understand those arguments, and I understand the sentiments behind them.
                        But I understand the cost of weakness, too.</p>
                    <p>The question of what is enough is not academic. It is crucial to the survival
                        of this Nation.</p>
                    <p>If we have the most extensive urban renewal programs, the most far-reaching
                        medical care programs, the finest highways, the most comprehensive
                        educational assistance efforts, the most effective anti-poverty programs—if
                        we have all this and more, and if we have it all at the expense of our
                        ability to defend ourselves, then we would soon enjoy none of the fruits of
                        our efforts, and the only peace we would know would be that terrible peace
                        imposed upon those who are the victims of their own lack of vigilance.</p>
                    <p>And so today we will look to the possibilities of the future with a careful
                        regard for the realities of the present and the lessons of the past.</p>
                    <p>As you serve in our peace forces, you can be proud of this great fact: We
                        Americans firmly believe in what we are and in what we have. But we do not
                        choose to go the way of those ancient crusaders who sought to civilize the
                        world one grave at a time. We do not seek power as an end in itself. We seek
                        power adequate to our purpose, and our purpose is peace.</p>
                    <p>I have no illusions about the difficulty of achieving that purpose. I do not
                        believe that peace will suddenly descend upon us like the answer to a
                        prayer. I do not believe we should confuse the things we can expect from God
                        with the things God may expect from us. Rather, we have to build peace, you
                        and I together. We have to do it with our own hands because there is no
                        other way. And we have to do it with our own brains and our own courage and
                        our own faith.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe it will be done otherwise. But neither do I despair of its
                        being done, because I believe you will do the job, and not only you here in
                        uniform but your generation.</p>
                    <p>I remember very clearly an address President Eisenhower made in March of 1960
                        to a White House Conference on Children and Youth. He said, “our children
                        understand, as we did not in our own youthful days, the need—now approaching
                        the absolute—for peace with justice …. <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307"
                            facs="0327"/>among the things we teach to the young are such truths as
                        the transcendent value of the individual and the dignity of all people, the
                        futility and stupidity of war, its destructiveness of life and its
                        degradation of human values.”</p>
                    <p>In a decade of war since that time, the children he was talking about have
                        grown up. Some of you are here today. As the years have passed and I have
                        watched your generation, I have understood the wisdom of his words. The man
                        the French called the peace general had a vision of “the peace generation,”
                        and it has come to pass. You will be that generation.</p>
                    <p>As you take up your responsibilities today, as you begin the great work
                        before you, I want to remind you that you are not alone, that people of
                        other nations have served bravely and do so today in behalf of a lasting
                        peace. We are not the only nation that desires the end of war. We are the
                        most powerful nation, but gallant people around the globe share our faith
                        that the world is moving in the way of peace with freedom and with justice
                        for all. Some of them are here today. I want to salute those members of the
                        naval forces of the Republic of Vietnam who are here today.</p>
                    <p>I have known their country. I have known their struggle for almost 20 years.
                        I have visited Vietnam seven times. I have seen firsthand the courage of the
                        Vietnamese people, their endurance, their sacrifice, their will to be
                        free.</p>
                    <p>The rights we have learned to take for granted, they are still fighting
                        for.</p>
                    <p>War has been the condition of man from the dawn of history. Some have said
                        that wars are made by something ignorant in the human heart. If this is so,
                        then perhaps peace will come through something splendid in the human soul.
                        Perhaps man will learn not to answer what is primeval in his blood, but
                        rather to heed what is divine in his humanity.</p>
                    <p>However it may come, it is certain that peace and the greedy ambitions of
                        governments cannot survive in the same world. But I believe it is the
                        ambition of governments that is going to fail, because from having seen the
                        world, almost all the world, I know the people of the world want peace.</p>
                    <p>Through time they have watched the harvest of the plowshare rot in the fields
                        and on the vines while they have reaped the harvest of the sword. It would
                        be difficult to suppose that God created man for this end, and difficult to
                        doubt the wisdom of the Prophet, that “the work of righteousness shall be
                        peace ….”</p>
                    <p>So we have dreamed no small dream. We have set ourselves no easy task. We
                        seek to do the work of righteousness. In that work the <pb n="308"
                            xml:id="pg_308" facs="0328"/>years you give will not be lost. They will
                        be redeemed along with the hopes of humanity.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> met on April 20, 1971,
                        with members of the Republican Congressional leadership in the Cabinet Room
                        of the White House between 8:06 and 9:44 a.m. The group included Vice
                        President Agnew as well as more than a dozen members of the White House
                        staff. (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Presidential Materials, White House Central Files, Staff Members and Office
                        Files, Office of Presidential Papers and Archives, Daily Diary) According to
                        the notes prepared that day by the President's Special Assistant, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BP1">Patrick J. Buchanan</persName>, the discussion opened
                        mainly on economic matters.</p>
                    <p>“Following this the President went into a dissertation on American foreign
                        policy. It was one many of the members had probably heard before. The
                        President spoke against the new isolationism, saying that if we abandon the
                        world, pull back our aid, pull back our troops, it's not just economically
                        what is going to happen to the United States, but what kind of world is it
                        going to be. If we leave a vacuum in the world, then the other powers are
                        going to fill that vacuum. The President noted that these individuals you
                        see now up on Capitol Hill who are shouting the loudest about peace or
                        calling for cutbacks in aid and bringing home the troops, these individuals
                        are the ones who represent the greatest danger to peace; they are the ones
                        whose policies would generally invite a large war. With that kind of
                        reasoning, it will bring on war as sure as we're sitting here.”</p>
                    <p>After a brief discussion of extension of the draft, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> continued his comments on foreign
                        policy:</p>
                    <p>“Here and on several occasions during the meeting, the President indicated
                        that a lot of things are looking good for the doves right now, those who
                        vote against American armaments or who vote to bring the troops home, that
                        aren't going to be looking good in the near future. One came away with the
                        impression that the President was aware of something taking place or
                        something occurring which would make the policy of isolationism, the policy
                        of weakening America defensively, a disastrous one politically and a
                        dangerous one for the country.</p>
                    <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0329"/>
                    <p>“The President told the Congressmen that the Republicans there should not run
                        with these people, they are on the wrong course, and history will show they
                        were.</p>
                    <p>“The President then gave a brief talk about the ablest, most dynamic, most
                        energetic people in Europe were the Germans, in Asia they were the Japanese;
                        that these two peoples were with us now, not simply because of economics,
                        although there were strong economic ties, but because the United States was
                        the first power in the world and presented for them an umbrella for their
                        national security. When the United States ceases to be the first power in
                        the world, then these great powers are going to be looking elsewhere for
                        their deals, for their arrangements, and when that happens, the President
                        said, the United States is in serious trouble. That is why we've got to
                        remain number one.</p>
                    <p>“He used the steel figures of America and Japan to indicate the tremendous
                        growth of the Japanese empire. He said in 1950 the United States produced
                        about 47-48% of all the steel in the world; today we produce about 20% of
                        the steel. In 1950 Japan produced 5 million tons of steel; today she
                        produces over 100 million tons, and by 1974 she will exceed the United
                        States in production unless we do something with our productivity. One
                        hundred million Japanese, he said, produce twice as much as 800 million
                        Chinese. This is an indication of the capability of these people; we need
                        them on our side.</p>
                    <p>“Whittaker Chambers told me one time, he said, that the war in Korea was not
                        about Korea but was about Japan. In that sense, in that strategic sense, the
                        war in Vietnam is also about Japan.</p>
                    <p>“The President told an interesting anecdote. He said when he was down in
                        Williamsburg yesterday a little teenager came up to him and said, Mr.
                        President, how does it feel to be a war criminal. He said, well, what we are
                        doing in Vietnam today may make it possible that that young fellow won't
                        have to go off and fight and die in a war. If we remain strong, the
                        President said, we can establish a modus vivendi with the Soviet Union, a
                        modus vivendi with Red China. But we cannot if we weaken ourselves. In the
                        long run, the President said again, the others may look good for a while,
                        but down the road they are going to look very bad for the country, and bad
                        for themselves.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                    <p>Later in the day, in a meeting with Republican Senators and members of the
                        President's staff, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> expounded
                        further on the dangers of a U.S. retreat from world affairs. According to
                        notes prepared by Kenneth Belieu, the President's Deputy Assistant for
                        Senate Relations:</p>
                    <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>“The President said, ‘I know that you gentlemen are concerned about the
                        Vietnam War. The whole country is and many would like me to announce a
                        specific date of withdrawal. Actually it would be improper for me to tell
                        you, at this time, much more than I can tell anyone else. We must not
                        publicly indicate how, when and where we will do certain things, but you
                        will see from my announcements from time to time where we are going.’</p>
                    <p>“'The real issue, however, is where the United States will be after Vietnam.
                        Currently the popular thought is for us to cut back and to cease all actions
                        now. But, we are engaged in difficult negotiations around the world,
                        especially in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks. Some think
                        the simplest thing we could do would be to negotiate only on <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, but we must look at the whole picture.
                        Let's analyze just where we are now in national strength. We are ahead in
                        conventional power. We are roughly equal in air power. With regard to
                        nuclear punch they have approximately 1,500 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s—we have 1,000. They have bigger warheads or throw-weight.
                        By 1974 they will catch up to us in nuclear subs. We must negotiate on the
                        broad picture. We have to consider where we will be after Vietnam. We need
                        to end the war in Vietnam so the South Vietnamese will have a chance to
                        survive. We can't guarantee their perpetual survival, but we certainly owe
                        it to them and to the Free World to give them a chance for survival. Not
                        only for their sake, but for our sake because the other nations on the
                        perimeter of Asia: the Philippines, Korea, Japan itself, etc., cannot be
                        allowed to lose confidence in us, and they will if we leave
                        precipitously.'</p>
                    <p>“'If the world begins to think that the United States is content to be a
                        second rate power (and even if that seems to fit well within the United
                        States) it will not be conducive to peace in the world.'</p>
                    <p>“The President went on to explain, as he had in the Leadership meeting
                        earlier in the day, that there were two great and key nations or peoples on
                        the periphery of the Communist bloc that looked to us for a guarantee of
                        their own security. They are Japan and Germany—neither of them have nuclear
                        power. Germany, in Europe, will watch us. If she is convinced that America
                        is satisfied to become a second rate power—if she once loses confidence in
                        the American nuclear umbrella, she will accommodate herself with the East.
                        Then all the peoples inhabiting the rim lands around the Communist bloc
                        nations, who produce three times as much as the Communist countries, will
                        have second thoughts. The same situation could happen with respect to Japan.
                        Japan has 110 million people, and produces 2-1/2 times as much as China. It
                        sits on the western borders of the Pacific in geographical position relative
                        to Germany on the western borders of Russia and if Japan thinks the U.S.
                        protection is not enough, then despite all else, despite its ties with us,
                            <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0331"/>economic links, its preference
                        to deal with the West, it will look elsewhere. Then, where would we stand?
                        And, what change in U.S. stature would occur over the long run? What this
                        would do to our Nation's soul is frightening to contemplate.</p>
                    <p>“The President pointed out that any President, especially the one occupying
                        the White House at this time, with the delicate balance existing in the
                        world, needed strength and evidence of such strength—not only military but
                        cohesive political backing to enable him to play the proper cards to have
                        the ‘blue chips’ essential in the international poker game.</p>
                    <p>“'We could well be the last Administration that cares about America's future
                        in the international field. That is why <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>

                        deployment.'”</p>

                        of its highly classified nature), <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> returned to his theme: “the President said there is a
                        brighter side we can look at. We should not always look at the negative
                        side. Both China and Russia want to increase their consumer goods. Russia
                        especially. The consumer pressure is building up. The world wants peace and
                        we must take this opportunity to get it. He said, ‘One thing I want to point
                        out. If <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> is to have a chance—the
                        negotiations in <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>—we cannot give away in
                        the Senate things we might want to discuss in <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss>. Now is a critical time. If the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> sees the United States ignoring its responsibilities in
                        the draft for instance, in maintaining an adequate Armed Force, or on the
                        Foreign Aid program, she could obviously take this as a sign of weakness and
                        say; Why should we continue to negotiate <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> when the United States is going to take these actions
                        itself unilaterally?’</p>
                    <p>“‘The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has strong reasons to have an
                        agreement, but we know for a fact that they will only deal from strength and
                        that they respect those who have strength, otherwise they have historically
                        moved into the power vacuums.’ The President said, ‘I know it is difficult
                        for you gentlemen to always stand firm on these hard issues; but this is the
                        better part of valor and the greater part of statesmanship. Even though it
                        is hard, it is terribly important to the United States and that in itself is
                        good politics.’</p>
                    <p>“He pointed out that those who are for unilateral disarmament are the ones
                        who will really put the world into jeopardy as far as the future is
                        concerned. Past history shows that aggression moves into areas of
                        weakness.”</p>

                    <p>On September 15, 1970 I proposed a major transformation in the foreign
                        assistance program of the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d70">Document 70</ref>.</note> My purpose was to renew and
                        revitalize the commitment of this Nation to support the security and
                        development objectives of the lower income countries, and thereby to promote
                        some of the most fundamental objectives of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Today, I report to you on the progress of the last seven months in effecting
                        that transformation and ask the Congress to join me in taking the next
                        creative step in our new approach—the reform of the United States bilateral
                        assistance program.</p>
                    <p>To achieve such reform, I am transmitting two bills—the proposed
                        International Security Assistance Act and International Development and
                        Humanitarian Assistance Act—and announcing a number of actions which I
                        intend to take administratively. Taken together, they would: <list>
                            <item>—Distinguish clearly between our security, development and
                                humanitarian assistance programs and create separate organizational
                                structures for each. This would enable us to define our own
                                objectives more clearly, fix responsibility for each program, and
                                assess the progress of each in meeting its particular
                                objectives.</item>
                            <item>—Combine our various security assistance efforts (except for those
                                in Southeast Asia which are now funded in the Defense budget) into
                                one coherent program, under the policy direction of the Department
                                of <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0333"/>State. This would enable
                                security assistance to play more effectively its critical role in
                                supporting the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine
                                and overall U.S. national security and foreign policy in the
                                1970s.</item>
                            <item>—Create a U.S. International Development Corporation and a U.S.
                                International Development Institute to replace the Agency for
                                International Development. They would enable us to reform our

                    <p>U.S. foreign assistance is central to U.S. foreign policy in the 1970s in
                        three ways: <list>
                            <item>First, we must help to strengthen the defense capabilities and
                                economies of our friends and allies. This is necessary so that they
                                can increasingly shoulder their own responsibilities, so that we can
                                reduce our direct involvement abroad, and so that together we can
                                create a workable structure for world peace. This is an essential
                                feature of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                                Doctrine.</item>
                            <item>Second, we must assist the lower income countries in their efforts
                                to achieve economic and social development. Such development is the
                                overriding objective of these countries themselves and essential to
                                the peaceful world order which we seek. The prospects for a peaceful
                                world will be greatly enhanced if the two-thirds of humanity who
                                live in these countries see hope for adequate food, shelter,
                                education and employment in peaceful progress rather than in
                                revolution.</item>
                            <item>Third, we must be able to provide prompt and effective assistance
                                to countries struck by natural disaster or the human consequences of
                                political upheaval. Our humanitarian concerns for mankind require
                                that we be prepared to help in times of acute human distress.</item>

                    <p rend="center">The Need for Reform</p>
                    <p>We cannot effectively pursue these objectives in the 1970s with programs
                        devised for an earlier period. The world has changed dramatically. Our
                        foreign assistance programs—like our overall foreign policy—must change to
                        meet these new conditions.</p>
                    <p>In my September special message to the Congress I spelled out the major
                        changes in the world which require new responses. Let me summarize them
                        here: <list>
                            <item>—Today the lower income countries are increasingly able to
                                shoulder the major responsibility for their own security and
                                development <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0334"/>and they
                                clearly wish to do so. We share their belief that they must take the
                                lead in charting their own security and development. Our new foreign
                                assistance programs must therefore encourage the lower income
                                countries to set their own priorities and develop their own
                                programs, and enable us to respond as our talents and resources
                                permit.</item>
                            <item>—Today the United States is but one of many industrialized nations
                                which contribute to the security and development of the lower income
                                countries. We used to furnish the bulk of international development
                                assistance; we now provide less than half. The aid programs of other
                                countries have grown because they recognize that they too have a
                                major stake in the orderly progress which foreign assistance
                                promotes, and because their capabilities to provide such assistance
                                have grown enormously since the earlier postwar period.</item>
                            <item>—Today the international institutions can effectively mesh the
                                initiatives and efforts of the lower income countries and the aid
                                efforts of all of the industrialized countries. We can thus place
                                greater reliance on such institutions and encourage them to play an
                                increasing leadership role in the world development process.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our ideas on the reforms needed in the world of the 1970s have evolved
                        significantly since I received the Report of my Task Force on International
                        Development, chaired by Mr. <persName>Rudolph</persName> Peterson, and since
                        my special message of last September, as the result of our own deliberations
                        and our further consultations with the Congress, the business community and
                        many other sectors of the American public, and our friends abroad. Before
                        spelling out a new blueprint for our bilateral assistance program, however,
                        I wish to report to you on the gratifying progress achieved since last
                        September in reorienting our assistance policies.</p>

                                    >Nixon</persName> Doctrine. This legislation authorized
                                additional funds for military assistance and supporting economic
                                assistance for countries in which the U.S. has major interests and
                                which have convincingly demonstrated the will and ability to help
                                themselves—including Israel and Jordan in the Middle East and
                                Cambodia, Vietnam and Korea in East Asia.</p>
                            <p>Such support is necessary to carry out one of the central thrusts of

                                from bearing the major responsibility for the defense of our friends
                                and allies to helping them achieve an increasing capability to
                                maintain their own defense. This increase in security assistance
                                enables us to continue to reduce our direct presence <pb n="315"

                    <p>On April 21, 1971, the same day the President sent to Congress his message on
                        foreign assistance reform (see <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>), Peter
                        G. Peterson, Executive Director of the Council on International Economic
                        Policy, conducted a press briefing on the subject of the President's
                        message. He was accompanied by C. Fred Bergsten, Assistant for International
                        Economic Affairs, National Security Council; James R. Schlesinger, Assistant
                        Director, Office of Management and Budget; and Ernest Stern, senior staff
                        member, Council on International Economic Policy. The press conference began
                        with a briefing by Peterson, in which he provided the context for the
                        President's proposals:</p>
                    <p>“The changes in our foreign policy are very familiar to you already. The new
                        foreign policy concepts that are implied in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine call for a new partnership, the primary
                        purpose of which is to achieve a generation of peace in a durable world
                        order. More specifically, it means a greater sharing with others in the
                        definition of policy and in the bearing of costs.</p>
                    <p>“It means the encouragement of others to participate fully in the creation of
                        plans and designing programs. And while it means continuing U.S. leadership,
                        it means a leadership within an active partnership rather than a leadership
                        of unilateral decision.</p>
                    <p>“The reorganization reflects these basic policy objectives. It brings under
                        one authority the economic and military assistance programs which are
                        necessary to shoulder the responsibility for defense without endangering the
                        freedom and independence of our allies and friends.</p>
                    <p>“The resources that are being requested are approximately at the same
                        [level]as the funding of these programs last year. They are small, we
                        believe, compared to the savings and reductions of American troops
                        overseas.</p>
                    <p>“On the other hand, the International Development Assistance Act will provide
                        us with a vital instrument to support our long-term foreign policy interests
                        in developing countries.</p>
                    <p>“As I will show you in a moment with some charts, about two-thirds of the
                        world lives in these countries. And I thought you might be interested in my
                        telling you about some data that might help orient you a little better to
                        the Message as a whole.</p>
                    <p>“When we talk about the less-developed countries, let's remember we are
                        talking about roughly two-thirds of the free world and while there has been
                        growth over the last ten years at a slightly higher rate than developed
                        countries in their Gross National Product, one of the particular problems is
                        that the per capita growth in population during <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318"
                            facs="0338"/>this period has been at significantly higher levels in
                        less-developed countries than in the industrialized countries, with the
                        result that, if you will look at the per capita income, you will see that
                        the growth continues to be significantly higher for the developed countries
                        than for the less-developed countries.</p>
                    <p>“If I may show you this chart, in general, there was a watershed date here in
                        this period, but for the first time, the rest of the world contributed more
                        official aid to less-developed countries than the United States, until at
                        the present time, we account for about 45 percent of the total aid, official
                        aid, that is.</p>
                    <p>“You will also notice, however, that the rest of the free world is putting in
                        a great deal of private investment into these less-developed countries.</p>
                    <p>“As one looks at numbers of these kinds, he often sees them expressed in
                        terms of per capita income in these particular countries. If you take them
                        as a whole, you will find that the per capita income is approximately $200
                        for these countries that constitute two-thirds of the world.</p>
                    <p>“Numbers have a way sometimes of not conveying the human meaning of $200
                        versus $3,000 to $4,000 in the industrialized countries of the world.</p>
                    <p>“Let's think of it perhaps in human terms, whether these people want—I am
                        sure they want a job. The numbers there are sobering. About 20 percent to 50
                        percent of the people in these less-developed countries are unemployed. They
                        undoubtedly want good health. About one out of four children in this
                        two-thirds section of the free world die before the age of one. About half
                        of the children die before the age of four. Obviously these people want
                        food. I have been impressed with the number that three-fourths of the
                        children in this two-thirds of the world suffer from serious malnutrition to
                        the point where, as you all well know, their human development is retarded
                        in one way or another.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, there is a world where education is important. In this two-thirds
                        of the world, only about five percent of the children ever reach high
                        school. So that is a part of the world in which many of America's and the
                        world's most important political issues will certainly be tried and many of
                        these political issues have a very basic economic origin to them.</p>
                    <p>“Another question that is raised, aside from the political and humanitarian
                        aspects of this, is how is this related to the economic interests of
                        America?</p>
                    <p>“I might point out that there is a high correlation between the rate at which
                        these countries grow in their exports and the rate in turn in which their
                        Gross National Product grows.</p>
                    <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0339"/>
                    <p>“If we want them to get stronger and more industrialized, we must also think
                        about their exports. One might say, ‘Well, these exports are certainly in
                        their interests. Are they in the interest of the United States?’</p>
                    <p>“Well, aside from assuring a more stable and peaceful structure, I would want
                        to remind you that in many of these rapidly growing markets our exports to
                        these countries from America have doubled in the last four years.</p>
                    <p>“So, aside from the political and humanitarian issues, I think there are some
                        very important issues in terms of our own economic development.”</p>
                    <p>Peterson then discussed the essentials of the new proposals:</p>
                    <p>“Under this new structure, you will see an International Security Assistance
                        Act where, for the first time, all of the security assistance is looked at
                        together and hopefully in a more integrated way and includes all of these
                        categories of international security assistance.</p>
                    <p>“Then all of the development and humanitarian assistance is grouped together
                        in this set of categories here. I hope most of you can read those. I am sure
                        you read at least as well as I do.</p>
                    <p>“The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which is set up to guarantee
                        U.S. overseas private investment has already been passed. But I did want you
                        to recall that. Here is the Inter-American Foundation, which was authorized
                        by Congress last year and is now operating and it finances the social
                        development programs in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>“The Peterson Task Force and the subsequent Presidential decision on this new
                        development assistance part of the program—and we have experts here who will
                        be happy to answer your questions on any specific aspects you want—but on
                        the development side, there are distinct objectives now for each of these
                        agencies. Each of them has a mission. The President has been quite emphatic
                        in being sure that this program be very responsive to initiatives by the
                        less developed countries; that they have come up with, to the maximum extent
                        possible to function in a frame work set by international institutions.</p>
                    <p>“We want to have as cooperative an effort in this important field as we can,
                        concentrating on countries of special interest to the United States and on
                        projects where the United States has special competence—that is, really
                        having something to contribute; match the terms of our assistance to the
                        economic capacity of the recipient, which is, I think, an important way of
                        increasing the productivity; extremely important, improving the management
                        to carry out these basic reforms; and an important byproduct of this program
                        will be to reduce substantially the number of U.S. Government officials
                        overseas that have previously been involved in these programs.</p>
                    <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0340"/>
                    <p>“The first structure is in the development side, the U.S. International
                        Development Corporation. Its basic activities are development loans to
                        developing countries, very often on a project or program basis and important
                        technical services that are related to either preparing the loan request or
                        implementing the program. Here are the operating principles that are implied
                        here. They will be run in response to specific proposals where the United
                        States has a long-term interest. They will function in the framework set by
                        the international institutions and very often in coordination and
                        cooperation with other bilateral donors.</p>
                    <p>“The loan terms will be tailor-made to the repayment capacity of the
                        recipient: the valuation of the loans on sound business and development
                        criteria; and operations will be centralized in Washington, thereby reducing
                        field staff and relying more on the recipients for relevant information.</p>
                    <p>“In the management sense, there will be a Board of Directors. You will notice
                        here that this will include not only the Secretaries of State and Treasury,
                        but three private individuals. This group will have its own charter. The
                        President will be the operating head and the request is for a three-year,
                        $2.5 billion authorization, both appropriated funds and borrowing
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>“The U.S. International Development Institute, we think, also fills an
                        important need. One is to finance research that is relevant to development,
                        strengthen research capacity which is very much lacking, as all of you know,
                        in less-developed countries; provide training. Know-how is a very important
                        part of this process; and to help build institutions with emphasis on
                        agriculture and education that can continue this development process within
                        the country; and finance advisers on development problems.</p>
                    <p>“The operating principles, again, will be to be very responsive to proposals
                        that come from them; to concentrate on development problems in which we
                        believe the United States has special competence; to try to build and
                        emphasize research capacity within the less-developed countries; to provide
                        grant financing but insisting on <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                        contributions; more from the more advanced countries and less from the
                        poorest; and implement projects through the private sector reducing official
                        U.S. overseas personnel.</p>
                    <p>“Management and finance, the two will have a Board of Trustees. You will
                        notice that the majority will be private citizens. Again, the Executive
                        Director will be the operating head and again we are asking for a three-year
                        authorization of $1.3 billion. I would emphasize here the concept of
                        continuity and forward planning.</p>
                    <p>“The very nature of the development process is a long-term process and all of
                        the people who know this field best believe that the long-range <pb n="321"
                            xml:id="pg_321" facs="0341"/>planning requirements should be reflected
                        in the way the funds are authorized for it to operate.</p>
                    <p>“I should want you to know that there has been careful consultation with the
                        legislature in this program and that one of the questions that has come up
                        from the beginning of the Task Force and certainly recently is the whole
                        question of coordination of this development assistance operation.</p>
                    <p>“Under this bill, there will be a U.S. coordinator of bilateral development
                        assistance. He or she will be appointed by the President with the advice and
                        consent of the Senate, responsible to the President, accountable to the
                        Congress as the Administration spokesman on bilateral development
                        assistance. He will exercise his authority by being Chairman of each of
                        these boards that I have mentioned. He will chair an Executive Committee,
                        the operating heads of the three agencies. He will operate under the foreign
                        policy guidance of the Secretary of State, coordinate with the National
                        Security Council, and of course security issues are involved and under the
                        coordination of the new Council on International Economic Policy and
                        Economic Development Issues.</p>
                    <p>“In terms of the funds that are involved here, we have them broken down as
                        between nearly $2 billion, $1.993 billion for the international security
                        assistance portion and $1.245 billion for the development assistance
                        portion.</p>
                    <p>“I might say that in hearing the President discuss this program, he has said
                        that this is not the kind of world where we dare leave a vacuum and it is
                        not the kind of world where we can withdraw our physical presence as we are
                        in key areas of the world and, at the same time, withdraw our economic
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>“If we are going to have a generation of peace, it is not going to be simply
                        by ending a war, but by building a structure for peace. And he believes that
                        one of the key foundations of that structure for peace has to do with the
                        vital and viable group of less-developed countries, which, as I have
                        indicated, account for two-thirds of the world's population where many of
                        the political issues of the '70's will arise and where in turn many of the
                        political issues are at their core economic issues.” (The Richard Nixon
                        Library, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Papers)</p>
                    <p>A period of questions and answers followed Peterson's briefing, which began
                        at 10:25 and ended at 11:05 a.m.</p>

                    <p>“The most significant areas of the world in the immediate future are like
                        five fingers of the hand. Other areas like Africa and Latin America are 50
                        years away. But here are the five fingers: (The President held up his hand
                        and ticked them off.) First the thumb, the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                        >US</gloss>, still the strongest; next Western Europe and, boy, that Common
                        Market is coming along fast; third, the Soviet Union; fourth, China; fifth,
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>“With that kind of world, the United States of America is now entering a very
                        interesting period.</p>
                    <p>“Our vision is obscured by our obsession with the war in Vietnam. God knows,
                        that war will be over quite soon. If we had such control over our other
                        problems, it would all be easy.</p>
                    <p>“We will have a live-and-let-live situation with the Soviet Union; we will
                        have a strong ally in Western Europe, but not doing much for its own
                        defense; we will have a competing China, no longer isolated; and we will
                        have a growing Japan.</p>
                    <p>“Now, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> looks at low labor rates around
                        the world and its immediate reaction is, ‘Boy, we better put up some
                        quotas.’ Congressional pressure along these lines is enormous. But the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> cannot build a fence around itself and
                        expect to survive as a great nation. If we did, the rest of the world, still
                        having to make it, would out-produce us. Soon, the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> would not be #1, and there are areas in which I am for the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> being #1.</p>
                    <p>“Here's the irony: the success of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> diplomacy
                        will lead to greater dangers and opportunities economically.</p>
                    <p>“This morning, in the Cabinet meeting, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> saw a period of five to ten years from now when 75%
                        of our foreign policy would be economics. We either have to come to the
                        mark, or we will be #2 economically. If that should happen, something will
                        go out of the American spirit. That's why I don't like to give up on the
                            <gloss target="#t_SST1">SST</gloss>, and that's why we are ending the
                        war the way we are. Difficult as it is, that's the easiest thing we have to
                        do.</p>
                    <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0343"/>
                    <p>“It's terribly important we be #1 economically because otherwise we can't be
                        #1 diplomatically or militarily. You hear a lot of stuff around that the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is not to be trusted with power. You
                        hear that our Presidents lie us into wars—though I think, when all the facts
                        come out, we will have a better view. You hear that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is imperialistic and aggressive. But we build
                        up our enemies after wars, and we ask for not one acre. What will we get for
                        ourselves out of Vietnam? Nothing.</p>
                    <p>“As distinguished from other great powers throughout civilization, we did not
                        ask for our position of power, nor did we even have a policy for acquiring
                        the power. It fell into our lap.</p>
                    <p>“For the next quarter century, let us see to it that we do play this role. We
                        care when there is an earthquake in Peru or a famine in India. Never has a
                        nation given more and gotten less.</p>
                    <p>“I have been more melodramatic than I meant to be, but if the moment comes
                        when we are not competitive, our standard of living will go down, inflation
                        will go up, and something will go out of the American spirit.</p>
                    <p>“This would diminish the chances for a generation of peace. The future of the
                        economy is in our hands—and also the future of peace.”</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Good evening:</p>
                    <p>I have requested this television time tonight to announce a major development
                        in our efforts to build a lasting peace in the world.</p>
                    <p>As I have pointed out on a number of occasions over the past 3 years, there
                        can be no stable and enduring peace without the participation of the
                        People's Republic of China and its 750 million people. That is why I have
                        undertaken initiatives in several areas to open the door for more normal
                        relations between our two countries.</p>

                    <p>In pursuance of that goal, I sent Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, my Assistant for National Security Affairs, to
                        Peking during his recent world tour for the purpose of having talks with

                    <p>The announcement I shall now read is being issued simultaneously in Peking,

                        Affairs, held talks in Peking from July 9 to 11, 1971. Knowing of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s expressed desire to visit
                        the People's Republic of China, Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName>, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic
                        of China, has extended an invitation to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to visit China at an appropriate date
                        before May 1972. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has
                        accepted the invitation with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>The meeting between the leaders of China and the United States is to seek the
                        normalization of relations between the two countries and also to exchange
                        views on questions of concern to the two sides.</p>
                    <p>In anticipation of the inevitable speculation which will follow this
                        announcement, I want to put our policy in the clearest possible context.</p>
                    <p>Our action in seeking a new relationship with the People's Republic of China
                        will not be at the expense of our old friends. It is not directed against
                        any other nation. We seek friendly relations with all nations. Any nation
                        can be our friend without being any other nation's enemy.</p>
                    <p>I have taken this action because of my profound conviction that all nations
                        will gain from a reduction of tensions and a better relationship between the
                        United States and the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>It is in this spirit that I will undertake what I deeply hope will become a
                        journey for peace, peace not just for our generation but for future
                        generations on this earth we share together.</p>

                    <head>93. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On July 16, 1971, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                        provided a briefing on a background basis to members of the press on his
                        visit to Peking and the upcoming Presidential visit to China publicly
                        announced the previous evening. In response to a question about recent
                        public statements by the <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0345"
                        />administration cautioning against exaggerated expectations of improved
                        relations with China, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        explained:</p>
                    <p>“Well, we have had a difficult problem with maintaining a public posture on
                        this issue. The relationships with the People's Republic have gone in
                        essentially two phases: (1) In the first year and a half of the
                        Administration, there was a general attempt on our part to communicate to
                        Peking that we were prepared to have a serious dialogue, and that we were
                        not prisoners of history.</p>
                    <p>“We also took, in addition, a series of unilateral steps that were public
                        that symbolized this. Then, starting this spring, about concurrently with
                        the visible manifestation of the ping-pong diplomacy, the manifestations
                        having been in a general framework of trying to express a general attitude,
                        both sides moved into a more concrete phase.</p>
                    <p>“On the other hand, there are a number of really interesting aspects. When
                        you have not been in touch with a country for 25 years, it is amazing how
                        technically difficult it is to simply find out where you should talk, and
                        with whom. That is something that we don't teach in textbooks on
                        diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>“When you are nursing a rather tenuous dialogue, you don't want to create
                        excessive expectations of how it might go. Even after we knew, for example,
                        that a visit by the American envoy in Peking would be welcome, there still
                        remained a lot to be discussed about how to work it out; what should be
                        discussed; what the objectives should be.</p>
                    <p>“The President felt that until we know that, it would be best not to raise
                        undue expectations, excessive speculation, for each side to take a public
                        position that it might then regret, and if it turned out that a later moment
                        would be more propitious, we could then do it without embarrassment or
                        without a sense of failure.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also addressed the impact
                        of the opening to China on U.S.-Soviet relations, particularly a prospective
                        summit:</p>
                    <p>“The President's view on a meeting with the Soviet leaders has been
                        frequently stated. It is one that, of course, he has always been, in
                        principle, willing to undertake. It would seem to me that the occasion of a
                        visit to Peking is not the best to also visit Moscow. The issues to be
                        discussed between the two countries are too various. But in principle, we
                        are prepared to meet with the Soviet leaders whenever our negotiations have
                        reached a point where something fruitful can be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>“Let me make one other point: Nothing that has been done in our relations
                        with the People's Republic of China has any purpose or is in any way
                        directed against any other countries, and especially not against the Soviet
                        Union. We are taking these steps because we cannot imagine a stable,
                        international peace in which a country of 750 million people is <pb n="326"
                            xml:id="pg_326" facs="0346"/>kept in isolation. We believe that by
                        improving relations with the People's Republic of China we are contributing
                        to peace in the world, and therefore are contributing to all nations.”</p>
                    <p>Returning to his earlier theme, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> expanded on the two phases in the development of
                        informal relations with the People's Republic of China:</p>
                    <p>“I was saying that there were two phases in our relationship with the
                        People's Republic of China: One, a period in which a general framework was
                        established, first through a series of communications in various ways on our
                        part that indicated that we were not bound by previous history and that
                        expressed general philosophy. That also was expressed in the President's
                        annual foreign policy report and was expressed in the first public use of
                        the phrase, ‘People's Republic of China’ last October in a toast of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to President
                        Ceausescu, and was repeated in February in the President's World Report,
                        even in the middle of the Laotian operation. There was also a series of
                        steps which the Department of State took to indicate a general willingness
                        to open relations as well as public statements by the Secretary of State and
                        others.</p>
                    <p>“The second phase started in April when we moved from this general framework
                        to a more specific exploration of where we might go from here. Then in
                        April, May, and June this meeting was set up through a series of exchanges
                        and very detailed preparations which were made. The preparations had been
                        somewhat handicapped by the fact that the only senior officials who knew
                        about it were the President, the Secretary of State and myself.”</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of the briefing, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> discussed the opening to China within the context
                        of world affairs:</p>
                    <p>“We knew that making this decision would hurt some old friends. It is always
                        difficult to break away from a well established pattern, which at least has
                        the advantage that its framework has become very familiar. It forced us to
                        re-think the whole nature of the world in which policy had been conducted
                        more or less as if the People's Republic of China did not exist.</p>
                    <p>“I don't want to speak for the People's Republic of China, but I don't doubt
                        that for their leaders there were some enormously complex decisions to be
                        made, given their image of the United States and given the fact of this
                        long-time hostility and, indeed, confrontation in so many parts of the
                        world, sometimes physically and always ideologically.</p>
                    <p>“So it was a complex, and I am frank to say, in many respects a moving
                        occasion to have the privilege of seeing the beginning of this and dealing
                        with what are no doubt very dedicated and very serious <pb n="327"
                            xml:id="pg_327" facs="0347"/>people, and we both recognized that we were
                        engaged on a very difficult path which had many pitfalls and which would
                        take an enormous sense of restraint and responsibility on both sides.”

                            Dobrynin</persName> to “get a feeling for <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                        Summit.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> found <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> concerned that the U.S.-China
                        initiative, in particular a <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        visit to China, resulted from the Soviets having been evasive in a recent
                        U.S. inquiry about the long-discussed U.S.-Soviet Summit. “<persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was at his oily best,” wrote
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> in a memorandum of
                        conversation, “and, for the first time in my experience, totally insecure.”
                        With respect to the question of a U.S.-Soviet summit and its timing in
                        relation to the U.S.-China meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> spoke bluntly:</p>
                    <p>“I said that I wanted to be frank with him. Perhaps in the first year of our
                        Administration we had not always been forthcoming in improving relations
                        with the Soviet Union, but ever since April 1970 we believe we have made an
                        unending series of overtures. The Soviet response has been grudging and
                        petty, especially on the Summit Meeting. They simply did not understand the
                        President. The President thought in broad philosophical terms and had
                        sincerely believed that his meeting with the Soviet leaders might open new
                        vistas for cooperation around the world; instead, he found himself
                        confronted with one evasion after another. As <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> very well knew, I had urged him to have an answer
                        by July 1st and even then it had taken till July 5th, and he had then been
                        evasive again, saying that the meeting could take place in November and
                        December. This was in effect a rejection, because I had already told him
                        that November and December were highly inconvenient. Indeed, I did not know
                        whether <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was even saying we
                        should fix a date.</p>
                    <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0348"/>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in reply was almost beside
                        himself with protestations of goodwill. On the contrary, he said, he could
                        tell me strictly off the record that a meeting between his leaders and the
                        President was very much on their minds. What in fact had happened was that
                        September did not seem possible, and now November was the earliest possible
                        date. He was certain the Soviet leaders would be willing to set another date
                        for a Summit, but now they did not know whether our meeting with Peking made
                        it impossible. Would we be willing to come to Moscow before going to
                        Peking?</p>
                    <p>“I replied that it did not seem to me proper to go to Moscow before having
                        gone to Peking, that we should go in the order in which the announcements
                        were made. He asked whether we would be prepared to announce a meeting
                        before having been in Peking. I said that that was a distinct possibility
                        but that I would have to check this with the President and let him know
                        later in the day.</p>
                    <p>“[I called <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at 7:00 that
                        evening after checking with the President and told him that we would be
                        prepared to announce a meeting in Moscow after having set the date of a
                        meeting in Peking but before we had actually visited Peking.]” (Brackets in
                        the source text)</p>
                    <p>During this meeting, which took place in the Map Room of the White House,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> about his meeting in Peking:</p>
                    <p>“He asked me whether the Soviet Union had come up. I replied that
                        realistically it was obvious that we could do nothing to help Communist
                        China against the Soviet Union. In any event to us the Soviet Union was a
                        world power, while we recognized that China was primarily significant for
                        Asian settlements. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                        whether <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had indicated
                        any worry about a Soviet attack. I said there were practically no references
                        to the Soviet Union except an occasional vague allusion, while it seemed to
                        me that the primary fear of Communist China was Japan.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> brightened considerably and
                        said that this was exactly his conviction of Chinese priorities. He asked
                        what there really was to talk about between us and the Chinese? Were we
                        interested in Chinese domination of Southeast Asia? He had always thought
                        that the Soviet interests and ours were much more nearly complementary with
                        respect to the defense of Southeast Asia. I said that I wasn't certain that
                        the Chinese had aggressive tendencies in Southeast Asia but that in any
                        event we would not favor Chinese expansion beyond their borders.” (National
                        Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                        Materials, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, <persName

                    <p>From <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s perspective, Soviet
                        concerns over the U.S. opening to China yielded immediate dividends. He
                        recalled in his memoirs: “Other negotiations deadlocked for months began
                        magically to <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0349"/>unfreeze.” Such issues
                        as the Berlin discussions and talks to guard against accidental nuclear war
                        “moved rapidly to completion within weeks of the Peking announcement.”
                            (<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, White House Years,
                        pages 766-767) But <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        maintained that the concept of triangular diplomacy was complicated. He
                        recalled:</p>
                    <p>“It could not be a crude attempt to play off China against the Soviet Union.
                        ‘The China card’ was not ours to play. Sino-Soviet hostility had followed
                        its own dynamic. We had not generated it; we were, in fact, unaware of its
                        intensity for the better part of a decade. Neither Peking nor Moscow was
                        quarreling with the other to curry favor with us; they were currying favor
                        with us because they were quarreling. We could not ‘exploit’ that rivalry;
                        it exploited itself.” (Ibid., page 763)</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of timing of the President's trip to China.]</p>
                    <p>Now, as to the effect the visit will have, and the conversations will have,
                        on Vietnam, I will not speculate on that subject. I will only say that as
                        the joint announcement indicated, this will be a wide-ranging discussion of
                        issues concerning both governments. It is not a discussion that is going to
                        lead to instant détente.</p>
                    <p>What it really is, is moving—as we have moved, I believe, in the situation
                        with regard to the Soviet Union—from an era of confrontation without
                        communication to an era of negotiation with discussion. It does not mean
                        that we go into these meetings on either side with any illusions about the
                        wide differences that we have. Our interests are very different, and both
                        sides recognized this, in the talks that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> had, the very extended talks he had with Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. We do not expect
                        that these talks will settle all of those differences.</p>
                    <p>What is important is that we will have opened communication to see where our
                        differences are irreconcilable, to see that they can be settled <pb n="330"
                            xml:id="pg_330" facs="0350"/>peacefully, and to find those areas where
                        the United States, which today is the most powerful nation in the world, can
                        find areas of agreement with the most populous nation in the world which
                        potentially in the future could become the most powerful nation in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>As we look at peace in the world for the balance of this century, and for
                        that matter even in the next century, we must recognize that there cannot be
                        world peace on which all the peoples in the world can rely, on which they
                        have such a great stake, unless there is communication between and some
                        negotiation between these two great super powers, the People's Republic and
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>I have put this in general terms because that is the understanding of the
                        People's Republic, Premier <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou
                            En-lai</persName>, and it is our under-standing our agenda will be
                        worked out at a later point; before the trip it will be very carefully
                        worked out so that the discussions will deal with the hard problems as well
                        as the easy ones.</p>
                    <p>We expect to make some progress, but to speculate about what progress will be
                        made on any particular issue, to speculate, for example, as to what effect
                        this might have on Vietnam, would not serve the interests of constructive
                        talks.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are brief opening comments by the President and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>[<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>:] The President asked that
                        the Defense budget be presented in terms of missions, but the most
                        fundamental questions are still unanswered. Substantial work needs to be
                        done to define the purposes of our forces.</p>
                    <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0351"/>
                    <p>There has been an extraordinary shift in the strategic balance since the
                        mid-1960's. Until the late 1950's we could win a general war whether we
                        struck first or not. Our general purpose forces could deal with any local
                        conflict—Cuba, for example. But today Soviet strategic forces are far
                        stronger. If a country has superiority, one doesn't have to worry about a
                        disarming first strike. Local situations therefore take on added
                        significance.</p>
                    <p>Most of our strategic doctrine reflects decisions under the conditions of
                        previous periods. Thus there are some anomalies and questions, that are not
                        yet resolved.</p>
                    <p>Let me review some of the types of forces and questions we have. This is not
                        intended to be all-inclusive.</p>
                    <p>First, strategic nuclear forces. What are the missions of these forces? They
                        are: deterrence; second-strike assured destruction; to save American lives;
                        a China <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> against small attacks; some
                        counterforce capability (particularly against Communist China); also
                        strategic interdiction against non-urban targets.</p>
                    <p>In fact we have no disarming capability against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> but we do have some against China. But we cannot use our
                        land-based missiles against China (over <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>); we have to use our bombers and submarines. Thus we must
                        decide whether to dedicate a part of our force. And do we have the
                        intelligence capability to define the targets? As long as we have a
                        disarming capability we can use it to regulate their actions in local
                        situations.</p>
                    <p>We still confront <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> problems. We are
                        still targeting silos without a retargeting capability. Thus we risk firing
                        at empty holes. Why should we use bombers to go after missiles that are
                        already fired? The approach of the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>
                        hasn't changed much in 10 years. Our strategic forces are inferior in
                        numbers but still carrying functions that are the same as when we had
                        superiority.</p>
                    <p>As for strategic defensive forces: Our fighters are superior in numbers to
                        theirs, but when we send them they fight their offensive fighters. The
                        question is why would the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> conduct
                        small air attacks against the U.S. when it can do it with missiles? There
                        are other issues here also—what about Safeguard and <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss>?</p>
                    <p>Then we come to theater nuclear forces: We still don't have a clear doctrine
                        for their use. Thus we can't define how many are needed. Why do we depend on
                        vulnerable short-range artillery to deliver them? How would a war progress
                        after the use of nuclear weapons? We have the same problems in the Pacific.
                        Thus the problem is not resolved as to the types and numbers of forces that
                        we need.</p>
                    <p>Then come our general purpose forces. Their mission is forward defense in
                        Europe, and elsewhere to maintain a credible posture of <pb n="332"
                            xml:id="pg_332" facs="0352"/>defense. In <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> the problem has been to provide a capability of 90 days or
                        more of conventional defense in response to an all-out Warsaw Pact attack.
                        Thus the missions of the three forces—Soviet, U.S., and <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies—are different.</p>
                    <p>We can't get the allies to define what selective use of nuclear weapons
                        means.</p>
                    <p>I have seen no evidence of how we will get to M+60, let alone M+90 —but our
                        allies' supplies probably won't last that long. The problem is how the three
                        approaches can be taken at the same time.</p>
                    <p>There is some progress here, but we still have many unsolved problems in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In other parts of the world, there is less of a problem of having a
                        war-fighting capability; it is more a matter of the political presence of
                        the United States. In Korea, our forces are important to the political
                        context and their withdrawal would have a political impact in Korea and
                        Japan. If our forces in the Pacific drop precipitously, some will see this
                        as a move—misinterpreting the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        Doctrine—to withdraw. Air and naval forces are not enough. In the Middle
                        East we have a similar problem. In September 1970, the possible projection
                        of our ground forces was the key.</p>
                    <p>If the Army goes to 11 divisions, we will be short six divisions for our
                        plans in Europe and will have no strategic reserve. At 13 we are still short
                        of a strategic reserve.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the issues we are trying to discuss in the <gloss
                            target="#t_DPRC1">DPRC</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">Defense
                            Program Review Committee.</note> Some involve our allies, some have an
                        impact that is psychological. If we don't come to grips with them, the
                        consequences will be serious. The Soviets are not building missiles to be
                        nice. Somewhere their umbrella will be translated into political power. Thus
                        we want to continue this study.</p>
                    <p>The President: The main purpose of our forces is diplomatic wallop. The
                        possibility of nuclear conflict is remote, because the fear of it is so
                        widespread. We can't separate diplomatic power from the ability to deny to
                        the other side an ability to win a war without irreparable losses.</p>
                    <p>General purpose forces are irrelevant in a nuclear war. Carriers and ground
                        forces have a psychological effect in areas where nations depend on the
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. That's the reason for <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strength in Europe; that's why, if it was
                        only a trip wire, at some point it becomes incredible that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would support them. Our military plans are
                        probably irrelevant but it is important that our presence be there because
                        people see the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> continuing to play a role
                        in the world. This supports our <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0353"
                        />diplomatic posture generally. They know the minimums are political
                        minimums.</p>
                    <p>While we are negotiating with Soviets and we may negotiate with China, those
                        in Europe and elsewhere who are under the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        defense umbrella get nervous. They think we may change the power balance,
                        and they will look elsewhere for their guarantees. Germany and Japan both
                        look to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> guarantees for their
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Mel and Dave<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">Secretary of Defense <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin E. Laird</persName> and Deputy Secretary of
                            Defense <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">David Packard</persName>.</note> are
                        well aware that many in the Congress applaud our negotiating for the wrong
                        reasons. They think negotiating means no need for forces. This is clearly
                        the wrong trend. Jackson was attacked by Lowenstein.</p>
                    <p>We are in a position to have in effect a two-stage policy: To give hope that
                        we are negotiating and maybe in the long-run can reduce our military burden.
                        But at the same time we know we couldn't have come this far without a
                        credible military posture—nor could we bug out in Vietnam. Any possibility
                        for continued progress in the future with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and China—who are continuing to build their military
                        strength—will depend on our military strength.</p>
                    <p>We have a problem of public relations. Many don't care what position we have.
                        We must explain our attitude and that of the unilateral disarmers. What will
                        the people and the Congress support? We also have economic, budget and
                        balance of payments problems. But I can't accept the argument that these
                        must govern. There is a level beyond which defense can't be reduced—it is
                        most important for diplomatic and psychological purposes.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is a summary of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973 Defense
                        budget considerations presented by <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                            >Laird</persName>, with some discussion.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Irwin</persName>:<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">
                            <persName>John N. Irwin</persName>, II, Under Secretary of State.</note>
                        You emphasized our concern: the diplomatic and psychological effects of
                        budget reductions. We understand the problem. In strategic forces,
                        sufficiency must be believable to all. In <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, we also must maintain our commitment. Any Navy cuts
                        should be elsewhere than in the Mediterranean. We have been pursuing the
                        interim Suez agreements and our diplomatic effort must be supported by naval
                        and air power in the region.</p>
                    <p>In East Asia, the political and psychological factor is the most important.
                        All our friends are concerned about the possible outcome of the war in
                        Vietnam and the effects on them of our China initiative. They see a change
                        in the power balance—our allies are watching us closely. <pb n="334"
                            xml:id="pg_334" facs="0354"/>Therefore it is essential to maintain our
                        flexibility and our deployments. Under either of Mel's budgets we would be
                        cutting one division in the Pacific. We need to maintain the divisions, the
                        air wings and two carrier task forces; to move any of them would unhinge our
                        allies there. In Japan, they are already nervous; they could be pushed to
                        rearm, even to nuclear armaments.</p>
                    <p>I don't rule out reductions in the future but not in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 73. It would be the wrong time. Secretary <persName

                        his strong view.</p>

                    <p>The President began the meeting by noting that at that moment the
                        announcement he would shortly be reading out to the Leaders was being
                        simultaneously published in Washington and Moscow. The President said that
                        after reading the announcement he would provide some background and then be
                        open to questions. He looked forward to a good discussion in this small
                        group. The President then read out the announcement concerning his trip to
                        the Soviet Union in May, 1972 (Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Not

                            agreement to hold a Summit meeting in Moscow in late May 1972. The

                    <p>Turning to the background, the President recalled his first press conference
                        in January of 1969 when the question of a summit with the Soviets was
                        raised. At that time he had said that we should not have such a meeting
                        unless something came out of it, otherwise it would be merely cosmetic and
                        there would be a great letdown. This also turned out to be the Soviet view.
                        In April, 1970, the Soviets began exploring the possibility at lower levels.
                        But the President did not think that a meeting at the highest level at that
                        time could serve a useful purpose. There then ensued a period of many
                        discussions at various levels. In the last few weeks the Soviets indicated
                        that they thought the time was ripe and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                            >Gromyko</persName> brought a formal invitation when he came to
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that in fact we had made sufficient progress. He
                        cited agreements on biological warfare, the seabeds, the hot line and
                        accidental war. But the most important one was on Berlin. That problem was
                        not solved totally but the United States and the Soviet Union, plus the two
                        other countries involved, were able to reach agreement on an area where our
                        interests clashed.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">According to notes of a
                            Cabinet meeting held later that day taken by Assistant to the President

                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said of these accomplishments:
                            “Any one of them would have been hailed as the second coming if achieved
                            by another President.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                            22-December 5, 1971)</note> Now the President drew the conclusion that
                        it was possible to go to other areas.</p>
                    <p>The President then took up the point of why the meeting was set for May
                        rather than, for example, next month. In the first place, he said, the
                        Soviets set the date. In addition, we were having very intensive
                        negotiations on strategic arms. While we were aiming for agreement this year
                        it might not come until next year. The subject was high on the agenda. In
                        this connection, the President referred to recent stories about the huge
                        Soviet arms build-up, particularly on the Soviet side. While <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> had made progress on the defensive side,
                        agreement would not be reached without the offensive side because that was
                        where the Soviets were ahead. We cannot have an agreement based on defensive
                        equality but freezing Soviet offensive advantage. The President was
                        confident that we would have a <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement but it must not freeze us into inferiority.</p>
                    <p>The President cautioned against euphoria in connection with this Moscow trip.
                        There continued to be great differences: in the Caribbean and Southeast
                        Asia, in Europe and, most fundamentally as regards systems of government.
                        Nevertheless the overwhelming fact was that if there ever was a superpower
                        conflict there would be no victors, only losers. The Soviets know this as
                        well as we do. Neither superpower <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0356"
                        />would let the other get an advantage sufficient to enable it to launch a
                        preemptive strike. Therefore, we should explore areas where we can limit or
                        even perhaps reduce arms.</p>
                    <p>Apart from arms, there were such problems as Europe and trade. Without
                        listing an agenda, the President said the Moscow talks would deal with all
                        “questions of mutual interest.” This included peripheral areas like the
                        Middle East, where we hoped for progress before the summit; Southeast Asia
                        and its future, where we will go forward with our two-track policy and will
                        not wait until May; and the Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, the President said when we look at the future of the world
                        negotiations rather than confrontations were essential. It did not matter if
                        we had a difference with a small country like Bolivia, but in the case of
                        the Soviet Union it could be disastrous. The President then stressed that
                        the two trips he was planning—to Peking and Moscow—were completely separate
                        and independent. We were in the position of pursuing the best relations with
                        both, but not with one at the expense of the other.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d97fn4">
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> also told the Cabinet,
                            according to Price's notes, that “we are on a very high wire. We are
                            trying to stay there vis-à-vis the Soviet Union and China. We must
                            remember that we are ironically in a position where each rates the other
                            as a greater enemy than the U.S. But the U.S.—to deal with either—must
                            deal evenhandedly, not playing off one against the other.”
                            (Ibid.)</note> The President added that we had informed Peking, the
                        European allies and Japan of the Moscow trip, but because of the Soviet
                        passion for secrecy, which they share with other communists, we had to be
                        extremely careful not to risk a leak.</p>

                    <p>On October 27, 1971, on his return from China, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Henry Kissinger</persName> held a press conference in the White House
                        Briefing Room. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was in China
                        October 20-27 to continue planning for the upcoming Presidential trip to
                        China. Unlike the first visit, the second trip was announced publicly
                        beforehand. For <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s account
                        of this trip, see <hi rend="italic">White House Years,</hi> pages 776-785.
                        When asked during the press conference whether there was any discussion with
                        the Chinese of the upcoming Moscow Summit, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> responded:</p>

                    <p>“First of all, let me say that I will not comment on any of the substantive
                        discussions. But I do want to take this opportunity to make the following
                        point: Our relations with the People's Republic of China are designed to end
                        the isolation from each other of two great peoples. It is an attempt to
                        settle or to begin the long process of settlement of outstanding issues
                        between two peoples who have had a history of friendship.</p>
                    <p>“It is not directed against any third country. Neither side is going to use
                        the discussions that will come up as an opportunity to discuss the possible
                        settlement of issues that primarily affect third countries. Therefore, we do
                        not feel, nor does the People's Republic require us to give an account of
                        whatever dealings we might have with other countries.</p>
                    <p>“This, incidentally, this precise rule, will be applied in our relationship
                        with Moscow. Whatever differences may or may not exist between the People's
                        Republic of China and the Soviet Union are for them to discuss among
                        themselves. We have a long agenda of bilateral issues to discuss with both
                        of them. This is going to be the exclusive concern of the President when he
                        visits first Peking and then Moscow.” (White House Press Release, October

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of general subjects.]</p>
                    <p>First, the President said, he believed that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> knew that, while the U.S. had many
                        faults, it was not a threat to the independence of smaller countries. It was
                        certainly not a threat to Yugoslavia, which could have trade and other
                        relations with the U.S. but should not fear any interference on the part of
                        the United States. The U.S. was not saintly, but from the standpoint of its
                        own self-interest—and any country must act on the basis of its
                        self-interest—it believed that its interests would be served by the
                        existence of strong independent nations like Yugoslavia. We realized,
                        however, that <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>, with his big
                        neighbor to the North, and Yugoslavia, which was in the same sphere but
                        somewhat further removed, had a special problem. While he did not know
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> or <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> personally, there was no question
                        in his mind that, because of its self-interest, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> would continue its efforts to bring its neighbors under
                        increased influence. The independence of Yugoslavia and Romania, regardless
                        of these two countries' internal systems, was consistent with U.S. interests
                        but was not consistent with Soviet interests.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> interjected that there
                        were great differences between Romania and Yugoslavia, with the President
                        commenting that President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> would
                        still admit that he had been a thorn in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>'s side, not because he wanted it but because his
                        independent policy was disliked by the Soviets. The problem of the countries
                        in that area was to have good relations with the United States but without
                        going so far as to provoke the Soviets into using their might to stop
                        movement toward independence. In this connection, the President observed
                        that one of the <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0359"/>major questions to
                        be discussed in Moscow would be the U.S. attitude towards the Eastern bloc.
                        Our position would not be that of liberation; as Hungary had shown,
                        liberation meant suicide. However, the President stressed, his position
                        would be to avoid any kind of understanding with Moscow that would give the
                        Soviets encouragement to fish in troubled waters in Yugoslavia or elsewhere.
                        He felt that he did not have to say more than that.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Soviet relations with Yugoslavia and Eastern
                        Europe.]</p>
                    <p>The President said that another question he wished to discuss with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was our arms talks with the
                        Soviets, because those talks were very important from the standpoint of what
                        other states would do for their defense. Noting that we hoped to reach
                        agreement with the Soviets on limiting both offensive and defensive
                        strategic armaments, the President said that he wished to point out at the
                        same time that if no such agreement was reached he would have to make a
                        decision to increase our armaments. As things stood now, the Soviets were
                        making great efforts to enlarge their arsenal of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>s, SS-9s and <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s. While
                        we could not object to Soviet efforts to reach parity with the United
                        States, we could not stand by if another nation was gaining superiority.
                        Therefore, if no agreement was reached, we would have to increase our arms
                        spending by $15 to $20 billion, and he, the President, was prepared to do
                        it. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> expressed the
                        view that it was important for the U.S. to discuss arms control with the
                        Soviet Union because if agreement was reached in this area, that would make
                        it easier to reach agreement on other issues as well.</p>
                    <p>The President continued that in certain parts of the world, some seemed to
                        believe that given our winding up some commitments, our Vietnam policy, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine, and our moves
                        regarding China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he was so
                        concerned about peace that he would make a move for peace even if that
                        should weaken U.S. defenses. This, the President emphasized, was a gross
                        miscalculation. The U.S. was a Pacific power, and it intended to remain such
                        a power because it had interests in the area. If others were to limit their
                        armaments, the U.S. would do the same, but it would not do it
                        unilaterally.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled the remark in his toast the other night, that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was a man of
                            peace.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">For text of the toast, see <hi

                            p. 1067-1068.</note> In a very personal way, he wanted to say that
                        although President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s and his
                        own backgrounds were different and his role in history had not been as great
                        as President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s, there were also
                        some similarities. Both President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                            >Tito</persName> and himself had <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0360"
                        />come up the hard way. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                            >Tito</persName> was for peace, and he considered himself to be a man of
                        peace too. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was for
                        independence, just as he was a strong believer in independence. He also
                        respected different social systems; President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                            >Tito</persName> might be a communist and he a capitalist but this did
                        not matter. However, one thing should be clear, and that was that he,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, was not a soft man.
                        The U.S. was not interested in peace at any cost, and this would be made
                        very clear in the forthcoming discussions with the Chinese and the Soviets.
                        Nor would the U.S. make any arrangement with the Chinese or the Soviets at
                        the expense of third countries. The President continued that it was his firm
                        conviction that a weak United States would be a danger to peace, although
                        some Senators held a different view and called for unilateral disarmament.
                        He did not believe in such disarmament, especially if the other side was
                        building up its armaments. In this connection, the President noted that some
                        leaders on which President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> had
                        influence might criticize the United States for increasing its military
                        strength, but that he firmly believed that this served the interests of
                        peace. President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> said that the
                        nations the President was referring to did not criticize the United States
                        for strengthening its defenses but rather for its inadequate participation
                        in their development. Many of those nations were tired of hearing only words
                        about such participation and wanted to see some action.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are introductory comments.]</p>
                    <p>I think you will agree with me when I say that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> came to office with an experience in
                        foreign affairs matched by few of his predecessors. A review of his public
                        statements shortly before and after he assumed office foreshadowed the major
                        initiatives that this administration has taken. Yet few would have been
                        willing to predict their sweep. They can be broadly stated this way:</p>
                    <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0361"/>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, maximum practical efforts in every forum to achieve a more
                            peaceful world, as with the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>

                            talks;</item>
                        <item>Second, concerted action to achieve a better balance of
                            responsibilities to reflect the growing shift in political-economic
                            power in the world; for example, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> doctrine, which has resulted in the reduction of
                            more than 420,000 men from East Asia, and the new economic
                            policy;</item>
                        <item>Third, intensive diplomatic activity to improve relations throughout
                            the world in order to provide a foundation for a generation of peace, as
                            illustrated by the President's forthcoming trips to Peking and
                            Moscow.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Basic to this third point is a fundamental and often ignored concept in
                        foreign affairs—that nations do not have permanent enemies, only permanent
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>I will not attempt to cite the various initiatives the President has
                        undertaken to carry out these objectives, because you are all well aware of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Rather, tonight I want to speak briefly about the U.S. relationship with
                        Europe—about our permanent interests and, in the true sense of the word, our
                        permanent friends. In each of the permanent interests of United States
                        foreign policy—security, economic well-being, peace—Europe continues to play
                        a central role. Europe's security is indivisible from our own. Europe's
                        economic strength reinforces our own. And as the President has said, “if we
                        are to found a structure of peace on the collaboration of many nations, our
                        ties with Western Europe must be its cornerstone.”<note n="3"

                        fundamental to our foreign policy. We hope it will not be forgotten by our
                        friends in Europe.</p>
                    <p>It is more than symbolic, then, that the President has scheduled meetings
                        with President Pompidou, Prime Ministers <persName corresp="#p_HERG1"
                            >Heath</persName>, Trudeau, Caetano, and Chancellor Brandt and that
                        within a few days I will be attending a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers meeting. These consultations are all
                        important aspects of implementing our foreign policy, in which our relations
                        with Western Europe remain of fundamental importance. They will give the
                        President and members of his administration an opportunity to discuss in
                        person the visits he will be making to Peking and Moscow, economic and
                        monetary issues, and other matters of common interest.</p>

                    <p>Europe today is in an important period of transition, a transition embodying
                        two processes. The first, the process toward integration of Western Europe,
                        is progressing rapidly. The second, a process toward reconciliation between
                        countries in Eastern and Western Europe, appears to be beginning.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government fully supports both of these. Since the days of
                        the Marshall Plan the unity and strength of Western Europe have been central
                        objectives of American foreign policy; we will not cease to be active
                        supporters of these objectives now that they are on the threshold of
                        success. And we are no less determined to participate actively in the
                        process of reducing the political and social barriers which still divide the
                        European Continent.</p>
                    <p>In the process toward Western European integration, we have always known
                        that, as Western Europeans developed collective policies and a collective
                        identity, their views and ours would not always coincide and transitory
                        differences would develop.</p>
                    <p>In the economic field this has happened from time to time over the years, but
                        we have resolved our disputes without damaging the underlying strength of
                        our relationship.</p>
                    <p>We realize that the international aspects of the economic policy announced by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> last August<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d100fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s so-called “New Economic Policy,” which he
                            announced in an address to the nation on August 15. With respect to
                            foreign policy, the address focused on protection of the American dollar
                            as a pillar of monetary stability throughout the world. Text of the
                            address is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        Western Europeans. We believe that they understand why we had to take
                        drastic action to correct a balance of payments deficit running at three
                        times the 1970 rate. It is not our intention, of course, to damage the
                        economies of our allies and friends or to impair the system of economic
                        cooperation which has served all of us so well over the past quarter of a
                        century.</p>
                    <p>Since August 15, we have consulted closely with the principal industrial and
                        financial nations about the measures we have taken. There is a wider measure
                        of agreement among us than is evident from some of the public comment on the
                        subject. There is a recognition that exchange rates had gotten out of line
                        and that a substantial realignment is necessary if the international system
                        is to function effectively. There is understanding that we have unfinished
                        and urgent business of major importance in the area of trade rules and trade
                        practices to insure freer and fairer trade. There is no disagreement that
                        the burden of the common defense should be shared more equitably and that
                        multilateral <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0363"/>efforts must be
                        intensified to accomplish this result. We believe that mutually beneficial
                        solutions can and will be worked out.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, whatever our contemporary economic problems, the broadest interests
                        of Western Europe and of the United States remain inseparable. And neither
                        these nor any other problems will cause us to abandon our support of Western
                        European alliance or our commitment to a strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> alliance.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, there is, of course, no intention on our part—as has been
                            suggested in some quarters—to exploit the economic situation to try to
                            divide Western European countries from each other. We hope Western
                            Europe will continue to speak with unity and cohesion in the economic as
                            in other fields.</item>
                        <item>Second, while we firmly believe that defense burdens should be shared
                            more equitably, economic differences and problems have not caused us to
                            change our views on the maintenance of U.S. forces in Europe. As

                            steadfastness of purpose on this point should be clear from the
                            determination and success with which we have continued to oppose
                            attempts in the United States Senate to cut U.S. forces in Europe
                            unilaterally.</item>

                            Western Europe. Rather, in recognition of U.S.-Western European
                            interdependence in all these fields, we will remain committed and
                            involved.</item>

                    <p>This, then, is the message that the President has asked me to take next week
                        to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers meeting in
                        Brussels: that America's partnership with Western Europe and America's
                        commitment to its defense are undiminished.</p>
                    <p>At that meeting the allies will be concerned, too, with the second process I
                        have referred to—the movement toward reconciliation in Europe as a whole. In
                        particular, we will be discussing two elements in that process, the mutual
                        and balanced force reductions (MBFR) and a conference on European security
                        and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We hope that it will soon be possible to move into more definitive
                        preparations for a negotiation on force reductions. At the Deputy <pb

                        October, former <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Secretary General
                        [Manlio] Brosio was named to explore Soviet views on approaches to
                        negotiation. We regret that the Soviet Government, despite its earlier
                        public assertions of willingness to proceed at once to negotiations, has not
                        agreed to receive Mr. <persName>Brosio</persName>. We hope it will do so
                        soon.</p>
                    <p>Concern has been expressed in certain quarters in Western Europe that the
                        United States Government may consider the discussion on force reductions as
                        little more than a cover for American troop withdrawals. This concern is
                        without any foundation. We have no interest in an agreement which would
                        alter the conventional-force balance in Europe to the West's disadvantage.
                        Only reciprocal withdrawals which are carefully balanced could be
                        contemplated. Only such withdrawals can contribute to the overall process of
                        East-West reconciliation to which we and our allies are committed. Together
                        with our allies we must make certain that all proposals for force reductions
                        are carefully examined for their security implications.</p>

                    <p>Another step in the process of reconciliation which will receive active
                        consideration at the coming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting is
                        a conference on European security and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has made clear that it would not
                        engage in preparations for such a conference until the Berlin negotiations
                        were successfully concluded. The first phase of the Berlin agreement was
                        signed by the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
                        France in September. The second phase, the talks between East and West
                        Germany, has now reached the point of decision. If those talks succeed—and
                        there is now every reason to believe they will—the four powers would
                        subsequently proceed toward the signing of a final protocol bringing the
                        entire Berlin agreement into effect. When this would occur is uncertain at
                        the present time because of the Soviet Union's insistence that it will not
                        sign the protocol until the time of the ratification of the treaty between
                        the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. They insist that it be
                        done simultaneously. The United States, for its part, would be prepared to
                        sign the final protocol as soon as the results of the German negotiations
                        have been found acceptable. And we expect this to occur very soon.</p>
                    <p>However, when the protocol is signed—so that a satisfactory solution to the
                        question of Berlin is an accomplished fact—the way will be open for concrete
                        preparations during the coming year for a conference. In this connection we
                        would be prepared to support the convening of a special <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Deputy Foreign Ministers meeting to
                        consider ways to proceed.</p>
                    <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0365"/>
                    <p>Let me outline the basic United States approach to such a conference.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, we believe that a conference should emphasize substance
                        over atmosphere. It must attempt to mitigate the underlying causes of
                        tension, not merely its superficial manifestations. It should therefore deal
                        with any security issues on the agenda in a concrete way.</p>
                    <p>In the second place, we believe that the discussions could usefully address
                        the basic principles that should govern relations among states. A conference
                        should encourage the reconciliation of sovereign European states, not
                        confirm their division. The conference could help make this clear by
                        affirming—as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> affirmed in
                        October—the independence and equality of sovereign states, whether their
                        political or social systems are different or similar.</p>
                    <p>In the third place, we believe that a conference should give major emphasis
                        to issues of cooperation on which East-West progress is attainable. While a
                        conference might contribute to enhanced security, the progress achieved on
                        Berlin and in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks suggests that
                        detailed negotiation of individual security issues is more likely to be
                        handled in less general and less highly visible forums.</p>
                    <p>A conference could, however, stimulate cooperation in Europe toward increased
                        East-West trade, toward more frequent and more useful exchanges of science
                        and technology, and toward common efforts to preserve the human
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>In the fourth place, we believe that a conference should go beyond the
                        traditional pattern of cultural exchanges between East and West. It should
                        take specific steps to encourage the freer movement of people, ideas, and
                        information.</p>
                    <p>In general, we would view a conference on European security and cooperation
                        in dynamic rather than static terms. We would firmly oppose any attempt to
                        use it to perpetuate the political and social division of Europe. We would
                        see a conference not as a ratification of the existing divisions but as a
                        step on the long road to a new situation—a situation in which the causes of
                        tension are fewer, contacts are greater, and the continent could once more
                        be thought of as Europe rather than as two parts.</p>

                    <p>I have spoken of our efforts with our allies to lessen tensions and improve
                        relations with the peoples and states of Eastern Europe. In our bilateral
                        efforts as well, we are seeking the same objectives and making progress. As
                        you know, we have been making progress in the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> talks. The success of Secretary [of Commerce Maurice H.]

                        first American President to visit the Soviet Union in 27 years. As the
                        official announcement of the trip made clear, both we and the Soviets had
                        agreed that a summit meeting “would be desirable once sufficient progress
                        had been made in negotiations at lower levels.”<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6"

                            473. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> We are pleased that such
                        progress is taking place.</p>
                    <p>The objectives of the President's visit—to improve bilateral relations and
                        enhance the prospects for peace—cannot be attained, nor will they be sought,
                        at the expense of the other countries of Europe, Eastern or Western. Indeed,
                        we are prepared to improve and expand our relations with the Eastern
                        European states at whatever pace they are willing to maintain. Good
                        beginnings have been made. In bilateral trade, the area in which the Soviet
                        Union's allies have shown the greatest interest, the total is expected to
                        reach $415 million this year; although still small, it is an increase of
                        more than 50 percent since 1967. We hope to increase it substantially in
                        years to come.</p>
                    <p>We welcome the authority President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> was given by Congress to approve Export-Import Bank
                        financing of trade with Eastern Europe. Yesterday, as you know, the
                        President notified Congress of his intention to apply this authority to
                        Romania, and we have some possibilities under active consideration now to
                        carry out in practice that authority.</p>
                    <p>Other Eastern European countries, notably Poland and Hungary, have also shown
                        a desire for improvement in their relations with us. We reciprocate this
                        desire and are responding to it. With Poland, for example, our overall trade
                        already approaches in volume our trade with the Soviet Union, and we hope
                        further steps will soon be possible to increase it.</p>
                    <p>Our approach in Eastern Europe, as elsewhere, corresponds to the words of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s inaugural address
                        in 1969: “We seek an open world—open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods
                        and people—a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry
                        isolation.”</p>
                    <p>There are voices in this country calling for United States withdrawal from
                        the affairs of Europe. Such withdrawal would be folly. It would not be in
                        the interests of our allies. It would not be in the interests of a more
                        peaceful and more open European Continent. It would not be in the permanent
                        interests of the United States.</p>

                    <p>Therefore we will work to strengthen our partnership with our allies in
                        Western Europe. We will work to improve our relations with the states of
                        Eastern Europe. And we will work to help clear the way for more stable and
                        cooperative relationships within the whole of Europe.</p>

                    <p>When this Administration came to power at the beginning of 1969, we found
                        ourselves in a period with the foreign policy capital of the post-war era
                        virtually exhausted. That era was one in which the United States was the
                        sole nation of the non-Communist world with power sufficient to run foreign
                        affairs. Following the Second World War the traditional powers were
                        shattered economically and had domestic structures that would not sustain
                        the active conduct of foreign policy. At the same time the emerging nations
                        were still looking for power. They had not achieved it. During that era,
                        throughout the non-Communist world questions of security and progress
                        depended on answers from the United States. It came to be the view of the
                        other nations that their security and progress was of more interest to the
                        United States than it was to them themselves. As a reflection of that,
                        foreign affairs for them came to be little more than lobbying efforts in the
                        United States for action by our government. This situation, of course,
                        simply could not last.</p>
                    <p>In the subsequent period we have seen Europe and Japan both grow enormously
                        in their economic and military potential. Japan by <pb n="348"
                            xml:id="pg_348" facs="0368"/>now has one of the largest economies in the
                        world. During that same period we have seen the Communist world split; and
                        now, surprisingly enough, the most significant political split in the world
                        is not between the Communists and the non-Communists, but within the
                        Communist world between Russia and China. So the whole international balance
                        had changed by the time this Administration came into power: first, due to
                        the growth of the power of our friends, and second, due to the growth of the
                        power of our enemies.</p>
                    <p>As an example, in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>'s supporters were proud to say that
                        the President had gone to the edge of cataclysm to prevent intrusion in the
                        Western Hemisphere. At that time, the Russians had some 70 intercontinental
                        ballistic missiles: all were standing in the open, and required ten hours to
                        fuel. By the time this Administration came into power in 1969, the Russians
                        had 1200 missiles, all in hard sites, and they had a constantly growing
                        fleet of missile-armed submarines. So during this era, decisions about peace
                        and war in the international area have been taken under circumstances
                        drastically different from those which prevailed in the 1960's.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans, most of all, have been slowly recognizing the changes in the
                        international order. On the other side of the iron curtain, of course, there
                        have also been significant changes. Russia was torn between her
                        revolutionary ideology and the management of her national bureaucracy. And
                        the Russians found themselves in a situation where their national economy
                        could not continue to support revolutionary foreign policy. Interestingly
                        enough also, Russia's main enemy turned out to lie in Asia, and to be
                        Communist (that is to say China) and not to be as traditionally though, in
                        Western Europe. And this, of course, was not long after the Russians were
                        wont to celebrate the Communist feats of the Chinese. As a further shock to
                        Russia the Chinese have chosen to deal now with the least dangerous of the
                        four major powers that it sees in the world—the United States. In any case
                        this is the situation that we faced in 1969, and to which we have tried to
                        adjust.</p>
                    <p>Among the requirements of this new adjustment was to leave behind an attitude
                        from the post-war foreign policy era that engagement itself was an end to be
                        sought. Such engagements throughout the world have become beyond our
                        resources, not only physically but also psychologically.</p>
                    <p>I have been asked not infrequently what I have learned from this job. In
                        attempting to answer that, let me say that humility is not one of my
                        strongest virtues. Later, after I leave this job, I may have a better
                        perspective on what I have learned. But I will say that working outside the
                        government the toughest problem I found was to identify issues. Once I had
                        identified an issue, I could work to the best of my ability in reaching <pb
                            n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0369"/>whatever solution seemed
                        appropriate. Here in the government I find that there is no problem about
                        getting the issues: they pile up in my “In-Box” every day. The problem here
                        is how to get time to deal with them.</p>
                    <p>You all probably know that a large number of articles exist on the subject of
                        policy planning. In fact, I myself have authored some scholarly (if not
                        learned) articles of that nature. But I will tell you gentlemen tonight that
                        concepts about policy planning are entirely esoteric if the issues involved
                        cannot get to the policy-makers in the limit with which we realistically
                        have to deal. If we were to try to take on the entire world in our foreign
                        policy, the mere quantity of work that would be produced would just simply
                        be too great to be handled by our top decision-makers. The greater our
                        involvement in the world, the more the railroad train which always seems to
                        be coming down the track toward you is likely to hit you. And while the
                        chance that the train will hit you is growing enormously, your ability to
                        deal thoughtfully with issues is of course declining.</p>
                    <p>The policy of this Administration is not to withdraw from the world; it is to
                        maintain an involvement in the world—an involvement under a policy that we
                        are capable of maintaining. In the non-Communist world this is the <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. The basic premise of this
                        doctrine is that we cannot expect to defend others beyond the point where
                        they cannot defend themselves. Intellectually, organizationally, they must
                        take the lead. Key here are psychological factors. We want the top
                        policy-makers around the world to think for themselves, to organize
                        regionally on their own, not to come automatically to the United States for
                        answers to their problems. We are not going to withdraw from the world; this
                        is surely evidenced by our continuing fight against amendments to limit our
                        capacities around the world attached to the appropriation bills in Congress.
                        We are going to demand more from the other nations of the world
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Now let me turn for a moment to address our adversaries. We face two entirely
                        different situations. The Soviet Union is a highly developed Communist
                        society. The Chinese have a society which is in infancy. There is a peculiar
                        nostalgia that leads Americans to believe that all the peoples of the world
                        are secretly Americans. I have often said that the Americans hold the view
                        that if you caught a Britisher off guard, when he didn't know you were
                        listening, for instance, at 4 a.m. in the morning, he would drop that phony
                        British accent and talk like an American. (Laughter) This nostalgia is
                        reflected in the traditional view that our differences with the Russians
                        must be reflections of mere personal misunderstandings and that the remedy
                        for national differences is the development of interpersonal good will. The
                        theory was that if we could only <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0370"
                        />show the Russians we are regular guys, our problems would be resolved.</p>
                    <p>Now this theory is one that the Russians have gone along with when it has
                        been convenient for them. This has led us to a history of brief periods of
                        détente followed inevitably by periods of increased tensions. The
                        inevitability of these increased tensions is evidenced by the fact that they
                        have regularly reappeared over the last fifty years of relationship with the
                        Russians. They must have some basis in fact other than personal
                        misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>The policy of this Administration, and it was reflected in the President's
                        first press conference, has been not to talk about tensions with the
                        Russians. We are not going to confuse foreign policy with psychotherapy.
                        What we want to do is deal with concrete issues in our relationships, and we
                        must avoid giving the Russians the impression that realities can be affected
                        by changes in the atmospherics and personal relationships; otherwise, they
                        would have no incentive to settle the real problems that exist between
                        us.</p>
                    <p>An example of what I am talking about occurred early in the Administration.
                        We had a problem about businessmen wanting licenses to deal with Russia.
                        Businessmen kept coming to the White House with threats that they were going
                        to do grave things when they got back to their Board of Directors if we
                        didn't “okay” new trade with Russia. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>'s first press conference outlined the Administration
                        policy of viewing all foreign problems as inter-related. This is a policy
                        sometimes called “linkage”—a policy we deny in words but carry out in
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1970 there was surely evidence to the Russians that we were
                        serious about dealing on concrete issues. There was the Middle East crisis,
                        the frustration of trying to reach progress on the German question, the
                        Cuban problem, and our firm position on the Polish uprising. Subsequent to
                        that, we have seen dramatic progress in <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss> negotiations, in Berlin (an area that brought the world
                        four times in the post-war era to the brink of war), and in other areas. In
                        addition, we have seen an opening of trade. The period immediately following
                        this one may not be one of an expanding trade, at least prior to the
                        consolidation of political advances commensurate with already expanded
                        trade. But I do predict, gentlemen, that if those political advances
                        continue we will see a tremendous growth in trade with the Russians.</p>
                    <p>Let me say (and by the way let me take this opportunity to confirm that my
                        remarks this evening are totally off-the-record), that one might say that
                        the Russians can be characterized as slightly thuggish bureaucrats, whereas
                        the Chinese are more like fanatical monks. As we confront the Chinese, we
                        confront a young society which has been totally <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351"
                            facs="0371"/>isolated from us for some 22 years. China is a nation that
                        does not impinge upon us except in our relations with Taiwan. The Russians
                        are in a different situation. With them we have numerous, precise issues and
                        conflicts.</p>
                    <p>In China our problem is in setting a basic direction of foreign affairs. What
                        we must identify is a long-range direction, and I mean a direction for the
                        next five to ten years. We must use our opening to identify those areas in
                        which we have conflicting interests and those areas in which there is no
                        such conflict (and cooperation is possible). Our meeting with the Russians
                        will likely result in specific objective agreements; but at the Chinese
                        summit the communiqué which results will not be the key to the understanding
                        reached there. Most important will be a philosophical, intangible
                        understanding of motives and of the basic direction of our relationship.</p>
                    <p>As we deal with the Chinese we have no illusions about the depth of their
                        ideological hostility to us. But my experience with the Chinese to this
                        point leads me to reflect that they have an extraordinary depth of
                        understanding about the world situation. They demonstrate considerably
                        greater flexibility than the Russians in dealing with us. In the interim
                        phase with the Chinese our big task is going to be to show them that we are
                        serious enough to be dealt with.</p>
                    <p>As the Chinese approach relations with the United States, they have two basic
                        alternatives. First, they can deal with us in a revolutionary manner by
                        stirring up anti-government sentiment domestically. Second, they can deal
                        directly with the government of the United States. They have chosen the
                        second route, and we think that is a desirable route, and in the interest of
                        world peace. Of course, if that choice proves not to be fruitful, they could
                        revert to the revolutionary anti-government alternative. This gives you the
                        general direction that we are headed vis-à-vis the Communist world.</p>
                    <p>Let me say this Administration hopes that when the passions have cooled, and
                        history looks back on this period of foreign affairs, it will not be
                        remembered as the Administration which settled the Vietnam war (though we
                        certainly do intend to have the Vietnam war settled), but rather as the
                        Administration that set a new direction in foreign policy—a direction
                        desirable without regard to party affiliation—a new direction which would
                        contribute not only to the likelihood of international peace, but also to
                        the unity of the American nation. You know, one of the most serious things
                        that we have faced in this Administration has been the loss of moral support
                        from the American Establishment. By the loss of moral support I do not mean
                        the lack of agreement on individual issues, but rather the absence of a
                        feeling in foreign affairs that the nation is a unified and functioning
                        entity. <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0372"/>These, then, are the
                        foreign policy goals that this Administration seeks internationally, and
                        domestically (regarding the reintegration of American society).</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is discussion of bilateral and European political issues.]</p>
                    <p>The President then made an eloquent statement of his personal world view:
                        “The Establishment has a guilt complex. They can't stand the fact that I,
                        their political opponent, am rectifying their mistakes. In addition, the
                        Establishment has this growing obsession with domestic problems. The
                        intellectual establishment is confused and frustrated by their own role, and
                        by the United States' role. They have never believed that there was any real
                        danger from the Left. They are turning inward. They have made it a problem
                        whether we are going to continue our involvement in the world. The point of
                        this too-long discourse is this: I know the issue; I'll see it through; we
                        will have a world role. You'll wake up day after day wondering what's
                        happening to us. Our initiatives are necessary to give our people hope. A
                        political leader must constantly feed hope—but he must constantly know what
                        he is doing, without illusion. One reason these present visits are so
                        helpful is because the Right has become worried about our actions' impact on
                        our <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0373"/>friends. Our answer is that we
                        will not sacrifice our friends to détente. We must do it to keep our
                        negotiating partners.”</p>
                    <p>After some remarks on China policy by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, the President emphasized to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_HERG1">Heath</persName> that “We feel that you
                        should take an active role in world affairs. We must have better
                        communications. We should reach some sort of agreement on general
                        objectives. As for China, when you have two enemies, we want to tilt towards
                        the weaker, not towards the stronger—though not in a way that we can be
                        caught at it.” The President went on to discuss why we had to keep the
                        bureaucracy in the dark as we went about setting up the first <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> trip. “We'd like to keep you
                        informed on a personal basis,” he stressed to the Prime Minister. Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained why it was
                        not possible to inform allied governments any sooner before the July 15
                        announcement. The <gloss target="#t_ROC1">ROC</gloss> had a better claim to
                        advance notice than the Japanese had, but they would have leaked it. The
                        Japanese themselves have the leakiest government in the world, so we
                        couldn't afford to give them advance word.</p>
                    <p>The President said, “The Japanese are all over Asia like a bunch of lice.
                        Let's look at Japan and Germany: Both have a sense of frustration and a
                        memory of defeat. What must be done is to make sure we have a home for them.
                        Maybe <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is no longer relevant. Japan is
                        today denied a nuclear capability; in terms of security, if our nuclear
                        umbrella should become less credible, the effect on Japan would be a
                        catastrophe. The biggest reason for our holding on in Vietnam is Japan. (An
                        example of that is the impact the end of the bombing had on the Japanese.)
                        We have to reassure the Asians that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> Doctrine is not a way for us to get out of Asia but a
                        way for us to stay in. They must see that the China trip is not taken at
                        their expense. The August 15 thing was agony to me; I'm very glad that
                        Connally and Barber worked things out, because it was vital also for Japan.
                        Sato, you know, wanted to come to Hawaii.”</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the
                        Prime Minister noted. “We ought to tie them in.” The President agreed: “We
                        mustn't leave Japan completely isolated. We give aid stupidly; the Japanese
                        give aid too selfishly. We shouldn't resent that if the Japanese play a
                        constructive role ultimately; it won't necessarily be the same kind of role
                        as ours.”</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is brief discussion of South Asia.]</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then posed a philosophical question. “We are moving more
                        and more into a state of world affairs in which effective action is no
                        longer possible. How much can you do?” The President replied, “The Soviets
                        have tested us to see if they could control events. Of course you have to
                        consider the much bigger stakes in the Middle <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"
                            facs="0374"/>East and Europe. Part of the reason for conducting our
                        Vietnam withdrawal so slowly is to give some message that we are not
                        prepared to pay any price for ending a war; we must now ask ourselves what
                        we are willing to pay to avert war. If we are not, we have tough days
                        ahead.” [Omitted here are very brief comments on South Asia.]</p>

                    <p>On January 6, 1972, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        received Japanese Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                            >Eisaku</persName> Sato and Ambassador Nobuhiko Ushiba in San Clemente,
                        California. According to a memorandum of conversation prepared by John H.
                        Holdridge, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> presented a
                        multi-faceted analysis of the relationship among Japan, Europe, and the
                        United States, and its global economic impact:</p>
                    <p>“The President noted that the United States relationship with Europe differed
                        from its relationships in the Pacific. He said that he made the point with
                        each of the leaders he met (Pompidou, <persName corresp="#p_HERG1"
                            >Heath</persName>, and Brandt) that while we have a responsibility to
                        maintain the closest consultations between the United States and the major
                        European powers we must also work closely with Japan. The reason he believes
                        this important is that in viewing the Free World, the great economic powers,
                        the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, and possibly Canada must
                        consult closely if we are to build a stable and productive Free World
                        economy with trade and monetary stability. In a geopolitical sense also we
                        cannot view it in global terms. England, France, and Germany no longer
                        maintain a significant military presence in Asia, where Japan is the major
                        Free World nation. Therefore, he believed that the development of a 5-power
                        consultative process (adding Italy, perhaps, and Canada) would not only
                        serve the economic needs of the entire Free World, but would also contribute
                        to the development of cohesion in policy for handling all the difficult
                        political and security problems that arise.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then elaborated on the demands
                        of global security:</p>
                    <p>“The United States, the President added, is in a unique position, having
                        separate security treaties with Japan and the Western European nations, but
                        since its policy must be global the United States cannot separate the
                        two.”</p>
                    <p>Following a mention of European isolationism, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> concluded by speaking of his larger world view: <pb

                            <p>“The President stressed his belief that we all must inevitably

                                he believed it important to get the Europeans to think as we do in
                                the United States, that is, view the world as a whole, and to
                                recognize that Japan must be an important part of the Free World

                    <p>This is the third Report of this kind which I have made to the Congress. It
                        comes after a year of dramatic developments. The earlier Reports set forth
                        fully this Administration's analysis of the world situation. They expressed
                        the conviction that new conditions required fundamental changes in America's
                        world role. They expounded our conception of what that role should be.</p>
                    <p>In short, they foreshadowed a transformation of American foreign relations
                        with both our friends and our adversaries.</p>
                    <p>For three years, our policies have been designed to move steadily, and with
                        increasing momentum, toward that transformation.</p>
                    <p>1971 was the watershed year. The foundation laid and the cumulative effect of
                        the actions taken earlier enabled us to achieve, during the past year,
                        changes in our foreign policy of historic scope and significance: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>This Report is addressed to those and other developments. It is, however, a
                        companion piece to the two earlier Reports, for without an understanding of
                        the philosophical conception upon which specific actions were based, the
                        actions themselves can neither be adequately understood nor fairly judged.
                        This account of a year of intense action, therefore, properly begins with a
                        brief review of the intellectual foundation on which those actions rest.</p>
                    <p rend="center">A Changed World</p>
                    <p>In the first two Reports, I stressed the fact that the postwar period of
                        international relations had ended, and that it was the task of this
                        Administration to shape a new foreign policy to meet the requirements of a
                        new era. I set forth at some length the changes in the world which made a
                        new policy not only desirable, but necessary.</p>

                        this Administration was proceeding to reshape American <pb n="357"
                            xml:id="pg_357" facs="0377"/>policies to the requirements of the new
                        realities. The core principles of this philosophy are: <list>
                            <item>—A leading American role in world affairs continues to be
                                indispensable to the kind of world our own well-being
                                requires.</item>
                            <item>—The end of the bipolar postwar world opens to this generation a
                                unique opportunity to create a new and lasting structure of
                                peace.</item>
                            <item>—The end of bipolarity requires that the structure must be built
                                with the resources and concepts of many nations—for only when
                                nations participate in creating an international system do they
                                contribute to its vitality and accept its validity.</item>
                            <item>—Our friendships are constant, but the means by which they are
                                mutually expressed must be adjusted as world conditions change. The
                                continuity and vigor of our alliances require that our friends
                                assume greater responsibilities for our common endeavors.</item>
                            <item>—Our enmities are not immutable, and we must be prepared
                                realistically to recognize and deal with their cause.</item>
                            <item>—This requires mutual self-restraint and a willingness to
                                accommodate conflicting national interests through negotiation
                                rather than confrontation.</item>
                            <item>—Agreements are not, however, an end in themselves. They have
                                permanent significance only when they contribute to a stable
                                structure of peace which all countries wish to preserve because all
                                countries share its benefits.</item>
                            <item>—The unprecedented advances in science and technology have created
                                a new dimension of international life. The global community faces a
                                series of urgent problems and opportunities which transcend all
                                geographic and ideological borders. It is the distinguishing
                                characteristic of these issues that their solution requires
                                international cooperation on the broadest scale.</item>
                            <item>—We must, therefore, be willing to work with all
                                countries—adversaries as well as friends—toward a structure of peace
                                to which all nations contribute and in which all nations have a
                                stake.</item>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the remainder of Part I, discussing accomplishments,
                        disappointments, and goals, and Parts II-VII.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">PART VIII: CONCLUSION</p>
                    <p>I have stated many times that we seek a generation of peace. That is the goal
                        of this Administration, and it is against that standard that the initiatives
                        of 1971 should be judged.</p>
                    <p>In the last analysis, only the future will tell whether or not the
                        developments of the past year have truly brought us closer to that goal. All
                        we can say with certainty now is that a generation of peace is a more <pb
                            n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0378"/>credible goal at the end of 1971
                        than it appeared to be at its beginning. It may still appear to be distant.
                        It does not, however, still appear fanciful and utopian.</p>
                    <p>That fact in itself is important. Both this country and the world need a
                        brighter vision than managing crises and aiming only at staving off the
                        ultimate conflagration. The influence which history and our own efforts have
                        given this Nation can—and must—be used for something more than an
                        organization of world affairs which aims merely at keeping international
                        animosities in some sort of tenuous, fragile and constantly endangered
                        balance. The containment of enmity is better than its release. But it is not
                        enough as a permanent goal.</p>
                    <p>For too long, American policy consisted of reacting to events. We had a sense
                        of mission, but rarely a clear definition of our purpose. We were drawn into
                        situations, responding tactically, without a clear perception of where we
                        would end up. When we were not forced by events, we seldom struck out along
                        new paths because we had no positive conception of where we wanted to
                        go.</p>
                    <p>Our times demand more. A durable peace is a set of conditions and requires a
                        conscious effort to create those conditions. Peace will not come about by
                        itself, with us passively looking on or striking moralistic poses. Nor will
                        it come about automatically with the ending of a war. How many wars in this
                        century have ended without bringing a lasting peace because statesmen failed
                        to shape a durable peace out of the conditions which emerged from the
                        conflict? This is why it makes a difference how we liquidate the vestiges of
                        an earlier era as we move into the new. The future of peace—in Asia, in the
                        Middle East, in Europe—depends in large measure upon the steadfastness and
                        purposefulness of American policy all around the world.</p>
                    <p>Today the United States is once again acting with assurance and purpose on
                        the world stage.</p>
                    <p>Vietnam no longer distracts our attention from the fundamental issues of
                        global diplomacy or diverts our energies from priorities at home.</p>
                    <p>Our dramatic departures of the past year—the fruits of our planning and
                        policies over three years—reflect the historical conditions we see today and
                        the historic possibilities we see for tomorrow. They were momentous steps,
                        accelerating the very process of change which they addressed. The world—and
                        we ourselves—are still in the process of adjusting to the developments we
                        have set in train. But we know where we are going. We are moving with
                        history, and moving history ourselves.</p>
                    <p>There will always be conflict in the world, and turbulent change and
                        international rivalries. But we can seek a new structure of global <pb
                            n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0379"/>relationships in which all nations,
                        friend and adversary, participate and have a stake. We can seek to build
                        this into a world in which all nations, great and small, can live without
                        fear that their security and survival are in danger, and without fear that
                        every conflict contains for them the potential for Armageddon. In such a
                        structure of peace, habits of moderation and compromise can be nurtured, and
                        peoples and nations will find their fullest opportunities for social
                        progress, justice, and freedom.</p>
                    <p>This is what we mean by a generation of peace.</p>

                    <p>Three days before his trip to the People's Republic of China, on February 14,
                        1972, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> spoke about his
                        trip with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> in the Oval
                        Office following a meeting with André Malraux, former Minister of Culture of
                        France. (A memorandum of the conversation with Malraux is in the National
                        Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential
                        Materials, White House Special Files, President's Office Files, Memoranda
                        for the President.) During the President's conversation with <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, which was recorded on tape,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> briefly compared the
                        Chinese and Russians from a national perspective:</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now, you have a tendency,
                        if I may say so, Mr. President, to lump them [the Chinese] and the Russians;
                        they're a different phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Oh, I know.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They're just as dangerous,
                        in fact they're more dangerous over an historical period. But the Russians
                        don't think they're lovable, and the Russians don't think they have inward
                        security. The Russians are physical and they want to dominate physically.
                        And what they can't dominate, they don't really know how to handle. The
                        Chinese are much surer of themselves because they've been a great power all
                        their history. And, being Confucians, they really believe that virtue is
                        power.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then discussed how he saw
                        the role of the United States with respect to the Soviet Union and China:
                        “For the next 15 years we have to lean toward the Chinese against the
                        Russians. We have to play this balance of power game totally unemotionally.
                        Right now, we need the Chinese to correct the Russians, and to discipline
                        the Russians.”</p>
                    <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0380"/>
                    <p>Shortly thereafter, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                        continued in this vein:</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our concern with China
                        right now, in my view Mr. President, is to use it as a counterweight to
                        Russia, not for its local policy.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As a conduit, to keep it
                        in play on the subcontinent for the time being, but above all as a
                        counterweight to Russia. The fact that it doesn't have a global policy is an
                        asset to us, the fact that it doesn't have global strength yet—and to
                        prevent Russia from gobbling it up. If Russia dominates China, that would be
                        a fact of such tremendous significance.” (Conversation Between President

                        1972, at the beginning of his visit to China. The meeting took place at the
                        Chairman's residence. In a one-hour discussion that touched broadly on
                        U.S.-China bilateral relations, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        spoke of the future: “Because only if we see the whole picture of the world
                        and the great forces that move the world will we be able to make the right
                        decisions about the immediate and urgent problems that always completely
                        dominate our vision.” (Memorandum of conversation, February 21, 1972;

                    <p>Later in the discussion, the President shared his view of the relative
                        position of the United States and China with respect to each other within
                        the international community:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. Chairman, I am aware of the fact that over a period of years my position
                        with regard to the People's Republic was one that the Chairman and Prime
                        Minister totally disagreed with. What brings us together is a recognition of
                        a new situation in the world and a recognition <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361"
                            facs="0381"/>on our part that what is important is not a nation's
                        internal political philosophy. What is important is its policy toward the
                        rest of the world and toward us. That is why—this point I think can be said
                        to be honest—we have differences. The Prime Minister and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> discussed these differences.</p>
                    <p>“It also should be said—looking at the two great powers, the United States
                        and China—we know China doesn't threaten the territory of the United States;
                        I think you know the United States has no territorial designs on China. We
                        know China doesn't want to dominate the United States. We believe you too
                        realize the United States doesn't want to dominate the world. Also—maybe you
                        don't believe this, but I do—neither China nor the United States, both great
                        nations, want to dominate the world. Because our attitudes are the same on
                        these two issues, we don't threaten each other's territories.</p>
                    <p>“Therefore, we can find common ground, despite our differences, to build a
                        world structure in which both can be safe to develop in our own ways on our
                        own roads. That cannot be said about some other nations in the world.”</p>
                    <p>In his concluding comment, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        attempted to establish a positive atmosphere for the talks:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. Chairman, we know you and the Prime Minister have taken great risks in
                        inviting us here. For us also it was a difficult decision. But having read
                        some of the Chairman's statements, I know he is one who sees when an
                        opportunity comes, that you must seize the hour and seize the day.</p>
                    <p>“I would also like to say in a personal sense—and this to you Mr. Prime
                        Minister—you do not know me. Since you do not know me, you shouldn't trust
                        me. You will find I never say something I cannot do. And I always will do
                        more than I can say. On this basis I want to have frank talks with the
                        Chairman and, of course, with the Prime Minister.”</p>
                    <p>The following afternoon, in an extended meeting with Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> discussed at length his view of U.S.-China relations
                        within the context of the world stage:</p>
                    <p>“Now, I come to a point where I find I am in disagreement with the Prime
                        Minister's analysis of what America's role in the world should be. Let me
                        say that in terms of pure ideology, if I were in the Prime Minister's
                        position, as one who deeply believed in the socialist revolution, I would
                        take the same position he took with regard to the United States in his talks
                        with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. And publicly I
                        think that the Prime Minister and Chairman Mao have to take that position,
                        that is, the U.S. is a great capitalist imperialist power reaching out its
                        hands and it should go home from Asia, home from Europe, and let the
                        democratic forces and liberation forces develop in their own way.</p>
                    <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0382"/>
                    <p>“There are some of my advisers who tell me I could win the next election in a
                        landslide if I advocated such a policy, because the American people did not
                        seek this position of a world power and they would like to be relieved of
                        maintaining forces in Europe and the burden of maintaining guarantees to
                        various other nations in the world. And some would say why not cut the
                        American defense budget from $80 billion to $40 billion and then we could
                        use the money for domestic purposes to help the poor, rebuild the cities,
                        and all that sort of thing.</p>
                    <p>“I have resisted that—it is what we call the new isolationism for the
                        U.S.—and have barely been able to get a majority on some key votes. I am in
                        an ironic position because I am not a militarist. I don't want the U.S. to
                        be engaged in conquest around the world, but because as I analyze the
                        situation around the world I see we would be in great danger if we didn't
                        maintain certain levels of defense, I have had to come down hard for those
                        levels of defense.</p>
                    <p>“Now let me come to the point. I believe the interests of China as well as
                        the interests of the U.S. urgently require that the U.S. maintains its
                        military establishment at approximately its present levels and that the
                        U.S., with certain exceptions which we can discuss later, should maintain a
                        military presence in Europe, in Japan, and of course our naval forces in the
                        Pacific. I believe the interests of China are just as great as those of the
                        U.S. on that point.</p>
                    <p>“Let me make now what I trust will not be taken as an invidious comparison.
                        By religion I am a Quaker, although not a very good one, and I believe in
                        peace. All of my instincts are against a big military establishment and also
                        against military adventures. As I indicated a moment ago, the Prime Minister
                        is one of the world's leading spokesman for his philosophy and has to be
                        opposed to powers such as the U.S. maintaining huge military establishments.
                        But each of us had to put the survival of his nation first, and if the U.S.
                        were to reduce its military strength, and if the U.S. were to withdraw from
                        the areas I have described in the world, the dangers to the U.S. would be
                        great—and the dangers to China would be greater.</p>
                    <p>“I do not impute any motives of the present leaders of the Soviet Union. I
                        have to respect what they say, but I must make policy on the basis of what
                        they do. And in terms of the nuclear power balance, the Soviet Union has
                        been moving ahead at a very alarming rate over the past four years. I have
                        determined that the U.S. must not fall behind, or our shield of protection
                        for Europe, or for some of the nations of the Pacific with which we have
                        treaties, would be worthless.</p>
                    <p>“Then, as I look at the situation with respect to China, as we mentioned
                        yesterday, the Soviet Union has more forces on the Sino-Soviet borders than
                        it has arrayed against the Western Alliance. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of
                                <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0383"/>source text not
                            declassified</hi>] I suggest that if the Prime Minister could designate,
                        in addition to people on the civilian side, someone such as the Vice
                        Chairman for Military Affairs, (note: Yeh Chien-ying, Vice Chairman of the
                        Military Affairs Mission of the CCP) I believe it would be extremely
                        interesting for him. The meeting place should be highly secret, however, if
                        this could be arranged.</p>
                    <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have.</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: O.K.</p>
                    <p>“Now as I see China, and as I look at China's neighbors, this is what would
                        concern me. I believe Chairman <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1">Mao</persName>
                        and the Prime Minister when they say that China does not seek to reach out
                        its hands, and that while it will support forces of liberation, it does not
                        seek territory around the world. However, turning to what others may do, and
                        looking to the south, as far as India is concerned, China could probably
                        handle India in a month in the event they went to war. India is no threat to
                        China, but India supported by the Soviet Union is a very present threat to
                        China because China's ability to move, to deal with respect to India and to
                        take military action would be seriously in question if the Soviet Union, its
                        northern neighbor, was supporting India.</p>
                    <p>“That was why in the recent crisis that was one of the reasons we felt it was
                        very important to call the hand of India in moving against West Pakistan—and
                        we had conclusive evidence that the Prime Minister of India was embarked on
                        such a course—why we had to call their hand and prevent that from happening.
                        In other words, when we took a hard line against India and for Pakistan, we
                        were speaking not just to India or Pakistan but also—and we made them well
                        aware of it—to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“That brings us back again, to my major premise: if the U.S. were in a
                        position of weakness vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, whatever policy the U.S.
                        followed would have much less credence with the Soviet Union. For the U.S.
                        to be able to inhibit the Soviets in areas like the subcontinent, the U.S.
                        must at least be in a position of equality with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“We took a lot of heat on this policy because, again, we had a unholy
                        alliance against us (<persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>
                        laughs)—the pro-Soviet group, and the pro-India group which has an enormous
                        propaganda organization in the U.S., and also what you could call the
                        anti-Pakistan group because they didn't like the form of government in
                        Pakistan. They charged we were sacrificing India, the second biggest country
                        in the world, because of our desire to go forward with the China initiative.
                        That's to a certain extent true, because I believe Mr. Prime Minister, it is
                        very important that our policies—and this is one area I think we can
                        agree—that our policies in the subcontinent go together. I do not mean <pb
                            n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0384"/>in collusion, but I mean we don't
                        want to make movement with respect to India and Pakistan unless you are
                        fully informed, because we believe your interest here is greater than ours.
                        We face a problem here because the question of resuming aid to India,
                        economic aid, will soon arise when I return. A case can be made against this
                        on the grounds that they will be able to release funds from buying arms from
                        the Soviet Union which can then be manufactured in India.</p>
                    <p>“But a very critical question which we have to ask ourselves, the Prime
                        Minister and I, is would it be better for the U.S. to have some relation
                        with India, some influence in India or should we leave the field for the
                        Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>“Let me use one other example to bear out my argument that a U.S. presence in
                        Asia is in the interest of not just the U.S. but in the interest of China. I
                        think that the Prime Minister in terms of his philosophy has taken exactly
                        the correct position with respect to Japan, for example the U.S. should
                        withdraw its troops, the Treaty between Japan and the U.S. should be
                        abrogated, and Japan should be left to become a neutral country that is
                        unarmed. I think that the Prime Minister has to continue to say that. But I
                        want him to understand why I think strongly that our policy with respect to
                        Japan is in the security interest of his country even though it is opposed
                        to the philosophic doctrine which he espouses.</p>
                    <p>“The U.S. can get out of Japanese waters, but others will fish there. And
                        both China and the U.S. have had very difficult experiences with Japanese
                        militarism. We hope that the situation is changed permanently away from the
                        militarism that has characterized Japanese government in the past. On the
                        other hand, we cannot guarantee it and consequently we feel that if the U.S.
                        were to leave Japan naked, one of two things would happen, both of them bad
                        for China. The Japanese, with their enormously productive economy, their
                        great natural drive and their memories of the war they lost, could well turn
                        toward building their own defenses in the event that the U.S. guarantee were
                        removed. That's why I say that where Taiwan is concerned, and I would add
                        where Korea is concerned, the U.S. policy is opposed to Japan moving in as
                        the U.S. moves out, but we cannot guarantee that. And if we had no defense
                        arrangement with Japan, we would have no influence where that is
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>“On the other hand, Japan has the option of moving toward China and it also
                        has the option of moving toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“So the point I would summarize on is this. I can say, and I think the Prime
                        Minister will believe me, that the U.S. has no designs on China, that the
                        U.S. will use its influence with Japan and those other countries where we
                        have a defense relationship or provide economic <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365"
                            facs="0385"/>assistance, to discourage policies which would be
                        detrimental to China. But if the U.S. is gone from Asia, gone from Japan,
                        our protests, no matter how loud, would be like—to use the Prime Minister's
                        phrase—firing an empty cannon; we would have no rallying effect because
                        fifteen thousand miles away is just too far to be heard.</p>
                    <p>“Now I realize that I have painted here a picture which makes me sound like
                        an old cold warrior (Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1"
                            >Chou</persName> laughs). But it is the world as I see it, and when we
                        analyze it, it is what brings us, China and America, together; not in terms
                        of philosophy, not in terms of friendship—although I believe that is
                        important—but because of national security I believe our interests are in
                        common in the respects I have mentioned.</p>
                    <p>“I will just close by saying that after this analysis I would not want to
                        leave the impression that the U.S. is not going to try to go to the source
                        of the trouble, the Soviet Union, and try to make any agreements that will
                        reduce the common danger. Our policy will be completely open and frank with
                        China. Since Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit,
                        we have informed his (Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1"
                            >Chou</persName>'s) government completely with respect to the contacts
                        we have had with the Soviets. When we have had my meeting in Moscow, if the
                        Prime Minister agrees, I would like to have Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> come and report personally to the Prime Minister
                        on what we have discussed and what agreements we reached in Moscow. We are
                        going to try, for example, to get an arms limitation agreement and also make
                        progress on the Middle East if that subject is still before us.</p>
                    <p>“But the most important fact to bear in mind is that as far as China and the
                        U.S. are concerned, if the U.S. were to follow a course of weakening its
                        defense, of withdrawing totally or almost exclusively into the U.S., the
                        world would be much more dangerous in my view. The U.S. has no aggressive
                        intent against any other country; we have made our mistakes in the past. And
                        I do not charge that the Soviet Union has any aggressive interests against
                        any other country in the world, but in terms of the safety of these nations
                        which are not superpowers in the world, they will be much safer if there are
                        two superpowers, rather than just one.” (Memorandum of conversation,
                        February 22, 1972; ibid., Box 87, February 20, 1972)</p>
                    <p>The President returned to a discussion of his broader world view in a meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> the following
                        afternoon: “I believe it is very useful to think in philosophical terms. Too
                        often we look at problems of the world from the point of view of tactics.”
                        He continued: “It is essential to look at the world not just in terms of
                        immediate diplomatic battles and decisions but the great forces that move
                        the world. Maybe we have some disagreements, but we know there will be
                        changes, and we <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0386"/>know that there can
                        be a better, and I trust safer, world for our two peoples regardless of
                        differences if we can find common ground. As the Prime Minister and I both
                        have emphasized in our public toasts and in our private meetings, the world
                        can be a better and more peaceful place.” (Memorandum of conversation,

                    <p>During the course of a long meeting between President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Premier <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> on February 23, 1972, the
                        President raised the issue of a triangular relationship among the United
                        States, China, and the Soviet Union for the purpose of assuring the Prime
                        Minister that the United States did not intend to promote discord between
                        China and the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>“I am sure the Prime Minister, who follows our press very closely has noted
                        that some rather cynical observers have implied that it would be in our
                        interests to have the two great socialist superpowers—the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is one, and China could be one—be in
                        conflict because this would make things safer for us. Some have written
                        this. The Prime Minister probably didn't notice this, but I was asked in one
                        of my press conferences a year ago about this, and I categorically said that
                        it was not in the interest of the United States to have war between the
                        Soviet Union and China. War between major powers can never be contained, and
                        the whole world would become involved.</p>
                    <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Because
                        everything is linked.</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Now to the assurance
                        that I give the Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>“Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName>: Yes, I also
                        read your press conference.</p>
                    <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: To the assurances I
                        already gave the Prime Minister I add this. In December, when the situation
                        was getting very sensitive in the subcontinent—I'm using understatement—I
                        was prepared to warn the Soviet Union against undertaking an attack on
                        China. A warning, of course, means nothing unless the individual being
                        warned realizes you may have the will to carry it out. Insofar as Japan is
                        concerned and India, there is no question about where our influence will be
                        used. With regard to the Soviet Union, I can also give assurances <pb
                            n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0387"/>that the U.S. would oppose any
                        attempt by the Soviet Union to engage in an aggressive action against China.
                        This we would do because we believe it is in our interest, and in the
                        interest of preserving peace as well, world peace.” (Memorandum of

                    <p>The President raised the subject again in a meeting with <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou En-lai</persName> on February 25, speaking of
                        the Soviet Union:</p>
                    <p>“I think they apparently welcomed an antagonistic relationship between the
                        United States and the People's Republic of China. That is why they reacted
                        when we showed we had changed our attitude. They did not want us to have
                        more normal relations.</p>
                    <p>“I would not try to judge motives, but based on their conduct they apparently
                        want the People's Republic and the United States to be at odds. However, our
                        policy is not, as I said to the Prime Minister, to have the People's
                        Republic and the Soviet Union at odds. As I told the Prime Minister, I
                        reject the proposition that it is in the interest of the United States to
                        have the Soviet Union and China in a state of belligerency.</p>
                    <p>“In a sentence, we want good relations with the People's Republic and we want
                        good relations with the Soviet Union. And we would welcome better relations
                        between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. That, however,
                        is something the Soviet Union and the People's Republic will have to work
                        out.</p>
                    <p>“As I said when I was in Romania and Yugoslavia, my principle is any nation
                        can be a friend of the United States without being someone else's enemy.
                        That is my view.</p>
                    <p>“I realize that is sometimes very difficult to achieve, because there is a
                        tendency for some nations to gang up against other nations. But in the very
                        delicate power balances in the world we in the United States would not gain
                        in the long run by trying to stir up trouble between other nations. We, the
                        United States, would not gain by trying to stimulate conflict between the
                        Soviet Union and the People's Republic. The People's Republic would not
                        gain, the Soviet Union would not gain, and we would not gain by trying to
                        stimulate conflict between the others.</p>
                    <p>“That is the idea, but in practicality we realize that the real world is very
                        different than the ideal, and that is what we are concerned about, the real
                        world.” (Memorandum of conversation, February 25, 1972; ibid.)</p>

                    <p>On February 29, 1972, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                        met with the bipartisan Congressional leadership in the Cabinet Room of the
                        White House to discuss his trip to China. During the course of his comments,
                        which were summarized in a memorandum for the President's file prepared by
                        Tom C. Korologos of the White House Staff, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName> considered the possible long-term results of the
                        unprecedented visit:</p>
                    <p>“He then turned to long-term results which he classed as most important. He
                        said that he hopes that we will conduct our policy in Asia without threat or
                        use of force, and he hoped the Chinese would do the same. He said neither
                        the United States or China seek to dominate Asia, and both oppose the other
                        nation's domination in the future. He said that we shall speak of a common
                        interest and normalization of relations.</p>
                    <p>“He touched upon a ‘naive’ reporter's analysis that what finally got us
                        together was that both the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the
                        United States had found that their philosophies were not that far apart. The
                        President said that this was not at all true. All we are trying to do is get
                        to know each other better, and now I know them and they know us. We wanted
                        to help eliminate the inevitable road of suspicion over the past 25 years.
                        He said this road is the one which may lead to war.</p>
                    <p>“The President pointed out that had this meeting occurred 25 years ago, Korea
                        might have been avoided. He said neither side changed its beliefs. ‘They are
                        dedicated Communists and I am a dedicated American.’</p>
                    <p>“The simple thing that brought us together was a common interest, the
                        President said. We want to maintain our integrity and independence as they
                        do, and we both want to build a structure of peace in the Pacific and in the
                        World. If we do not find a way, we will be on a collision course.</p>
                    <p>“The President pointed to two more or less guidelines for the future. First,
                        they are the first to say that they are not a super power. Inevitably,
                        however, the President pointed out 750 million Chinese Communists are
                        something to be reckoned with. Consequently, they are destined to become a
                        major force.</p>
                    <p>“Second, the President said the relationship between the United States and
                        China is a very delicate one. The President then quoted Ayub Khan, who said
                        that relationships between nations are based on trust, no matter what their
                        beliefs are. He said that Khan said trust is a very thin thread. If it is
                        broken, it is important to put it back together. We have started to put it
                        back together. We are reliable, we are strong and we will continue to build
                        for the future.</p>
                    <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0389"/>
                    <p>“Our part is much greater than theirs. They read everything said in the
                        Senate and House and they read the newspaper editorials and columns. They
                        think that whenever a columnist speaks that that is the United States
                        speaking, the President said.</p>
                    <p>“While we have made a beginning in certain areas, we are far apart in other
                        areas, such as in Africa, the Middle East, etc., the President said.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that in the future, we must expect the Chinese at the
                        United Nations to express their views vociferously, but not to worry about
                        it. It would not mean our relationship is ended when they blast us.</p>
                    <p>“We must assume they are still as dedicated to their philosophies as we are
                        to ours. The President said, ‘I am glad I went. I am impressed with what I
                        saw and I am glad to be home. I have a new realization for us not to become
                        one of them, and to realize that when you get people as dedicated as they
                        are, that a soft and flabby or weak United States will not long survive in
                        the world. We need certain dedication and belief in our country. So, we must
                        continue our debates, but we must recognize that we must not lose
                        dedication, determination or our love of country.’</p>
                    <p>“He said that if the United States would withdraw and live as an island, then
                        others who may want to dominate the world would have a free hand to do so.
                        Consequently, we need to keep America strong with strong commitments around
                        the world. The most important thing to remember is that they constantly are
                        reinvigorating their people and we must reinspire our people.” (Memorandum

                    <p>On March 30, 1972, North Vietnam initiated a major offensive against the
                        South. The offensive was supplied in large measure by the Soviet Union,
                        which continued to be the principal support for Hanoi. <pb n="370"

                        long-standing concept of linkage, where progress with the Soviet Union in

                        Soviet Summit becomes more and more a possibility.” The conversation
                        continued:</p>
                    <p>“K: I am afraid so. I do not have another view. I do not think we can survive
                        a Soviet Summit as a country if we are humiliated in Vietnam. Unless they
                        accept rules of conduct, we may have to confront them. It is easy for me to
                        say. But if one looks at an election on that platform …</p>
                    <p>“P: The country would be done then.</p>
                    <p>“K: I think our bargaining position in Moscow, if it came out of a position
                        of total weakness, would be hopeless.</p>
                    <p>“P: I have been arguing for sending more carriers, planes, etc. and taking
                        the heat on it because I realize everything rides on this. If we lose this
                        one, the other stuff won't hold up. Our great China initiative—we at least
                        opened the door, and handle ourselves as gracefully as we can—and quietly
                        leave the scene.”</p>
                    <p>The President declared that “We have to look closely at our whole American
                        purpose as to whether or not it is possible for one [<hi rend="italic"
                            >sic</hi>] [non-Communist]country to defend itself and leave. We know it
                        is possible for a Communist country to do that. I am not sure. We shall
                        see.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> ordered <persName

                        thinking. “Tell him the Summit is on the line now,” the President said. “I
                        think he has to know with this going on as it is that we are under enormous
                        pressure. The whole Summit is being jeopardized. Our hole card is to play

                    <p>After brief discussion, the President concluded: “We both agree to go ahead
                        under those circumstances…. In the meantime, we will keep kicking them in
                        the balls. I made a decision no Summit if this thing goes. We have no other
                        choices now. We can't be put in a position of letting our whole policy be
                        hostage to a couple of summits.” (Transcript of telephone conversation

                            and 24, 1972, ostensibly to discuss the situation in Vietnam, as well as
                            many other bilateral and international issues, in preparation for the

                    </p>
                    <p>I am dictating this message personally to you rather than transmitting
                        through <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> so that you can
                        directly sense my views with regard to the state of play in your historic
                        journey.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, there is no question whatever among any of us here about the
                            skill, resourcefulness and determination you have displayed in
                            conducting your talks to date. I have read each one of your messages
                            carefully and have been enormously impressed with how you have had
                            exactly the right combination of sweet and sour in dealing with
                            them.</item>
                        <item>Second, as <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> has already
                            indicated, I have no objection to your staying until 1500 Moscow time or
                            even until 1700 or 1800 Moscow time, provided that you determine that
                            your staying on may make some contribution on Vietnam. It is important
                            for you to arrive at Camp <persName>David</persName> before midnight on
                                Monday<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">April 24.</note> so that we can
                            go back to Washington and thereby maintain our cover and have time to
                            prepare the announcement for Tuesday noon and Tuesday evening, as well
                            as getting your recommendations with regard to what I should say on
                            Wednesday or Thursday. As I am sure it has occurred to you, your hosts
                            have already gained one of their goals—that of having you stay longer in
                            Moscow on your first visit than you stayed in Peking. Of course, this is
                            of very little concern to us and a few more hours makes no difference on
                            that score.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It was predictable that they would give no ground on Vietnam although it
                        seems to me that their primary purpose of getting you to Moscow to discuss
                        the Summit has now been served while our purpose of getting some progress on
                        Vietnam has not been served, except, of course, in the very important,
                        intangible ways you have pointed out—<pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0392"
                        />the effect on Hanoi of Moscow receiving you three days after we bombed
                        Hanoi-Haiphong, of course, the obvious result of keeping Peking balanced
                        vis-à-vis Moscow.</p>
                    <p>As far as what they have agreed to—sending messages to Hanoi, I suppose that
                        in the long run this might have some beneficial effect. At least it enlists
                        them in the diplomatic game in a way that they have refused to become
                        enlisted before. However, we cannot be oblivious to the fact that while they
                        have agreed to send messages, secretly, they will be continuing to send
                        arms, publicly, and the latter fact will be the one our critics at home on
                        both the left and the right will eventually seize upon.</p>
                    <p>Whether your hosts were in collusion with Hanoi is, of course, a question
                        none of us can answer without knowing their innermost thoughts. But as far
                        as the observers who will be trying to appraise the success or failure of
                        your trip and later the Summit, if it comes off, there is one hard fact that
                        stands out—anyone who gives a murder weapon to someone he knows is going to
                        kill with it is equally responsible for the crime. You and I might have
                        reason to believe that both Peking and Moscow would like to de-fuse the
                        situation in Southeast Asia but cannot do so for reasons of which we are
                        aware. On the other hand, in dealing with our own opinion at home, this
                        sophisticated analysis makes no dent whatever.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are comments on domestic issues.]</p>
                    <p>After the first shock of the announcement of your trip wears off—by the end
                        of the week a chorus will arise from both the doves and the hawks raising
                        two questions: First, what did <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> discuss with the Russians? (and here there will be
                        insistence that you inform the Foreign Relations Committee and all others on
                        this score) and (2) what did the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> trip accomplish in terms of getting progress on
                        Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>You and I know that it has to have accomplished a considerable amount
                        indirectly by the message it sends to Hanoi and also that it may open the
                        door for future progress on Vietnam where the Soviet Union may play a more
                        helpful role. On the other hand, we must batten down the hatches for what
                        will be a rising chorus of criticism from our political opponents on the
                        left and from our hawk friends on the right for going to Moscow and failing
                        to get progress on the major issue.</p>
                    <p>I have deliberately painted this picture at its worst because, of course, we
                        must prepare for the worst and hope for the best. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> makes the point, and I share it to an
                        extent, that Hanoi will be under enormous heat to be more forthcoming in
                        their private meeting with you on May 2nd. On the other hand, they may hold
                        firm. It is then that we will have to make the really tough decision. It is
                        my view that if they give no more than they have given on the twelve
                        previous meetings they have had with you—and I believe those meetings were
                        constructive <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0393"/>of course but not on
                        the decisive issue—then we will have to go all-out on the bombing front.</p>
                    <p>That is why it is vitally important that your hosts know that all
                        options—repeat—all options as far as actions against the North are open in
                        the event that the meeting of May 2 turns out to be as non-productive on the
                        really critical issues as have the previous meetings you have had with the
                        North Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>Going back to our major goals, I could not agree with you more that the
                        Summit in terms of long-term interests of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss> is vitally important. However, no matter how good a deal we
                        get out of the Summit on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> and on the
                        other issues, we must realize that now the Soviet Summit, far more than the
                        Chinese Summit, due to the fact that your trip directly dealt with Vietnam,
                        will be judged as a success or failure depending upon whether we get some
                        progress on Vietnam. My feeling about the necessity for resuming attacks on
                        the Hanoi-Haiphong complex in the event that the May 2 meeting is a dud is
                        as you can recognize quite different from the decision I made with regard to
                        activities we would undertake prior to, during and after the China visit.
                        For four weeks before we went to China, for the two weeks that we were there
                        or on the way and for three weeks after we were there we made a decision,
                        which I think was right, not to be provocative in our bombing of targets
                        north of the DMZ even though we knew from all intelligence reports that an
                        enemy build-up was going forward. I think that decision was right at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>However, I am convinced that we cannot pay that kind of price for the Soviet
                        Summit—much as I recognize substantively that the Soviet Summit is of course
                        going to be infinitely more productive than the Chinese Summit.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are brief comments, mainly concerning <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss>.]</p>
                    <p>We have painted ourselves into this corner—quite deliberately—and I only hope
                        that developments will justify the course we have followed.</p>
                    <p>In sum, we risked the Summit by hitting Hanoi and Haiphong. After we have
                        gone through your meeting of May 2, we may be faced with the hard decision
                        to risk it again and probably damage it irreparably because we may have no
                        other choice if that meeting turns out to be a failure.</p>
                    <p>I cannot emphasize too strongly that except for a few sophisticated foreign
                        policy observers, interest in what we are able to get on a <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreement, trade, a better communiqué
                        than the French got, etc., will not save the Summit unless one way or
                        another we are able to point to some progress on Vietnam. Of course, I am
                        aware of the fact that if your hosts still want to go forward with the
                        Summit, despite the actions we <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0394"/>may
                        have had to take after May 2, we will do so because we know that the
                        substantive agreements that we will reach at the Summit are in and of
                        themselves substantively very important even without progress on Vietnam.
                        What I am trying to emphasize is that we must face the hard fact that we
                        have now convinced the country that Soviet arms and Soviet tanks have fueled
                        this massive invasion of South Vietnam by the North. Having done so, it is
                        only logical that our critics on both right and left will hammer us hard if
                        we sit down and meet with the Soviets, drink toasts, sign communiqués, etc.,
                        without getting progress on Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>However it all comes out, just remember we all know we couldn't have a better
                        man in Moscow at this time than <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>. Rebozo joins us in sending our regards.</p>

                    <p>We took over essentially a post-war foreign policy. Complete attitudes had to
                        be changed. We took office when the American pre-eminence to wage war had
                        begun to wane. Much of our policy was based on previous successes. The
                        principal problem was to adjust to the new realities.</p>
                    <p>When America adopted the post-war policies, the United States was the only
                        country capable of having a global foreign policy. We had a history of
                        uninterrupted success. We could invite challenge anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0395"/>
                    <p>Our task was how to define a role for the United States where we could have a
                        constructive and permanent relationship with other nations. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine gives other countries a
                        bigger role. Some call it a retreat. It has led to our now evolving
                        relationships with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It
                        is sometimes called the balance of power approach.</p>
                    <p>The first concern of any leader must be the basic security of the country. It
                        cannot base decisions on circumstances elsewhere. Each country wants
                        independent relations with the other nations. We have been lucky in the past
                        because of geographic considerations. Vast oceans lay between ourselves and
                        possible enemies. Technology has changed all this, requiring us now to
                        develop careful relationships with other countries. It is important that we
                        establish relationships with other countries even where painful to our
                        traditional friends, who are seeing us establish relationships with
                        previously rejected countries. We no longer have a black and white foreign
                        policy. All nations have a stake. We could not overlook the 800 million
                        people in the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>Our relations with China started in a curious way. The President asked us to
                        explore contacts. It is amazing how difficult it is to establish ties to a
                        nation after 22 years of an isolationist policy. It is difficult to find an
                        intermediary and even to do simple things like drafting messages acceptable
                        to both sides. It is an interesting analysis for a good student in foreign
                        relations. Once contact was established, problems arose because so many
                        nations were looking at our China policy. They were looking at specific
                        details and were concerned we might be shifting our weight.</p>
                    <p>The essence of our China policy is that we do not impinge on Chinese
                        interests very much. Our effort was basically in three levels. First was
                        what specific arrangement could be made in Shanghai. Second was to make
                        inroads bilaterally which, if acceptable, would prove significant. And third
                        was the impact of Americans on Chinese society, and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>In our discussions with the Chinese our vast cultural differences became
                        apparent. Where Americans are pragmatic, the Chinese concentrate on
                        principle. They want to distill things into absolute terms. We talk about
                        peace. The Chinese talk about justice and they are dedicated to the
                        proposition that without justice, peace is meaningless. We talk about
                        compromise. They talk about truth. It is interesting to observe what
                        happens. The Chinese have many of the rules my former students thought they
                        would like to have, but with the Chinese we are making no great deals. There
                        is no counter-Soviet strategy or shifting of weight from Tokyo to
                        Peking.</p>
                    <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0396"/>
                    <p>With Japan we have concrete problems. In China we are making a policy
                        framework, results of which will not be known for four to five years. Our
                        Japanese experience has been considerably different than the Chinese. After
                        the war, the Japanese concentrated on economic matters and left foreign
                        policy and security in American hands. This relationship could not continue.
                        Japan must play a more significant role without nationalism and without all
                        their weight with one major power.</p>
                    <p>Our objective in the Soviet summit is to try to create vested interests for
                        both parties in many areas so that when crises occur, there will be a group
                        within the Soviet Union with a vested interest want-ing a steady course
                        resulting in negotiation.</p>
                    <p>Now, about Southeast Asia. Our major concern is that a new international
                        order must be built. This is complicated by a disaster which has lasted ten
                        years. The debate is so strong that I cannot bridge the valley. The problem
                        we face is how to act in a situation where success for the opponent would
                        mean the capture of an additional 60,000 Americans. The only alternative
                        given us is to impose a Communist government on the South. This we refuse to
                        do. We will not join our enemies to defeat our friends. This is the only
                        obstacle. This is a very painful problem and painful decisions have to be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>I am not here to talk about Vietnam but Asian policy, but the discussion must
                        include Vietnam. After the elections, we will find we have had great
                        successes but also some regrets. We want to help other nations become
                        participants in world order. [applause]<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">Brackets

                    <p rend="flushleft">Good evening:</p>
                    <p>Five weeks ago, on Easter weekend, the Communist armies of North Vietnam
                        launched a massive invasion of South Vietnam, an invasion that was made
                        possible by tanks, artillery, and other advanced offensive weapons supplied
                        to Hanoi by the Soviet Union and other Communist nations.</p>
                    <p>The South Vietnamese have fought bravely to repel this brutal assault.
                        Casualties on both sides have been very high. Most tragically, there have
                        been over 20,000 civilian casualties, including women and children, in the
                        cities which the North Vietnamese have shelled in wanton disregard of human
                        life.</p>
                    <p>As I announced in my report to the Nation 12 days ago, the role of the United
                        States in resisting this invasion has been limited to air and naval strikes
                        on military targets in North and South Vietnam. As I also pointed out in
                        that report, we have responded to North Vietnam's massive military offensive
                        by undertaking wide-ranging new peace efforts aimed at ending the war
                        through negotiation.</p>
                    <p>On April 20, I sent Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to
                        Moscow for 4 days of meetings with General Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and other Soviet leaders. I
                        instructed him to emphasize our desire for a rapid solution to the war and
                        our willingness to look at all possible approaches. At that time, the Soviet
                        leaders showed an interest in bringing the war to an end on a basis just to
                        both sides. They urged resumption of negotiations in Paris, and they
                        indicated they would use their constructive influence.</p>
                    <p>I authorized Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to meet
                        privately with the top North Vietnamese negotiator, Le Duc Tho, on Tuesday,
                        May 2, in Paris. Ambassador Porter, as you know, resumed the public peace
                        negotiations in Paris on April 27 and again on May 4. At those meetings,
                        both public and private, all we heard from the enemy was bombastic rhetoric
                        and a replaying of their demands for surrender. For example, at the May 2
                        secret meeting, I authorized Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> to talk about every conceivable avenue toward
                        peace. The North Vietnamese flatly refused to consider any of these
                        approaches. They refused to offer any new <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                            facs="0398"/>approach of their own. Instead, they simply read verbatim
                        their previous public demands.</p>
                    <p>Here is what over 3 years of public and private negotiations with Hanoi has
                        come down to: The United States, with the full concurrence of our South
                        Vietnamese allies, has offered the maximum of what any President of the
                        United States could offer.</p>
                    <p>We have offered a deescalation of the fighting. We have offered a cease-fire
                        with a deadline for withdrawal of all American forces. We have offered new
                        elections which would be internationally supervised with the Communists
                        participating both in the supervisory body and in the elections
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>President Thieu has offered to resign one month before the elections. We have
                        offered an exchange of prisoners of war in a ratio of 10 North Vietnamese
                        prisoners for every one American prisoner that they release. And North
                        Vietnam has met each of these offers with insolence and insult. They have
                        flatly and arrogantly refused to negotiate an end to the war and bring
                        peace. Their answer to every peace offer we have made has been to escalate
                        the war.</p>
                    <p>In the 2 weeks alone since I offered to resume negotiations, Hanoi has
                        launched three new military offensives in South Vietnam. In those 2 weeks
                        the risk that a Communist government may be imposed on the 17 million people
                        of South Vietnam has increased, and the Communist offensive has now reached
                        the point that it gravely threatens the lives of 60,000 American troops who
                        are still in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>There are only two issues left for us in this war. First, in the face of a
                        massive invasion do we stand by, jeopardize the lives of 60,000 Americans,
                        and leave the South Vietnamese to a long night of terror? This will not
                        happen. We shall do whatever is required to safeguard American lives and
                        American honor.</p>
                    <p>Second, in the face of complete intransigence at the conference table do we
                        join with our enemy to install a Communist government in South Vietnam?
                        This, too, will not happen. We will not cross the line from generosity to
                        treachery.</p>
                    <p>We now have a clear, hard choice among three courses of action: Immediate
                        withdrawal of all American forces, continued attempts at negotiation, or
                        decisive military action to end the war.</p>
                    <p>I know that many Americans favor the first course of action, immediate
                        withdrawal. They believe the way to end the war is for the United States to
                        get out, and to remove the threat to our remaining forces by simply
                        withdrawing them.</p>
                    <p>From a political standpoint, this would be a very easy choice for me to
                        accept. After all, I did not send over one-half million Americans to
                        Vietnam. I have brought 500,000 men home from Vietnam since I took <pb
                            n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0399"/>office. But, abandoning our
                        commitment in Vietnam here and now would mean turning 17 million South
                        Vietnamese over to Communist tyranny and terror. It would mean leaving
                        hundreds of American prisoners in Communist hands with no bargaining
                        leverage to get them released.</p>
                    <p>An American defeat in Vietnam would encourage this kind of aggression all
                        over the world, aggression in which smaller nations armed by their major
                        allies, could be tempted to attack neighboring nations at will in the
                        Mideast, in Europe, and other areas. World peace would be in grave
                        jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>The second course of action is to keep on trying to negotiate a settlement.
                        Now this is the course we have preferred from the beginning and we shall
                        continue to pursue it. We want to negotiate, but we have made every
                        reasonable offer and tried every possible path for ending this war at the
                        conference table.</p>
                    <p>The problem is, as you all know, it takes two to negotiate and now, as
                        throughout the past 4 years, the North Vietnamese arrogantly refuse to
                        negotiate anything but an imposition, an ultimatum that the United States
                        impose a Communist regime on 17 million people in South Vietnam who do not
                        want a Communist government.</p>
                    <p>It is plain then that what appears to be a choice among three courses of
                        action for the United States is really no choice at all. The killing in this
                        tragic war must stop. By simply getting out, we would only worsen the
                        bloodshed. By relying solely on negotiations, we would give an intransigent
                        enemy the time he needs to press his aggression on the battlefield.</p>
                    <p>There is only one way to stop the killing. That is to keep the weapons of war
                        out of the hands of the international outlaws of North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the war in Vietnam, the United States has exercised a degree of
                        restraint unprecedented in the annals of war. That was our responsibility as
                        a great Nation, a Nation which is interested—and we can be proud of this as
                        Americans—as America has always been, in peace not conquest.</p>
                    <p>However, when the enemy abandons all restraint, throws its whole army into
                        battle in the territory of its neighbor, refuses to negotiate, we simply
                        face a new situation.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, with 60,000 Americans threatened, any President who
                        failed to act decisively would have betrayed the trust of his country and
                        frayed the cause of world peace.</p>
                    <p>I therefore concluded that Hanoi must be denied the weapons and supplies it
                        needs to continue the aggression. In full coordination with <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0400"/>the Republic of Vietnam, I have ordered the
                        following measures which are being implemented as I am speaking to you.</p>
                    <p>All entrances to North Vietnamese ports will be mined to prevent access to
                        these ports and North Vietnamese naval operations from these ports. United
                        States forces have been directed to take appropriate measures within the
                        internal and claimed territorial waters of North Vietnam to interdict the
                        delivery of any supplies. Rail and all other communications will be cut off
                        to the maximum extent possible. Air and naval strikes against military
                        targets in North Vietnam will continue.</p>
                    <p>These actions are not directed against any other nation. Countries with ships
                        presently in North Vietnamese ports have already been notified that their
                        ships will have three daylight periods to leave in safety. After that time,
                        the mines will become active and any ships attempting to leave or enter
                        these ports will do so at their own risk.</p>
                    <p>These actions I have ordered will cease when the following conditions are
                        met: <list>
                            <item>First, all American prisoners of war must be returned.</item>
                            <item>Second, there must be an internationally supervised cease-fire
                                throughout Indochina.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once prisoners of war are released, once the internationally supervised
                        cease-fire has begun, we will stop all acts of force throughout Indochina
                        and at that time we will proceed with a complete withdrawal of all American
                        forces from Vietnam within 4 months.</p>
                    <p>Now, these terms are generous terms. They are terms which would not require
                        surrender and humiliation on the part of anybody. They would permit the
                        United States to withdraw with honor. They would end the killing. They would
                        bring our <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>'s home. They would allow
                        negotiations on a political settlement between the Vietnamese themselves.
                        They would permit all the nations which have suffered in this long
                        war—Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, South Vietnam—to turn at last to the
                        urgent works of healing and of peace. They deserve immediate acceptance by
                        North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>It is appropriate to conclude my remarks tonight with some comments directed
                        individually to each of the major parties involved in the continuing tragedy
                        of the Vietnam war.</p>
                    <p>First, to the leaders of Hanoi, your people have already suffered too much in
                        your pursuit of conquest. Do not compound their agony with continued
                        arrogance; choose instead the path of a peace that redeems your sacrifices,
                        guarantees true independence for your country, and ushers in an era of
                        reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>To the people of South Vietnam, you shall continue to have our firm support
                        in your resistance against aggression. It is your spirit that will <pb
                            n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0401"/>determine the outcome of the
                        battle. It is your will that will shape the future of your country.</p>
                    <p>To other nations, especially those which are allied with North Vietnam, the
                        actions I have announced tonight are not directed against you. Their sole
                        purpose is to protect the lives of 60,000 Americans, who would be gravely
                        endangered in the event that the Communist offensive continues to roll
                        forward, and to prevent the imposition of a Communist government by brutal
                        aggression upon 17 million people.</p>
                    <p>I particularly direct my comments tonight to the Soviet Union. We respect the
                        Soviet Union as a great power. We recognize the right of the Soviet Union to
                        defend its interests when they are threatened. The Soviet Union in turn must
                        recognize our right to defend our interests.</p>
                    <p>No Soviet soldiers are threatened in Vietnam. Sixty thousand Americans are
                        threatened. We expect you to help your allies, and you cannot expect us to
                        do other than to continue to help our allies, but let us, and let all great
                        powers, help our allies only for the purpose of their defense, not for the
                        purpose of launching invasions against their neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise the cause of peace, the cause in which we both have so great a
                        stake, will be seriously jeopardized.</p>
                    <p>Our two nations have made significant progress in our negotiations in recent
                        months. We are near major agreements on nuclear arms limitation, on trade,
                        on a host of other issues.</p>
                    <p>Let us not slide back toward the dark shadows of a previous age. We do not
                        ask you to sacrifice your principles, or your friends, but neither should
                        you permit Hanoi's intransigence to blot out the prospects we together have
                        so patiently prepared.</p>
                    <p>We, the United States and the Soviet Union, are on the threshold of a new
                        relationship that can serve not only the interests of our two countries, but
                        the cause of world peace. We are prepared to continue to build this
                        relationship. The responsibility is yours if we fail to do so.</p>
                    <p>And finally, may I say to the American people, I ask you for the same strong
                        support you have always given your President in difficult moments. It is you
                        most of all that the world will be watching.</p>
                    <p>I know how much you want to end this war. I know how much you want to bring
                        our men home. And I think you know from all that I have said and done these
                        past 3-½ years how much I, too, want to end the war to bring our men
                        home.</p>
                    <p>You want peace. I want peace. But, you also want honor and not defeat. You
                        want a genuine peace, not a peace that is merely a prelude to another
                        war.</p>
                    <p>At this moment, we must stand together in purpose and resolve. As so often in
                        the past, we Americans did not choose to resort to war. It has <pb n="382"
                            xml:id="pg_382" facs="0402"/>been forced upon us by an enemy that has
                        shown utter contempt toward every overture we have made for peace. And that
                        is why, my fellow Americans, tonight I ask for your support of this
                        decision, a decision which has only one purpose, not to expand the war, not
                        to escalate the war, but to end this war and to win the kind of peace that
                        will last.</p>
                    <p>With God's help, with your support, we will accomplish that great goal.</p>
                    <p>Thank you and good night.</p>

                    <p>On May 8, 1972, immediately following the President's address on the
                        situation in South Vietnam (see <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>),
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> spoke to the Cabinet and
                        selected senior White House staff in the Cabinet Room. According to the
                        notes of the President's Assistant, <persName corresp="#p_PRKJ1">Raymond K.
                            Price, Jr.</persName>, the President discussed the possible risk to the
                        Moscow Summit that could result from his decision to mine Haiphong
                        harbor:</p>
                    <p>“'We're aware of the risks. We also must realize that an American President
                        couldn't be in Moscow when Soviet tanks were rumbling through the streets of
                        Hue—unless he could do something about it.'</p>
                    <p>“He added that we have put the proposition to the Soviets very directly: we
                        are prepared to go forward and negotiate on <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, etc., and even with the Summit—so the responsibility is
                        theirs as to whether it goes forward or is postponed.” (Memorandum for the

                        told a group of reporters at a news conference:</p>
                    <p>“For 2 years we have been engaged in negotiations on a broad range of issues
                        with the Soviet Union. We are on the verge not just of success in this or
                        that negotiation, but of what could be a new relationship of benefit to all
                        of mankind, a new relationship in which, on both sides, whenever there is a
                        danger of crisis, there will be enough people who have a commitment to
                        constructive programs so that they could exercise restraining influences.
                        But in order for such a policy to succeed, it cannot be accepted that one
                        country can be oblivious to the impact on <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"

                    <p>Let me talk to you a moment about summitry. I've expressed some very direct
                        views about this. Previous summits have generated a spirit of Vienna,
                        Geneva, Camp <persName>David</persName> and Glassboro, but we wound up with
                        flat beer as far as agreements were concerned. I wanted the summit prepared
                        not for cosmetics which raise great hopes, which are then dashed, but to
                        cover substance. This is why we have taken so much time to arrange this
                        meeting—to prepare for probable agreements in certain areas.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d114fn2">Shortly after this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> covered much the same ground in remarks to members
                            of the press at a White House reception for those accompanying the

                        it is probably difficult to find any meeting of powerful heads of state
                        where there has been more meticulous groundwork laid. We have discussed in
                        detail the key areas—commerce, space, <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>,

                        each other's vital security interests. It promises to be a very difficult
                        trip with many long and arduous meetings.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is brief commentary on logistics and on <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>Vietnam will be on the agenda and will be discussed, but it is best not to
                        speculate on this and put us or the Russians on the spot. Another quite
                        difficult area that we will discuss is the Middle East where we are very,
                        very far apart. Perhaps we can narrow the differences by the time we leave
                        so that each will know more accurately what the other's position is.</p>
                    <p>The fact that this summit is going forward has great significance. Both sides
                        are recognizing the fundamental principle that their own security interests
                        must take precedence over certain matters and issues which are peripheral
                        and collateral, Vietnam and the Middle East, for example. It is important to
                        find areas where we can cooperate. Neither side believes that just getting
                        to know one another better will change the actual conditions. There are some
                        very pragmatic considerations. Confrontation is not in their interest or in
                        ours. We must both avoid being dragged into major conflicts in outlying
                        areas where it is not to either side's interests. I look forward to hard
                        bargaining without propaganda. But let's not raise our hopes too high or too
                        low.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> to speak. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                            >Rogers</persName> said he wanted to underscore two points. The
                        preparation for this summit has been excellent and that a large number of
                        government departments and agencies have been involved. The Soviet attitude
                        thus far has been constructive and in preliminary talks the Soviets have
                        made some concessions. In the final analysis, however, nothing comes into
                        play because a lot of these agreements are interrelated.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected to say “linked” and that we have some reason to
                        believe that they will be linked successfully because no nation has ever
                        been better prepared for a meeting. The President then asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to speak.</p>
                    <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0405"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> opened by saying he had a
                        few general observations. The fact that the summit is going forward
                        underlines the point that if both sides did not believe there would be
                        progress possible at the session then it would have been canceled. There has
                        been an understanding, a recognition of the pressures on both of us. In
                        advance of the meeting, the President wanted precise, concrete negotiations.
                        On the Russian side the leadership has many pressures upon it. The leaders
                        understand the impact that a nuclear war could have on the Soviets. In
                        addition, they have a very complex economy which needs assistance and a
                        resulting pressure from the Soviet people. One comes away from all of this
                        with the belief that the Soviets have a stake in improving relations with
                        the United States. It is not inconceivable that the Soviet leadership is
                        interested in a period of détente for the purpose of softening up the United
                        States and then pushing us out of Europe. But whatever their motive, we
                        should not be afraid. Our strategy will be to create vested interests for
                        peace within the Soviet structure which would help encourage restraint on
                        their actions. In China, as a result of our visit, we set up a framework for
                        a new relationship. In Moscow, we hope to get concrete agreements which can
                        lead to mutual restraints on our policies. We also hope to nail down plans
                        for mutual cooperation in space and in other areas where we can work
                        together. We have an historic opportunity, but what will happen will depend
                        on what the President and the Secretary of State and others can
                        negotiate.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected to say that it is very important that we not
                        picture the meeting as an effort to set up a Soviet-United States
                        condominium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said, yes, this was so, or
                        to portray the meeting as one which is going forward at the expense of the
                        allies of both sides.</p>
                    <p>The President added, perhaps the greatest consideration that one should
                        recognize as this meeting is about to get underway is the fact that the
                        Soviets have now achieved nuclear parity. We have <gloss target="#t_MIRV1"
                            >MIRV</gloss>, but they have more missiles. If either President
                        Eisenhower or President <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> had
                        gone to Moscow they both would have gone in a position where they were
                        looking down the throat of the Soviets. But the situation has now
                        changed.</p>
                    <p>In this circumstance, the President said, you don't have to tote up who won
                        or who lost as a result of this meeting. You can be sure that I, Bill, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will make sure that the
                        United States' interests will be protected. But if the two super-powers meet
                        and then either one begins to say that I won and you lost, perhaps we will
                        have done more harm than good. The whole business is one of mutuality. The
                        Russians are extremely sensitive. They want to be accepted on an equal
                        basis. <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0406"/>They remember all too well
                        the strategic military situation during the Cuban missile crisis. We both
                        expect to bargain very hard, very tough. But when both sides realize they
                        have a mutual interest in keeping a deal, that's when it will mean
                        something.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and senior U.S.
                        officials visited the Soviet Union May 22-29, 1972, for Summit meetings.
                        During the first plenary session held in St. Catherine's Hall, Grand Kremlin
                        Palace on May 23, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> expounded on
                        détente:</p>
                    <p>“The President said he would like to think that each person at the table is a
                        sentimental man to a certain degree, but we are meeting here not because of
                        sentiment, but because we are pragmatic men. As practical and honest men we
                        recognize that our systems are different and that in many parts of the world
                        our interests conflict. But as practical men, we have learned the lessons of
                        history and will not allow ourselves to be dragged into conflict in areas
                        peripheral to our interests. These problems may seem important at the time,
                        but cannot compare in importance with the need to have good relations
                        between the two most powerful countries in the world.</p>
                    <p>“So we see that the time has come when our two nations have an opportunity
                        which perhaps has not come to nations in history up to this point. That time
                        means that we must find ways to work together to limit arms, to expand our
                        economic relations for our mutual benefit and also to work together in other
                        fields such as improvement of the environment, cooperation in outer space
                        and others. We would continue to compete, but it can be a friendly
                        competition in which each side would gain rather than lose, and we can both
                        work for the mutual good.</p>
                    <p>“This does not mean that settlement of differences will always be easy.
                        Differences are settled easily only under the dictation of the strong to the
                        weak. We had reached the stage in our relations—and the President believes
                        this was fortunate—where we consider ourselves to be equally strong.
                        Therefore, we feel this opportunity is one which is unique, not only because
                        of what we do here on these agreements <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387"
                            facs="0407"/>which are important in themselves, but even more so because
                        of the way we view the future.</p>
                    <p>“Good relations between the Soviet Union and the United States can have an
                        enormous effect for the good of the people of the whole world and above all
                        for the good of the people of our two countries. It is his hope that this
                        week the personal relationships between us will become better. We can begin
                        the process of exploring future progress which could make these agreements
                        seem small in terms of what can be accomplished in the future.</p>
                    <p>“The President said he wished to close his remarks by saying what his Soviet
                        friends may be too polite to say. He said his reputation is of being very
                        hard-line and cold-war oriented.</p>
                    <p>“<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> remarked that he had heard
                        this sometime back.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that he has a strong belief in our system but at the same
                        time he respects those who believe just as strongly in their system. There
                        must be room in this world for two great nations with different systems to
                        live together and work together. We cannot do this however, by mushy
                        sentimentality or by glossing over differences which exist. We can do it
                        only by working out real problems in a concrete fashion, determined to place
                        our common interests above our differences.” (Memorandum of conversation

                    <p>At the final plenary session, held at St. Catherine's Hall on May 29, the
                        President returned to the theme of détente:</p>
                    <p>“The President said he was grateful for the boundless hospitality of his
                        hosts, and, more important, that he was grateful for the frank talks. The
                        results were significant because of the preparatory work by the experts both
                        in Moscow and in the United States. We recognized at the outset that most
                        summit conferences had been failures; since the end of World War II they had
                        raised hopes and then failed. These meetings, on the other hand, had been
                        successful because they were well prepared, and also because—and this was
                        important but quite difficult to measure—because of an acceptance of mutual
                        responsibility to respect the other side's viewpoint, and its right to
                        disagree strongly, and, while respecting the equal strength of each side,
                        finally to find a way to reach agreement on fundamental matters.</p>
                    <p>“The President continued by noting that superficial observers, sometimes in
                        the press, would judge the meeting only by the agreements signed. These are
                        important, but as pointed out by the Soviet side the results will be
                        determined more by how the agreements are implemented. <pb n="388"
                            xml:id="pg_388" facs="0408"/>By establishing a process for progress in
                        all areas, this enabled us to reach agreement.</p>
                    <p>“The President said that on the part of the United States he could assure the
                        Soviet leaders that on all levels of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                        Government there would be an intention to take a forthcoming attitude in
                        working out problems that might arise. For example, there is the question of
                        trade. The President noted that he had pointed out the great possibilities
                        in this field. Even though we had not made the progress we would have liked,
                        our differences were narrowed and we could be confident that we would see a
                        blossoming of trade and a new relationship of enormous benefit to our
                        peoples. The key to this, as well as other difficult issues, will be the
                        continuation of frank contacts at all levels, including ambassadors and
                        ministers, and, of course, at the summit level where that is the best way to
                        break an impasse.</p>
                    <p>“The President said he wanted to conclude his remarks by saying that history
                        had been made by what had been signed, but the real test is what happens in
                        the future. Now that we all know and respect each other, we have an
                        opportunity to make even greater history for future generations.”

                                course. Nothing in this document entitles us to give up our
                                alliances or would justify lowering the efforts that have brought us
                                to this point; but at the same time, it is an event of considerable
                                significance that the countries whose seemingly irreconcilable
                                hostility has characterized the entire postwar period, and the two
                                countries which, between themselves or, indeed, individually have
                                the capacity to destroy humanity are making an effort which would
                                state some principles which would reduce the dangers of war and
                                which would enable them to promote a more stable international

                        American people. Everywhere new hopes are rising for a world no longer
                        shadowed by fear and want and war, and as Americans we can be proud that we
                        now have an historic opportunity to play a great role in helping to achieve
                        man's oldest dream—a world in which all nations can enjoy the blessings of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>On this journey we saw many memorable sights, but one picture will always
                        remain indelible in our memory—the flag of the United States of America
                        flying high in the spring breeze above Moscow's ancient Kremlin
                        fortress.</p>
                    <p>To millions of Americans for the past quarter century the Kremlin has stood
                        for implacable hostility toward all that we cherish, and to millions of
                        Russians the American flag has long been held up as a symbol of evil. No one
                        would have believed, even a short time ago, that these two apparently
                        irreconcilable symbols would be seen together as we saw them for those few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>But this does not mean that we bring back from Moscow the promise of instant
                        peace, but we do bring the beginning of a process that can lead to a lasting
                        peace. And that is why I have taken the extraordinary action of requesting
                        this special joint session of the Congress because we have before us an
                        extraordinary opportunity.</p>
                    <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0413"/>
                    <p>I have not come here this evening to make new announcements in a dramatic
                        setting. This summit has already made its news. It has barely begun,
                        however, to make its mark on our world, and I ask you to join me
                        tonight—while events are fresh, while the iron is hot—in starting to
                        consider how we can help to make that mark what we want it to be.</p>
                    <p>The foundation has been laid for a new relationship between the two most
                        powerful nations in the world. Now it is up to us—to all of us here in this
                        Chamber, to all of us across America—to join with other nations in building
                        a new house upon that foundation, one that can be a home for the hopes of
                        mankind and a shelter against the storms of conflict.</p>
                    <p>As a preliminary, therefore, to requesting your concurrence in some of the
                        agreements we reached and your approval of funds to carry out others, and
                        also as a keynote for the unity in which this Government and this Nation
                        must go forward from here, I am rendering this immediate report to the
                        Congress on the results of the Moscow summit.</p>
                    <p>The pattern of U.S.-Soviet summit diplomacy in the cold war era is well known
                        to all those in this Chamber. One meeting after another produced a brief
                        euphoric mood—the spirit of Geneva, the spirit of Camp David, the spirit of
                        Vienna, the spirit of Glassboro—but without producing significant progress
                        on the really difficult issues.</p>
                    <p>And so early in this Administration I stated that the prospect of concrete
                        results, not atmospherics, would be our criterion for meeting at the highest
                        level. I also announced our intention to pursue negotiations with the Soviet
                        Union across a broad front of related issues, with the purpose of creating a
                        momentum of achievement in which progress in one area could contribute to
                        progress in others.</p>
                    <p>This is the basis on which we prepared for and conducted last week's talks.
                        This was a working summit. We sought to establish not a superficial spirit
                        of Moscow, but a solid record of progress on solving the difficult issues
                        which for so long have divided our two nations and also have divided the
                        world. Reviewing the number and the scope of agreements that emerged, I
                        think we have accomplished that goal.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing the responsibility of the advanced industrial nations to set an
                        example in combatting mankind's common enemies, the United States and the
                        Soviet Union have agreed to cooperate in efforts to reduce pollution and
                        enhance environmental quality. We have agreed to work together in the field
                        of medical science and public health, particularly in the conquest of cancer
                        and heart disease.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing that the quest for useful knowledge transcends differences
                        between ideologies and social systems, we have agreed to expand United
                        States and Soviet cooperation in many areas of science and technology.</p>
                    <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0414"/>
                    <p>We have joined in plans for an exciting new adventure, a new adventure in the
                        cooperative exploration of space, which will begin—subject to Congressional
                        approval of funding—with a joint orbital mission of an Apollo vehicle and a
                        Soviet spacecraft in 1975.</p>
                    <p>By forming habits of cooperation and strengthening institutional ties in
                        areas of peaceful enterprise, these four agreements, to which I have
                        referred, will create on both sides a steadily growing vested interest in
                        the maintenance of good relations between our two countries.</p>
                    <p>Expanded United States-Soviet trade will also yield advantages to both of our
                        nations. When the two largest economies in the world start trading with each
                        other on a much larger scale, living standards in both nations will rise,
                        and the stake which both have in peace will increase.</p>
                    <p>Progress in this area is proceeding on schedule. At the summit, we
                        established a joint Commercial Commission which will complete the
                        negotiations for a comprehensive trade agreement between the United States
                        and the U.S.S.R. And we expect the final terms of this agreement to be
                        settled later this year.</p>
                    <p>Two further accords which were reached last week have a much more direct
                        bearing on the search for peace and security in the world.</p>
                    <p>One is the agreement between the American and Soviet navies aimed at
                        significantly reducing the chances of dangerous incidents between our ships
                        and aircraft at sea.</p>
                    <p>And second, and most important, there is the treaty and the related executive
                        agreement which will limit, for the first time, both offensive and defensive
                        strategic nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the United States and the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Three-fifths of all the people alive in the world today have spent their
                        whole lifetimes under the shadow of a nuclear war which could be touched off
                        by the arms race among the great powers. Last Friday in Moscow we witnessed
                        the beginning of the end of that era which began in 1945. We took the first
                        step toward a new era of mutually agreed restraint and arms limitation
                        between the two principal nuclear powers.</p>
                    <p>With this step we have enhanced the security of both nations. We have begun
                        to check the wasteful and dangerous spiral of nuclear arms which has
                        dominated relations between our two countries for a generation. We have
                        begun to reduce the level of fear by reducing the causes of fear, for our
                        two peoples and for all peoples in the world.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> Treaty will be submitted promptly for
                        the Senate's advice and consent to ratification and the interim agreement
                        limiting certain offensive weapons will be submitted to both Houses for
                        concurrence, because we can undertake agreements as important as these only
                        on a basis of full partnership between the executive and legislative
                        branches of our Government.</p>
                    <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0415"/>
                    <p>I ask from this Congress and I ask from the Nation the fullest scrutiny of
                        these accords. I am confident such examination will underscore the truth of
                        what I told the Soviet people on television just a few nights ago—that this
                        is an agreement in the interest of both nations. From the standpoint of the
                        United States, when we consider what the strategic balance would have looked
                        like later in the seventies, if there had been no arms limitation, it is
                        clear that the agreements forestall a major spiraling of the arms race—one
                        which would have worked to our disadvantage, since we have no current
                        building programs for the categories of weapons which have been frozen, and
                        since no new building program could have produced any new weapons in those
                        categories during the period of the freeze.</p>
                    <p>My colleagues in the Congress, I have studied the strategic balance in great
                        detail with my senior advisers for more than 3 years. I can assure you, the
                        Members of the Congress, and the American people tonight that the present
                        and planned strategic forces of the United States are without question
                        sufficient for the maintenance of our security and the protection of our
                        vital interests.</p>
                    <p>No power on earth is stronger than the United States of America today. And
                        none will be stronger than the United States of America in the future.</p>
                    <p>This is the only national defense posture which can ever be acceptable to the
                        United States. This is the posture I ask the Senate and the Congress to
                        protect by approving the arms limitation agreements to which I have
                        referred. This is the posture which, with the responsible cooperation of the
                        Congress, I will take all necessary steps to maintain in our future defense
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the talks which led to the specific agreements I have listed,
                        I also had full, very frank, and extensive discussions with General
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and his colleagues
                        about several parts of the world where American and Soviet interests have
                        come in conflict.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the reduction of tensions in Europe, we recorded our intention
                        of proceeding later this year with multilateral consultations looking toward
                        a conference on security and cooperation in all of Europe. We have also
                        jointly agreed to move forward with negotiations on mutual and balanced
                        force reductions in central Europe.</p>
                    <p>The problem of ending the Vietnam war, which engages the hopes of all
                        Americans, was one of the most extensively discussed subjects on our agenda.
                        It would only jeopardize the search for peace if I were to review here all
                        that was said on that subject. I will simply say this: Each side obviously
                        has its own point of view and its own approach to this very difficult issue.
                        But at the same time, both the United States and the Soviet Union share an
                        overriding desire to achieve a more stable peace <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396"
                            facs="0416"/>in the world. I emphasize to you once again that this
                        Administration has no higher goal, a goal that I know all of you share, than
                        bringing the Vietnam war to an early and honorable end. We are ending the
                        war in Vietnam, but we shall end it in a way which will not betray our
                        friends, risk the lives of the courageous Americans still serving in
                        Vietnam, break faith with those held prisoners by the enemy, or stain the
                        honor of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>Another area where we had very full, frank, and extensive discussions was the
                        Middle East. I reiterated the American people's commitment to the survival
                        of the state of Israel and to a settlement just to all the countries in the
                        area. Both sides stated in the communiqué their intention to support the
                        Jarring peace mission and other appropriate efforts to achieve this
                        objective.</p>
                    <p>The final achievement of the Moscow conference was the signing of a landmark
                        declaration entitled “Basic Principles of Mutual Relations Between the
                        United States and the U.S.S.R.”<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">
                            <ref target="#d116">Document 116</ref>.</note> As these 12 basic
                        principles are put into practice, they can provide a solid framework for the
                        future development of better American-Soviet relations.</p>
                    <p>They begin with the recognition that two nuclear nations, each of which has
                        the power to destroy humanity, have no alternative but to coexist
                        peacefully, because in a nuclear war there would be no winners, only
                        losers.</p>
                    <p>The basic principles commit both sides to avoid direct military confrontation
                        and to exercise constructive leadership and restraint with respect to
                        smaller conflicts in other parts of the world which could drag the major
                        powers into war.</p>
                    <p>They disavow any intention to create spheres of influence or to conspire
                        against the interests of any other nation—a point I would underscore by
                        saying once again tonight that America values its ties with all nations,
                        from our oldest allies in Europe and Asia, as I emphasized by my visit to
                        Iran, to our good friends in the third world, and to our new relationship
                        with the People's Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>The improvement of relations depends not only, of course, on words, but far
                        more on actions. The principles to which we agreed in Moscow are like a road
                        map. Now that the map has been laid out, it is up to each country to follow
                        it. The United States intends to adhere to these principles. The leaders of
                        the Soviet Union have indicated a similar intention.</p>
                    <p>However, we must remember that Soviet ideology still proclaims hostility to
                        some of America's most basic values. The Soviet leaders <pb n="397"
                            xml:id="pg_397" facs="0417"/>remain committed to that ideology. Like the
                        nation they lead, they are and they will continue to be totally dedicated
                        competitors of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>As we shape our policies for the period ahead, therefore, we must maintain
                        our defenses at an adequate level until there is mutual agreement to limit
                        forces. The time-tested policies of vigilance and firmness which have
                        brought us to this summit are the only ones that can safely carry us forward
                        to further progress in reaching agreements to reduce the danger of war.</p>
                    <p>Our successes in the strategic arms talks and in the Berlin negotiations,
                        which opened the road to Moscow, came about because over the past 3 years we
                        have consistently refused proposals for unilaterally abandoning the <gloss
                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, unilaterally pulling back our forces from
                        Europe, and drastically cutting the defense budget. The Congress deserves
                        the appreciation of the American people for having the courage to vote such
                        proposals down and to maintain the strength America needs to protect its
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>As we continue the strategic arms talks, seeking a permanent offensive
                        weapons treaty, we must bear the lessons of the earlier talks well in
                            mind.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">Documentation on the planning,

                                Relations</hi> volume.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>By the same token, we must stand steadfastly with our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners if negotiations leading to a new
                        détente and a mutual reduction of forces in Europe are to be productive.
                        Maintaining the strength, integrity, and steadfastness of our free world
                        alliances is the foundation on which all of our other initiatives for peace
                        and security in the world must rest. As we seek better relations with those
                        who have been our adversaries, we will not let down our friends and allies
                        around the world.</p>
                    <p>And in this period we must keep our economy vigorous and competitive if the
                        opening for greater East-West trade is to mean anything at all, and if we do
                        not wish to be shouldered aside in world markets by the growing potential of
                        the economies of Japan, Western Europe, the Soviet Union, the People's
                        Republic of China. For America to continue its role of helping to build a
                        more peaceful world, we must keep America number one economically in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>We must maintain our own momentum of domestic innovation, growth, and reform
                        if the opportunities for joint action with the Soviets are to fulfill their
                        promise. As we seek agreements to build peace abroad, we must keep America
                        moving forward at home.</p>
                    <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0418"/>
                    <p>Most importantly, if the new age we seek is ever to become a reality, we must
                        keep America strong in spirit—a nation proud of its greatness as a free
                        society, confident of its mission in the world. Let us be committed to our
                        way of life as wholeheartedly as the Communist leaders with whom we seek a
                        new relationship are committed to their system. Let us always be proud to
                        show in our words and actions what we know in our hearts—that we believe in
                        America.</p>
                    <p>These are just some of the challenges of peace. They are in some ways even
                        more difficult than the challenges of war. But we are equal to them. As we
                        meet them, we will be able to go forward and explore the sweeping
                        possibilities for peace which this season of summits has now opened up for
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>For decades, America has been locked in hostile confrontation with the two
                        great Communist powers, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
                        We were engaged with the one at many points and almost totally isolated from
                        the other, but our relationships with both had reached a deadly impasse. All
                        three countries were victims of the kind of bondage about which George
                        Washington long ago warned in these words: “The nation which indulges toward
                        another an habitual hatred … is a slave to its own animosity.”</p>
                    <p>But now in the brief space of 4 months, these journeys to Peking and to
                        Moscow have begun to free us from perpetual confrontation. We have moved
                        toward better understanding, mutual respect, point-by-point settlement of
                        differences with both the major Communist powers.</p>
                    <p>This one series of meetings has not rendered an imperfect world suddenly
                        perfect. There still are deep philosophical differences; there still are
                        parts of the world in which age-old hatreds persist. The threat of war has
                        not been eliminated—it has been reduced. We are making progress toward a
                        world in which leaders of nations will settle their differences by
                        negotiation, not by force, and in which they learn to live with their
                        differences so that their sons will not have to die for those
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>It was particularly fitting that this trip, aimed at building such a world,
                        should have concluded in Poland.</p>
                    <p>No country in the world has suffered more from war than Poland—and no country
                        has more to gain from peace. The faces of the people who gave us such a
                        heartwarming welcome in Warsaw yesterday, and then again this morning and
                        this afternoon, told an eloquent story of suffering from war in the past and
                        of hope for peace in the future. One could see it in their faces. It made me
                        more determined than ever that America must do all in its power to help that
                        hope for peace come true for all people in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0419"/>
                    <p>As we continue that effort, our unity of purpose and action will be
                        all-important.</p>
                    <p>For the summits of 1972 have not belonged just to one person or to one party
                        or to one branch of our Government alone. Rather they are part of a great
                        national journey for peace. Every American can claim a share in the credit
                        for the success of that journey so far, and every American has a major stake
                        in its success for the future.</p>
                    <p>An unparalleled opportunity has been placed in America's hands. Never has
                        there been a time when hope was more justified or when complacency was more
                        dangerous. We have made a good beginning. And because we have begun, history
                        now lays upon us a special obli-gation to see it through. We can seize this
                        moment or we can lose it; we can make good this opportunity to build a new
                        structure of peace in the world or we can let it slip away. Together,
                        therefore, let us seize the moment so that our children and the world's
                        children can live free of the fears and free of the hatreds that have been
                        the lot of mankind through the centuries.</p>
                    <p>Then the historians of some future age will write of the year 1972, not that
                        this was the year America went up to the summit and then down to the depths
                        of the valley again, but that this was the year when America helped to lead
                        the world up out of the lowlands of constant war, and onto the high plateau
                        of lasting peace.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is a very brief introductory comment by <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>In considering the two agreements before the Congress, the treaty on the
                        limitation of antiballistic missile systems and the interim agreement on the
                        limitation of offensive arms,<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">The Strategic Arms
                            Limitation Treaties (<gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> ) were signed
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and General
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in Moscow on
                            May 26. The signing was a major highlight of the Moscow Summit
                            meeting.</note> the overriding questions are these: Do these agreements
                        permit the United States to maintain a defense posture that guarantees our
                        security and protects our vital interests? Second, will they lead to a more
                        enduring structure of peace?</p>
                    <p>In the course of the formal hearings over the coming days and weeks, the
                        Administration will demonstrate conclusively that they serve both of these
                        ends. I will begin that process this morning by offering some general
                        remarks on the agreement, after which I will be happy to take your
                        questions.</p>
                    <p rend="center">U.S.-Soviet Relations in the 1970's</p>
                    <p>The first part of my remarks will deal with U.S.-Soviet relations as they
                        affect these agreements. The agreement which was signed 46 minutes before
                        midnight in Moscow on the evening of May 26th by President <persName
                            corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and General Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is without precedent in the
                        nuclear age; indeed, in all relevant modern history.</p>
                    <p>Never before have the world's two most powerful nations, divided by ideology,
                        history and conflicting interests, placed their central armaments under
                        formally agreed limitation and restraint. It is fair to ask: What new
                        conditions now prevail to have made this step commend itself to the
                        calculated self-interests of both of the so-called superpowers, as it so
                        clearly must have done for both willingly to undertake it?</p>
                    <p>Let me start, therefore, with a sketch of the broad design of what the
                        President has been trying to achieve in this country's relations with the
                        Soviet Union, since at each important turning point in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> negotiations we were guided not so much
                        by the tactical solution that seemed most equitable or prudent, important as
                        it was, but by an <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0421"/>underlying
                        philosophy and a specific perception of international reality.</p>
                    <p>The international situation has been undergoing a profound structural change
                        since at least the mid-1960s. The post-World War II pattern of relations
                        among the great powers had been altered to the point that when this
                        Administration took office, a major reassessment was clearly in order.</p>
                    <p>The nations that had been prostrate in 1945 had regained their economic
                        strength and their political vitality. The Communist bloc was divided into
                        contending factions, and nationalistic forces and social and economic
                        pressures were reasserting themselves within the individual Communist
                        states.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps most important for the United States, our undisputed strategic
                        predominance was declining just at a time when there was rising domestic
                        resistance to military programs, and impatience for redistribution of
                        resources from national defense to social demands.</p>
                    <p>Amidst all of this profound change, however, there was one important
                        constant—the continuing dependence of most of the world's hopes for
                        stability and peace upon the ability to reduce the tensions between the
                        United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The factors which perpetuated that rivalry remain real and deep.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We are ideological adversaries, and we will in all likelihood remain so
                            for the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>We are political and military competitors, and neither can be indifferent
                            to advances by the other in either of these fields.</p>
                        <p>We each have allies whose association we value and whose interests and
                            activities of each impinge on those of the other at numerous points.</p>
                        <p>We each possess an awesome nuclear force created and designed to meet the
                            threat implicit in the other's strength and aims.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Each of us has thus come into possession of power singlehandedly capable of
                        exterminating the human race. Paradoxically, this very fact, and the global
                        interest of both sides, create a certain commonality of outlook, a sort of
                        interdependence for survival between the two of us.</p>
                    <p>Although we compete, the conflict will not admit of resolution by victory in
                        the classical sense. We are compelled to coexist. We have an inescapable
                        obligation to build jointly a structure for peace. Recognition of this
                        reality is the beginning of wisdom for a sane and effective foreign policy
                        today.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has made it the
                        starting point of the United States policy since 1969. This Administration's
                        policy is occasionally characterized as being based on the principles of the
                        classical balance of power. To the extent that that term implies a belief
                        that security requires a measure of equilibrium, it has a certain validity.
                        No national leader has the right to mortgage the survival of his people to
                        the good will of <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0422"/>another state. We
                        must seek firmer restraints on the actions of potentially hostile states
                        than a sanguine appeal to their good nature.</p>
                    <p>But to the extent that balance of power means constant jockeying for marginal
                        advantages over an opponent, it no longer applies. The reason is that the
                        determination of national power has changed fundamentally in the nuclear
                        age. Throughout history, the primary concern of most national leaders has
                        been to accumulate geopolitical and military power. It would have seemed
                        inconceivable even a generation ago that such power once gained could not be
                        translated directly into advantage over one's opponent. But now both we and
                        the Soviet Union have begun to find that each increment of power does not
                        necessarily represent an increment of usable political strength.</p>
                    <p>With modern weapons, a potentially decisive advantage requires a change of
                        such magnitude that the mere effort to obtain it can produce disaster. The
                        simple tit-for-tat reaction to each other's programs of a decade ago is in
                        danger of being overtaken by a more or less simultaneous and continuous
                        process of technological advance, which opens more and more temptations for
                        seeking decisive advantage.</p>
                    <p>A premium is put on striking first and on creating a defense to blunt the
                        other side's retaliatory capability. In other words, marginal additions of
                        power cannot be decisive. Potentially decisive additions are extremely
                        dangerous, and the quest for them are destabilizing. The argument that arms
                        races produce war has often been exaggerated. The nuclear age is
                        overshadowed by its peril.</p>
                    <p>All of this was in the President's mind as he mapped the new directions of
                        American policy at the outset of this Administration. There was reason to
                        believe that the Soviet leadership might also be thinking along similar
                        lines as the repeated failure of their attempts to gain marginal advantage
                        in local crises or in military competition underlined the limitation of old
                        policy approaches.</p>
                    <p>The President, therefore, decided that the United States should work to
                        create a set of circumstances which would offer the Soviet leaders an
                        opportunity to move away from confrontation through carefully prepared
                        negotiations. From the first, we rejected the notion that what was lacking
                        was a cordial climate for conducting negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Past experience has amply shown that much heralded changes in atmospherics,
                        but not buttressed by concrete progress, will revert to previous patterns at
                        the first subsequent clash of interests.</p>
                    <p>We have, instead, sought to move forward across a broad range of issues so
                        that progress in one area would add momentum to the progress of other
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>We hoped that the Soviet Union would acquire a stake in a wide spectrum of
                        negotiations and that it would become convinced that its <pb n="403"
                            xml:id="pg_403" facs="0423"/>interests would be best served if the
                        entire process unfolded. We have sought, in short, to create a vested
                        interest in mutual restraint.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we were acutely conscious of the contradictory tendencies
                        at work in Soviet policy. Some factors—such as the fear of nuclear war; the
                        emerging consumer economy, and the increased pressures of a technological,
                        administrative society—have encouraged the Soviet leaders to seek a more
                        stable relationship with the United States. Other factors—such as ideology,
                        bureaucratic inertia, and the catalytic effect of turmoil in peripheral
                        areas—have prompted pressures for tactical gains.</p>
                    <p>The President has met each of these manifestations on its own terms,
                        demonstrating receptivity to constructive Soviet initiatives and firmness in
                        the face of provocations or adventurism. He has kept open a private channel
                        through which the two sides could communicate candidly and settle matters
                        rapidly. The President was convinced that agreements dealing with questions
                        of armaments in isolation do not, in fact, produce lasting inhibitions on
                        military competition because they contribute little to the kind of stability
                        that makes crises less likely. In recent months, major progress was achieved
                        in moving toward a broadly-based accommodation of interests with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in which an arms limitation agreement
                        could be a central element.</p>
                    <p>This approach was called linkage, not by the Administration, and became the
                        object of considerable debate in 1969. Now, three years later, the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreement does not stand alone, isolated
                        and incongruous in the relationship of hostility, vulnerable at any moment
                        to the shock of some sudden crisis. It stands, rather, linked organically,
                        to a chain of agreements and to a broad understanding about international
                        conduct appropriate to the dangers of the nuclear age.</p>
                    <p>The agreements on the limitation of strategic arms is, thus, not merely a
                        technical accomplishment, although it is that in part, but it must be seen
                        as political event of some magnitude. This is relevant to the question of
                        whether the agreements will be easily breached or circumvented. Given the
                        past, no one can answer the question with certainty, but it can be said with
                        some assurance that any country which contemplates a rupture of the
                        agreement or a circumvention of its letter and spirit must now face the fact
                        that it will be placing in jeopardy not only a limited arms control
                        agreement, but a broad political relationship.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is a review of the preparation for the arms talks and the
                        provisions of the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreements.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">What Do the Agreements Mean?</p>
                    <p>Taking the longer perspective, what can we say has been accomplished?</p>
                    <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0424"/>
                    <list>
                        <item>
                            <p>First, it is clear that the agreement will enhance the security of
                                both sides. No agreement which fails to do so could have been signed
                                in the first place or stood any chance of lasting after it was
                                signed. An attempt to gain a unilateral advantage in the strategic
                                field must be self-defeating.</p>
                            <p>The President has given the most careful consideration to the final
                                terms. He has asked me to reiterate most emphatically this morning
                                his conviction that the agreements fully protect our national
                                security and our vital interests.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            <p>Secondly, the President is determined that our security and vital
                                interests shall remain fully protected. If the Senate consents to
                                ratification of the treaty and if the Congress approves the interim
                                agreement, the Administration will, therefore, pursue two parallel
                                courses.</p>
                            <p>On the one hand, we shall push the next phase of the Strategic Arms
                                Limitation Talks with the same energy and conviction that have
                                produced these initial agreements.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, until further arms limits are negotiated, we shall
                                push research and development and the production capacity to remain
                                in a fully protected strategic posture should follow-on agreements
                                prove unattainable and so as to avoid giving the other side a
                                temptation to break out of the agreement.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>Third, the President believes that these agreements, embedded as they
                            are in the fabric of an emerging new relationship, can hold tremendous
                            political and historical significance in the coming decades. For the
                            first time, two great powers, deeply divided by their divergent values,
                            philosophies, and social systems, have agreed to restrain the very
                            armaments on which their national survival depends. No decision of this
                            magnitude could have been taken unless it had been part of a larger
                            decision to place relations on a new foundation of restraint,
                            cooperation and steadily evolving confidence. A spectrum of agreements
                            on joint effort with regard to the environment, space, health, and
                            promising negotiations on economic relations provides a prospect for
                            avoiding the failure of the Washington Naval Treaty and the
                            Kellogg-Briand pact outlawing war which collapsed in part for lack of an
                            adequate political foundation.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The final verdict must wait on events, but there is at least reason to hope
                        that these accords represent a major break in the pattern of suspicion,
                        hostility, and confrontation which has dominated U.S.-Soviet relations for a
                        generation. The two great nuclear powers must not let this opportunity slip
                        away by jockeying for marginal advantages.</p>
                    <p>Inevitably an agreement of such consequence raises serious questions on the
                        part of concerned individuals of quite different persuasions. I cannot do
                        justice to all of them here. Let me deal with some of <pb n="405"
                            xml:id="pg_405" facs="0425"/>the most frequently asked since the
                        agreements were signed three weeks ago.</p>
                    <p>Who won?</p>
                    <p>The President has already answered this question. He has stressed that it is
                        inappropriate to pose the question in terms of victory or defeat. In an
                        agreement of this kind, either both sides win or both sides lose. This will
                        either be a serious attempt to turn the world away from time-worn practices
                        of jockeying for power, or there will be endless, wasteful and purposeless
                        competition in the acquisition of armaments.</p>
                    <p>Does the agreement perpetuate a U.S. strategic disadvantage?</p>
                    <p>We reject the premise of that question on two grounds. First, the present
                        situation is on balance advantageous to the United States. Second, the
                        Interim Agreement perpetuates nothing which did not already exist in fact
                        and which could only have gotten worse without an agreement.</p>
                    <p>Our present strategic military situation is sound. Much of the criticism has
                        focused on the imbalance in number of missiles between the U.S. and the
                        Soviet Union. But, this only examines one aspect of the problem. To assess
                        the overall balance it is necessary to consider those forces not in the
                        agreement; our bomber force which is substantially larger and more effective
                        than the Soviet bomber force, and our forward base systems.</p>
                    <p>The quality of the weapons must also be weighed. We are confident we have
                        major advantage in nuclear weapons technology and in warhead accuracy. Also,
                        with our <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s we have a two-to-one lead
                        today in numbers of warheads and this lead will be maintained during the
                        period of the agreement, even if the Soviets develop and deploy <gloss
                            target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>'s of their own.</p>
                    <p>Then there are such factors as deployment characteristics. For example,
                        because of the difference in geography and basing, it has been estimated
                        that the Soviet Union requires three submarines for two of ours to be able
                        to keep an equal number on station.</p>
                    <p>When the total picture is viewed, our strategic forces are seen to be
                        completely sufficient.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have more missile launchers, but when other relevant systems such
                        as bombers are counted there are roughly the same number of launchers on
                        each side. We have a big advantage on warheads. The Soviets have an
                        advantage on megatonnage.</p>
                    <p>What is disadvantageous to us, though, is the trend of new weapons deployment
                        by the Soviet Union and the projected imbalance five years hence based on
                        that trend. The relevant question to ask, therefore, is what the freeze
                        prevents; where would we be by 1977 without a <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406"
                            facs="0426"/>freeze? Considering the current momentum by the Soviet
                        Union, in both <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>'s and submarine
                        launched ballistic missiles, the ceiling set in the Interim Agreement can
                        only be interpreted as a sound arrangement that makes a major contribution
                        to our national security.</p>
                    <p>Does the agreement jeopardize our security in the future?</p>
                    <p>The current arms race compounds numbers by technology. The Soviet Union has
                        proved that it can best compete in sheer numbers. This is the area which is
                        limited by the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Thus the agreement confines the competition with the Soviets to the area of
                        technology. And, heretofore, we have had a significant advantage.</p>
                    <p>The follow-on negotiations will attempt to bring the technological race under
                        control. Until these negotiations succeed, we must take care not to
                        anticipate their outcome by unilateral decisions.</p>
                    <p>Can we trust the Soviets?</p>
                    <p>The possibility always exists that the Soviets will treat the Moscow
                        agreements as they have sometimes treated earlier ones, as just another
                        tactical opportunity in the protracted conflict. If this happens, the United
                        States will have to respond. This we shall plan to prepare to do
                        psychologically and strategically and provided the Congress accepts the
                        strategic programs on which the acceptance of the agreements was
                        predicated.</p>
                    <p>I have said enough to indicate we advocate these agreements not on the basis
                        of trust, but on the basis of the enlightened self-interests of both sides.
                        This self-interest is reinforced by the carefully drafted verification
                        provisions in the agreement. Beyond the legal obligations, both sides have a
                        stake in all of the agreements that have been signed, and a large stake in
                        the broad process of improvement in relations that has begun. The Soviet
                        leaders are serious men, and we are confident that they will not lightly
                        abandon the course that has led to the summit meeting and to these initial
                        agreements. For our own part, we will not abandon this course without major
                        provocation, because it is in the interest of this country and in the
                        interest of mankind to pursue it.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Prospects for the Future</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the Moscow summit, the President and General Secretary
                        signed a Declaration of Principles to govern the future relationship between
                        the United States and the Soviet Union.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">
                            <ref target="#d116">Document 116</ref>.</note> These principles state
                        that there is no alternative to peaceful coexistence <pb n="407"
                            xml:id="pg_407" facs="0427"/>in the nuclear age. They commit both sides
                        to avoid direct armed confrontation, to use restraint in local conflicts, to
                        assert no special claims in derogation of the sovereign equality of all
                        nations, to stress cooperation and negotiation at all points of our
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>At this point, these principles reflect an aspiration and an attitude. This
                        Administration will spare no effort to translate the aspiration into
                        reality. We shall strive with determination to overcome further the miasma
                        of suspicion and self-confirming preemptive actions which have characterized
                        the Cold War.</p>
                    <p>Of course the temptation is to continue along well worn paths. The status quo
                        has the advantage of reality, but history is strewn with the wreckage of
                        nations which sought their future in their past. Catastrophe has resulted
                        far less often from conscious decisions than from the fear of breaking loose
                        from established patterns through the inexorable march towards cataclysm
                        because nobody knew what else to do. The paralysis of policy which destroyed
                        Europe in 1914 would surely destroy the world if we let it happen again in
                        the nuclear age.</p>
                    <p>Thus the deepest question we ask is not whether we can trust the Soviets, but
                        whether we can trust ourselves. Some have expressed concern about the
                        agreements not because they object to their terms, but because they are
                        afraid of the euphoria that these agreements might produce.</p>
                    <p>But surely we cannot be asked to maintain unavoidable tension just to carry
                        out programs which our national survival should dictate in any event. We
                        must not develop a national psychology by which we can act only on the basis
                        of what we are against and not on what we are for.</p>
                    <p>Our challenges then are: Can we chart a new course with hope but without
                        illusion, with large purposes but without sentimentality? Can we be both
                        generous and strong? It is not often that a country has the opportunity to
                        answer such questions meaningfully. We are now at such a juncture where
                        peace and progress depend on our faith and our fortitude.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here is commentary on domestic politics.]</p>
                    <p>As we look at what happened with the Chinese and Soviets, the reason China
                        and the U.S. finally got together is not because we or they finally reached
                        the conclusion that we had been mistaken. It was because at this juncture in
                        history there were very fundamental shifts in the world balance of power
                        that made it imperative that they look elsewhere, and useful to us to have
                        better relations with them.</p>
                    <p>The leaders of the Chinese government are more dedicated to Communism as an
                        ideology than the Soviets, because they are in an earlier stage. Also, they
                        are more dedicated to supporting the “third world.” They consider themselves
                        weak. When it comes to Africa, to Southeast Asia, to the Middle East—the
                        Chinese speak out strongly to those nations. Also, for another reason—not
                        because they love all those people, but also because the overriding Chinese
                        and Russian concern is the fact that both are in competition for the
                        leadership of the Communist world. When the Russians are trying to make an
                        accommodation with the major powers, the Chinese see this as an opportunity
                        to make gains with minor powers around the world. This hasn't worked very
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental point, however, is why the Chinese felt it was in their
                        interest. Put yourself in the position of the Chinese leaders—with 800
                        million people, on one border they see the Russians, with more men there
                        than against Western Europe. To the south, there is India. The Chinese have
                        contempt for the Indians, after the 1962 war. But it gives them pause to see
                        what India could do with the support of the Soviets against China's friend,
                        Pakistan. To the northeast, they see Japan. They have no reason to fear
                        Japan, because Japan has no nuclear weapons. But they have enormous respect
                        for Japan, which has invaded and occupied China. Also, Japan is now the
                        third and will soon be the second economic power in the world, and they
                        could well develop nuclear weapons soon on the industrial base that they
                        have.</p>
                    <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0429"/>
                    <p>Then there's the U.S. As far as our system is concerned, we are much more
                        antagonistic toward them than anyone else. <persName corresp="#p_MZMT1"
                            >Mao</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZECE1">Chou</persName> make no
                        decisions on a personal basis—only on cold calculation—which is true of most
                        world leaders.</p>
                    <p>So, if you were the Chinese—you would welcome better relations with the
                        U.S.—given on one flank not an enemy at the very least, and also a nation
                        that because of its interest might restrain some of China's neighbors.</p>
                    <p>One of the major Chinese doctrines is that Japan must never rearm. Also they
                        say that the U.S. and Japan should dissolve our defense arrangement. But
                        they don't want this. Japan, unprotected, facing Russia and China with its
                        enormous economic capacity is not going to be neutral—it will either go with
                        one of the others or rearm. The Chinese know that.</p>
                    <p>These clowns who write for the media do not understand this. They see it all
                        in terms of their own prejudices from the past.</p>
                    <p>Now look at the Soviet Union—why is the Soviet Union interested in talking to
                        the U.S. in a number of fields? While they of course jump through the
                        ceiling if you talk about linkage, they link everything.</p>
                    <p>What are the Soviet Union's problems? They look at China—they know they have
                        nothing to fear now from China, but they also know what they themselves have
                        done economically in 50 years in a relatively backward country. They respect
                        the Chinese people. They know that a billion Chinese in 25 years could be an
                        enormous threat in the future.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets' major purpose with the U.S. is to weaken the European alliance,
                        and to erase the idea that the Soviets pose any threat to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As they look to the future, they realize their interests at this time would
                        not be served by allowing the U.S.-Chinese opening to ripen into, not
                        friendship, but a possible accommodation which down the road might threaten
                        them.</p>
                    <p>So—did we go to China to play against the Soviets, and vice versa? We have to
                        say no. If we ever said yes, they'd have to react the other way. But put
                        yourself in their position.</p>
                    <p>On arms control, there would have been no agreement whatever if we hadn't had
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. And we won that by only one vote in
                        the Senate.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are no more interested in peace as an end in itself than the
                        Fascists were. They prefer it. Their people don't want war. But the
                        leaders—their goals, while not as violently expressed as the Chinese, have
                        not changed. They still want Communism to spread to other countries, by
                        subversion perhaps. They play it down. No Soviet soldier has been lost since
                        World War II. But, because they have avoided a military confrontation with
                        the U.S., this does not mean that the Soviet leaders <pb n="410"
                            xml:id="pg_410" facs="0430"/>have abandoned their ultimate goal—the
                        victory of Communism in other areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>Every one of the Eastern European countries is a potential problem for the
                        Soviet Union except for perhaps Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p>These countries are pulled toward Western Europe. They have differences with
                        the Russians. Communism hasn't sunk in there. So the Russians have Eastern
                        Europe on one side, China on the other—and also internal problems.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who has gone to the Soviet Union 12 years ago, and again now, has to
                        be impressed by the changes. But theirs is still a very primitive society by
                        our standards. They want more consumer goods. So—where's the logical place
                        to turn? France and England don't matter any more. The Soviet and Chinese
                        leaders are total pragmatists. They know where the power is.</p>
                    <p>Unless the U.S. has not only military strength, but also leadership that
                        makes us respected and credible, they wouldn't be interested in talking to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>That's why I took the action I did in mining Haiphong.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d119fn2">See <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> If
                        we were to lose in Vietnam, it would have pleased the Soviets and the
                        Chinese, but there would have been no respect for the American President, no
                        matter who he was—because we had power and didn't use it. When U.S. does
                        become involved, we must be credible. We must stand by our commitments, our
                        allies, our friends.</p>
                    <p>So the Soviets look at the situation—the arms race—in major categories, they
                        have caught us. They do respect our enormous economic power, and they
                        believe if they get into a race with us on the military side, they cannot
                        hope to gain an advantage and win it.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have reached these agreements.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is commentary relating to defense issues.]</p>
                    <p>I'm convinced that as a result of what we have done, the chances of having a
                        more peaceful world 50 years from now are substantially increased. But this
                        would not have been done with woolly-headed idealism. If we've come this
                        far, it is because we have not been belligerent, we have avoided
                        exacerbating the problem by engaging in a shouting match. Our personal
                        relationship is as good as it can be. I never believe in letting personal
                        relationships make difficult decisions more difficult. But—you've got to put
                        yourself in their position—how are they going to evaluate us? If they think
                        we are weak, they are going to pounce on us. If they think we are strong,
                        they are going to deal with us.</p>

                        relating to trade.]</p>
                    <p>The President said that eventually we have to look to the longer term aspects
                        of our relations in broader focus. For the present, we have a tough line.
                        For example, his speech to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            meeting<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">
                            <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> will not be forthcoming
                        on trade matters. However, we should understand that more is involved here
                        than just questions of “horse-trading between soybeans and cheese.”</p>
                    <p>The real question was what do the Europeans want their position vis-à-vis the
                        U.S. and the Soviet Union to be? Does Europe want to go the route of a
                        “Finlandization” of Europe? If they adopt an anti-U.S. trade policy,
                        resulting in “an unenthusiastic” attitude in the U.S. about Europe, they
                        must be made to understand that it will carry over into the political
                            area.<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could blow apart. The idea
                        that the Europeans can defend themselves without us is “bull.” If <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> comes apart, they will be in a position
                        of being economic giants and military pygmies. Cutting themselves off from
                        the U.S. risks a more subtle form of invasion by the Soviet Union than in
                        the conventional military sense.</p>
                    <p>European leaders, he said, are “terrified” at that prospect. However, “the
                        economic guys over there just want to screw us and our economic guys should
                        want to do the same. There ought to be a lot of screwing going on.”</p>
                    <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0432"/>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the political aspects of our relations should be overriding for
                        both sides. Between now and the elections, we should say nothing, but we
                        should be giving careful thought about how trade relations fit into the
                        context of our overall relations. We need to examine the trade prices which
                        both we and they will have to pay for the continued strength of our overall
                        relations. “We cannot allow the umbilical cord to be cut and Europe to be
                        nibbled away by the Soviets.” We need to strengthen the bonds of trade,
                        monetary relations, parliamentary exchanges, etc.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate his point, the President recalled that, in watching the 100
                        meter race of the Olympics, he was struck by the remarks of the Soviet
                        winner. Borzov said that the “race marked the end of an era and now the
                        Europeans are the best.” This was an example of the new style, according to
                        which the Soviets are trying to identify themselves with the Europeans and
                        against the U.S. Basically this example was just white racism (since our
                        runners were black), but the idea of Europe versus the U.S. is a Soviet
                        line. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> say almost the same thing.</p>
                    <p>Free Europeans know they would be out of their minds to come under this
                        influence. They know we have the divisions and the nuclear weapons. It is
                        easy to say we will take them out of Europe, but it is definitely not in our
                        interest to do so. Nevertheless, there is a growing sentiment in the U.S. to
                        the effect of “damn the Europeans” and “the foreigners are doing us in.”</p>
                    <p>It is true that the foreigners are treating us badly and understandable that
                        we should want to do them in too. However, he urged that we be under no
                        illusions. We cannot turn isolationist in the broader context. If we were
                        only looking at trade, we could get along without the Europeans or the rest
                        of the world, since trade is much less important to our <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> than it is to others. Trade is “the froth
                        on top of the beer” but “beer without froth does not taste too bad.”</p>
                    <p>However, trade is part of a bigger package. For instance, we have to treat
                        Japan with “tender loving care” since, what Europe could become to the
                        Soviets, Japan to China would be even more. Trade is important politically,
                        and good trade relations can contribute to good overall relations. We must
                        realize that our interests can be served by being as tough as we can without
                        going over the line where anti-U.S. sentiment will cause them to turn
                        against us and break with us. The Europeans recognize that they do not
                        matter in the world anymore, and thus they concentrate on economic issues
                        which are more important to them. That means that we may have to give more
                        than our trade interest, strictly construed, would require. However, for the
                        moment, we should let them know that a lot of Americans would welcome a
                        trade <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0433"/>split with Europe. We should
                        stress that the Administration is fighting against this, but the Europeans
                        should realize why we are doing it. It is not because our economic survival
                        is at stake but rather that we value our overall relations very highly, in
                        the interest of world peace.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, they must understand that our economic relations affect our
                        leadership position in the world. In the future, our relations will have a
                        larger economic content and this will require more subtlety in the way we
                        conduct our overall relations. We are best at this game because we are
                        strongest.</p>
                    <p>This is not the time to fix on a major strategy. After the elections is the
                        time to do this. Then we can do what we have to do. It is going to be very
                        hard to sell trade liberalization to the Congress. We will be prepared to do
                        it because we know that more is at stake than just trade. But for now we
                        should not talk in public about the political-commercial trade-off.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Peterson asked what the possibilities looked like for a longer term
                        political-security-trade linkage in our relations with Europe, and the
                        prospects of selling liberalization bill to Congress.</p>
                    <p>The President said that if we do well in the elections, for a few months we
                        can get quite a lot from the Congress. This does not mean we need a
                        landslide but just a good majority. With that, we can make a major move to
                        propose what is best for the country and to educate the country so that it
                        sees the issues in the broader context.</p>
                    <p>We have to be able to show the country that there is a major shift in the
                        world balance of power, particularly as among ourselves, the Russians, the
                        Chinese and the Japanese. As regards Europe, the Europeans “will have one
                        hell of a time acting as a bloc.” They do not get along with each other and
                        it will be some time before they can learn to act as a group. This means we
                        have to work with the heads of government in the various countries and not
                        “that jackass” in the European Commission in Brussels.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>The President said that it is important that, after the elections, we look at
                        the long-range relations. We have to tie this in with the whole political
                        problem of what we want our relations with Europe to be. “We have to think
                        internationally—we're it in the Free World.” We would miss a great
                        opportunity if we do not see these relations in broader terms and be guided
                        by the broader picture. Then we can move to educate the public as to how it
                        is in their own self-interest. However, we may also be able to get something
                        in the economic area by using our political-security leverage.</p>

                            1972</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>[Omitted here are brief introductory comments.]</p>
                    <p>I am convinced, on the basis of the evidence of the past year, that we are
                        not only participating today in a great moment in history, but that we are
                        witnessing and helping to create a profound movement in history.</p>
                    <p>That movement is away from the resolution of potential conflict by war, and
                        toward its resolution through peaceful means. The experienced people
                        gathered in this room are not so naive as to expect the smoothing out of all
                        differences between peoples and between nations. We anticipate that the
                        potential for conflict will exist as long as men and nations have different
                        interests, different approaches, different ideals.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we must come to grips with the paradoxes of peace. As the danger
                        of armed conflict between major powers is reduced, the potential for
                        economic conflict increases. As the possibility of peace grows stronger,
                        some of the original ties that first bound our postwar alliances together
                        grow weaker. As nations around the world gain new economic strength, the
                        points of commercial contact multiply along with the possibilities of
                        disagreements.</p>
                    <p>There is another irony that we should recognize on this occasion. With one
                        exception, the nations gathered here whose domestic economies are growing so
                        strongly today can trace much of their postwar growth to the expansion of
                        international trade. The one exception is the United States—the industrial
                        nation with by far the smallest percentage of its gross national product in
                        world trade.</p>
                    <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0435"/>
                    <p>Why, then, is the United States—seemingly with the least at stake—in the
                        forefront of those working for prompt and thoroughgoing reform of the
                        international monetary system, with all that will mean for the expansion of
                        trade now and in the future?</p>
                    <p>One reason, of course, is our national self-interest. We want our working men
                        and women, our business men and women, to have a fair chance to compete for
                        their share of the expanding trade between nations. A generation ago, at the
                        end of World War II, we deliberately set out to help our former enemies as
                        well as our weakened allies, so that they would inevitably gain the economic
                        strength which would enable them to compete with us in world markets. And
                        now we expect our trading partners to help bring about equal and fair
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>There is another reason, more far-reaching and fundamental, that motivates
                        the United States in pressing for economic and monetary reform.</p>
                    <p>Working together, we must set in place an economic structure that will help
                        and not hinder the world's historic movement toward peace.</p>
                    <p>We must make certain that international commerce becomes a source of
                        stability and harmony, rather than a cause of friction and animosity.</p>
                    <p>Potential conflict must be channeled into cooperative competition. That is
                        why the structure of the international monetary system and the future system
                        of world trade are so central to our concerns today. The time has come for
                        action across the entire front of international economic problems. Recurring
                        monetary crises such as we have experienced all too often in the past
                        decade, unfair currency alignments and trading agreements which put the
                        workers of one nation at a disadvantage with workers of another nation,
                        great disparities in development that breed resentment, a monetary system
                        that makes no provision for the realities of the present and the needs of
                        the future—all these not only injure our economies, they also create
                        political tensions that subvert the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>There must be a thoroughgoing reform of the world monetary system to clear
                        the path for the healthy economic competition of the future.</p>
                    <p>We must see monetary reform as one part of a total reform of international
                        economic affairs encompassing trade and investment opportunity for all.</p>
                    <p>We must create a realistic code of economic conduct to guide our mutual
                        relations—a code which allows governments freedom to pursue legitimate
                        domestic objectives, but which also gives them good reason to abide by
                        agreed principles of international behavior.</p>
                    <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0436"/>
                    <p>Each nation must exercise the power of its example in the realistic and
                        orderly conduct of internal economic affairs so that each nation exports its
                        products and not its problems.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are comments relating to domestic economic matters and to
                        recently concluded agreements with the Soviet Union.]</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the issues that divide us are many and they are very
                        serious and infinitely complex and difficult. But the impetus that will make
                        this negotiation successful is the force that unites us all, all the 124
                        nations represented here today: that is a common need to establish a sound
                        and abiding foundation for commerce, leading to a better way of life for all
                        the citizens of all the nations here and all the citizens of the world.</p>
                    <p>That common need, let us call it the world interest, demands a new freedom of
                        world trade, a new fairness in international economic conduct.</p>
                    <p>It is a mark of our maturity that we now see that an unfair advantage gained
                        in an agreement today only sabotages that agreement tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>I well remember when I was a first-year law student, 32 years ago, what the
                        professor of contracts said as he opened the course. He said, “A contract is
                        only as good as the will of the parties to keep it.”</p>
                    <p>The only system that can work is one that each nation has an active interest
                        in making work. The need is self-evident. The will to reform the monetary
                        system is here in this room, and, in a proverb that has its counterpart in
                        almost every language here, where there is a will there is a way.</p>
                    <p>We are gathered to create a responsible monetary system, responsive to the
                        need for stability and openness, and responsive to the need of each country
                        to reflect its unique character.</p>
                    <p>In this way we bring to bear one of the great lessons of federalism: that
                        often the best way to enforce an agreed-upon discipline is to let each
                        member take action to adhere to it in the way that is best suited to its
                        local character, its stage of development, its economic structure.</p>
                    <p>For its part, I can assure you, the United States will continue to rise to
                        its world responsibilities, joining with other nations to create and
                        participate in a modern world economic order.</p>
                    <p>We are secure enough in our independence to freely assert our
                        interdependence.</p>
                    <p>These are the principles that I profoundly believe should and will guide the
                        United States in its international economic conduct now and in the years
                        ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0437"/>
                    <p>We shall press for a more equitable and a more open world of trade. We shall
                        meet competition rather than run away from it.</p>
                    <p>We shall be a stimulating trading partner, a straightforward bargainer.</p>
                    <p>We shall not turn inward and isolationist.</p>
                    <p>In turn we shall look to our friends for evidence of similar rejection of
                        isolationism in economic and political affairs.</p>
                    <p>Let us all resolve to look at the ledgers of international commerce today
                        with new eyes—to see that there is no heroism in a temporary surplus nor
                        villainy in a temporary deficit, but to see that progress is possible only
                        in the framework of long-term equilibrium. In this regard we must take bold
                        action toward a more equitable and a more open world trading order.</p>
                    <p>Like every leader of the nations represented here, I want to see new jobs
                        created all over the world, but I cannot condone the export of jobs out of
                        the United States caused by any unfairness built into the world's trading
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Let all nations in the more advanced stages of industrial development share
                        the responsibility of helping those countries whose major development lies
                        ahead, and let the great industrial nations, in offering that help, in
                        providing it, forgo the temptation to use that help as an instrument of
                        domination, discrimination, or rivalry.</p>
                    <p>Far more is at stake here than the mechanics of commerce and finance. At
                        stake is the chance to add genuine opportunity to the lives of people,
                        hundreds of millions of people in all nations, the chance to add stability
                        and security to the savings and earnings of hundreds of millions of people
                        in all of our nations, the chance to add economic muscle to the sinews of
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>I have spoken this morning in general terms about how we can advance our
                        economic interdependence. Later this week, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> will outline a number of proposals
                        which represent the best thinking of my top economic advisers. I commend
                        those proposals to you for your careful consideration.<note n="2"

                    </p>
                    <p>The word “economics,” traced to its Greek root, means “the law of the
                        house.”</p>
                    <p>This house we live in—this community of nations—needs far better laws to
                        guide our future economic conduct. Every nation can prosper and benefit
                        working within a modern world economic order that it has a stake in
                        preserving.</p>
                    <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0438"/>
                    <p>Now, very little of what is done in these negotiations will be widely
                        understood in this country or in any of your countries as well. And very
                        little of it will be generally appreciated.</p>
                    <p>But history will record the vital nature of the challenge before us. I am
                        confident that the men and the nations gathered here will seize the
                        opportunity to create a monetary and trading system that will work for the
                        coming generation—and will help to shape the years ahead into a generation
                        of peace for all nations in the world.</p>

                    <p>The nations gathered here have it in their power to strike a new balance in
                        international economic affairs</p>
                    <p>The new balance of which I speak does not confine itself to the concepts of a
                        balance of trade or a balance of payments. The world needs a new balance
                        between flexibility and stability in its basic approach to doing business.
                        The world needs a new balance between a unity of purpose and a diversity of
                        execution that will permit nations to cooperate closely without losing their
                        individuality or sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>We lack that balance today. Success in the negotiations in which we are
                        engaged will be measured in terms of how well we are able to achieve that
                        balance in the future.</p>
                    <p>I anticipate working closely and intensively with you to that end, shaping
                        and reshaping the best of our thinking as we proceed in full recognition
                        that the legitimate requirements of each nation must be meshed into a
                        harmonious whole.</p>
                    <p>In that spirit, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has
                        asked me to put certain ideas before you.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Drawing from this interchange of views, and building upon the Smithsonian

                        monetary arrangements that will serve us all in the decades ahead. Indeed, I
                        believe certain principles underlying monetary reform already command
                        widespread support.</p>
                    <p>First is our mutual interest in encouraging freer trade in goods and services
                        and the flow of capital to the places where it can contribute most to
                        economic growth. We must avoid a breakup of the world into antagonistic
                        blocs. We must not seek a refuge from our problems behind walls of
                        protectionism.</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of the common welfare through more open trade is threatened by an
                        ancient and recurring fallacy: Surpluses in payments are too often regarded
                        as a symbol of success and of good management rather than as a measure of
                        the goods and services provided from a nation's output without current
                        return.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize, of course, that freer trade must be reconciled with the
                        need for each country to avoid abrupt change involving serious disruptions
                        of production and employment. We must aim to expand productive employment in
                        all countries—and not at one another's expense.</p>
                    <p>A second fundamental is the need to develop a common code of conduct to
                        protect and strengthen the fabric of a free and open international economic
                        order.</p>
                    <p>Such basic rules as “no competitive devaluation” and “most-favored-nation
                        treatment” have served us well, but they and others need to be reaffirmed,
                        supplemented, and made applicable to today's conditions. Without such rules
                        to guide us, close and fruitful cooperation on a day-to-day basis would not
                        be possible.</p>
                    <p>Third, in shaping these rules we must recognize the need for clear
                        disciplines and standards of behavior to guide the international adjustment
                        process—a crucial gap in the Bretton Woods system. Amid the debate about the
                        contributing causes of past imbalances and the responsibility for initiative
                        toward correction, sight has too often been lost of the fact that adjustment
                        is inherently a two-sided process—that for the world as a whole, every
                        surplus is matched by a deficit.</p>
                    <p>Resistance of surplus countries to loss of their surpluses defeats the
                        objective of monetary order as surely as failure of deficit countries to
                        attack the source of their deficits. Any effort to develop a balanced and
                            <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0440"/>equitable monetary system must
                        recognize that simple fact; effective and symmetrical incentives for
                        adjustment are essential to a lasting system.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, while insisting on the need for adjustment, we can and should leave
                        considerable flexibility to national governments in their choice among
                        adjustment instruments. In a diverse world, equal responsibility and equal
                        opportunity need not mean rigid uniformity in particular practices. But they
                        do mean a common commitment to agreed international objectives. The belief
                        is widespread—and we share it—that the exchange rate system must be more
                        flexible. However, important as they are, exchange rates are not the only
                        instrument of adjustment policy available; nor in specific instances will
                        they necessarily be the most desirable.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, our monetary and trading systems are an interrelated complex. As we
                        seek to reform monetary rules, we must at the same time seek to build in
                        incentives for trade liberalization. Certainly, as we look ahead, ways must
                        be found to integrate better the work of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.
                        Simultaneously we should insure that there are pressures which move us
                        toward adequate development assistance and away from controls which stifle
                        the free flow of investment.</p>
                    <p>Finally, and perhaps most fundamental, any stable and well-functioning
                        international monetary system must rest upon sound policies to promote
                        domestic growth and price stability in the major countries. These are
                        imperative national goals for my government—and for yours. And no matter how
                        well we design an international system, its prospects for survival will be
                        doubtful without effective discharge of those responsibilities.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Cooperation for Equilibrium</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am fully aware that the United States as well as other countries cannot
                        leap into new monetary and trading arrangements without a transitional
                        period. I can state, however, that after such transitional period the United
                        States would be prepared to undertake an obligation to convert official
                        foreign dollar holdings into other reserve assets as a part of a
                        satisfactory system such as I have suggested—a system assuring effective and
                        equitable operation of the adjustment process. That decision will of course
                        need to rest on our reaching a demonstrated capacity during the transitional
                        period to meet the obligation in terms of our reserve and balance of
                        payments position.</p>
                    <p>We fully recognize that we have not yet reached the strength we need in our
                        external accounts. In the end, there can be no substitute for such strength
                        in providing the underpinning for a stable dollar and a stable monetary
                        system.</p>
                    <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0441"/>
                    <p>An acceptable monetary system requires a willingness on the part of all of us
                        to contribute to the common goal of full international equilibrium. Lacking
                        such equilibrium, no system will work. The equilibrium cannot be achieved by
                        any one country acting alone.</p>
                    <p>We engage in discussions on trade and financial matters with a full
                        realization of the necessity to continue our own efforts on a broad front to
                        restore our balance of payments. I must add, in all candor, that our efforts
                        to improve our position have in more than one instance been thwarted by the
                        reluctance of others to give up an unjustified preferential and highly
                        protected market position. Yet without success in our endeavor, we cannot
                        maintain our desired share in the provision of aid and reduce our official
                        debt to foreign monetary authorities.</p>
                    <p>We take considerable pride in our progress toward price stability, improved
                        productivity, and more rapid growth during the past year. Sustained into the
                        future, as it must be, that record will be the best possible medicine not
                        only for our domestic prosperity but for the effective functioning of the
                        international financial system.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Good afternoon:</p>
                    <p>Through the long years of America's involvement in Vietnam, our people's
                        yearning for peace has largely been focused on winning an end to that
                        difficult war. As a result, there has often been a tendency to lose sight of
                        the larger prospects for peace in the rest of the world. As peace in Vietnam
                        comes closer, we can look to the larger world and the long-term future with

                            xml:id="pg_422" facs="0442"/>our own strength and work to restore that
                        of our alliances, because the way to make real progress toward peace is to
                        negotiate from strength and not from weakness. Because we have done so, the
                        world today is more peaceful by far than it was 4 years ago. The prospects
                        for a full generation of peace are brighter than at any time since the end
                        of World War II.</p>
                    <p>In the past 4 years, we have concluded more—and more significant—agreements
                        with the Soviets than in all the previous years since World War II. We have
                        ended nearly a quarter century of mutual isolation between the United States
                        and the People's Republic of China. All over the world, the tide toward
                        negotiation is moving. North and South Korea are negotiating with one
                        another. East and West Germany are negotiating with one another. A
                        cease-fire has been in effect for more than 2 years in the Middle East. The
                        leaders of India and Pakistan are talking with one another. The nations of
                        Europe, of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and of the Warsaw Pact are
                        preparing to meet next year in a European Security Conference, and
                        preparations are underway for negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction
                        of armed forces in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>All this is evidence of solid progress toward a world in which we can talk
                        about our differences rather than fight about them.</p>
                    <p>Nineteen hundred seventy-two has been a year of more achievement for peace
                        than any year since the end of World War II. This progress did not just
                        happen by itself.</p>
                    <p>In my Inaugural Address nearly 4 years ago, I said that the greatest honor
                        history can bestow is the title of peacemaker, but I also pointed out that
                        peace does not come through wishing for it, that there is no substitute for
                        days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>For the past 4 years this Nation has engaged in patient and prolonged
                        diplomacy in every corner of the world, and we have also maintained the
                        strength that has made our diplomacy credible and peace possible. As a
                        result, we are well on the way toward erecting what I have often referred to
                        as a structure of peace, a structure that rests on the hard concrete of
                        common interests and mutual agreements, and not on the shifting sands of
                        naive sentimentality.</p>
                    <p>That term, “a structure of peace,” speaks an important truth about the nature
                        of peace in today's world. Peace cannot be wished into being. It has to be
                        carefully and painstakingly built in many ways and on many fronts, through
                        networks of alliances, through respect for commitments, through patient
                        negotiations, through balancing military forces and expanding economic
                        interdependence, through reaching one agreement that opens the way to
                        others, through developing patterns of international behavior that will be
                        accepted by other powers. Most <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0443"
                        />important of all, the structure of peace has to be built in such a way
                        that all those who might be tempted to destroy it will instead have a stake
                        in preserving it.</p>
                    <p>In the past 4 years, my efforts to build that structure of peace have taken
                        me to 22 countries, including four world capitals never visited by an
                        American President before—Peking, Moscow, Warsaw, and Bucharest. Everywhere
                        I have traveled I have seen evidence that the times are on the side of
                        peace, if America maintains its strength and continues on course. For
                        example, ever since World War II, the world's people and its statesmen have
                        dreamed of putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle, of controlling the
                        dreaded nuclear arms race, but always that race remained unchecked until
                        this year.</p>
                    <p>In Moscow last May, we and the Soviet Union reached the first agreement ever
                        for limiting strategic nuclear arms. We signed that agreement last month in
                        Washington. This was an historic beginning. It moved back the frontiers of
                        fear. It helped check the dangerous spiral of nuclear weapons. It opened the
                        way to further negotiations on further limitations on nuclear arsenals which
                        will soon begin.</p>
                    <p>As we pursue these negotiations, however, let us remember that no country
                        will pay a price for something that another country will give up for
                        nothing. If we had scrapped the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> missile
                        system, as many advocated, we would never have achieved the first arms
                        agreement with the Soviets. If we unilaterally slashed our defenses now as
                        our opponents in this election advocate, the Soviets would have no incentive
                        to negotiate further arms limitations.</p>
                    <p>Or take another example. After 10 years of recurring international monetary
                        crises, we took bold actions a year ago to strengthen the dollar and to
                        bring about a reformed international monetary system that would be fair to
                        the United States and fair to the world. The result of these actions has
                        been a solid and substantial beginning on just such a system, and the stage
                        is now set for an international effort to achieve some of the most important
                        monetary and trade reforms in history. As we complete these reforms in the
                        years ahead, we can usher in a new age of world prosperity, a prosperity
                        made even greater by the rapid expansion of peaceful trade that is now
                        taking place, not only with our traditional trading partners but also with
                        nations that have been our adversaries.</p>
                    <p>I cite these simply as examples of the broad, unfinished agenda of peace that
                        now lies before us, the agenda of new starts made, of negotiations begun, of
                        new relationships established, which now we must build on with the same
                        initiative and imagination that achieved the initial breakthroughs. As we
                        move forward on this agenda, we can see vast areas of peaceful cooperation
                        to be explored.</p>
                    <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0444"/>
                    <p>We agreed in Peking to pursue cultural, journalistic, educational, and other
                        exchanges, so that the world's most prosperous nation and its most populous
                        nation can get to know one another again.</p>
                    <p>We agreed in Moscow to cooperate in protecting the environment, explore in
                        space, fight disease. This means the day is fast approaching when a Russian
                        cosmonaut and an American astronaut will shake hands in space, when a
                        Russian chemist and an American biologist will work side by side to find a
                        cure for cancer. And each time our nations join hands in the works of peace,
                        we advance the day when nations will no longer raise their hands in
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the world today America is respected. This is partly because we
                        have entered a new era of initiative in American foreign policy, and the
                        world's leaders and its people have seen the results. But it is also because
                        the world has come to know America. It knows we are a nation of peaceful
                        intentions, of honorable purposes, true to our commitments. We are respected
                        because for a third of a century under six Presidents we have met the
                        responsibilities of a great and free nation. We have not retreated from the
                        world. We have not betrayed our allies. We have not fallen into the foolish
                        illusion that we could somehow build a wall around America, here to enjoy
                        our comforts, oblivious to the cries or the threats of others. We have
                        maintained our strength.</p>
                    <p>There are those today who condemn as a relic of a cold war mentality the idea
                        that peace requires strength. There are those who ridicule military
                        expenditures as wasteful and immoral. Our opponents in this campaign have
                        even described the great bipartisan tradition of negotiating from strength
                        as one of the most damaging and costly clichés in the American vocabulary.
                        If the day ever comes when the President of the United States has to
                        negotiate from weakness, that will be a dangerous day, not only for America
                        but for the whole world.</p>
                    <p>Those who scoff at balance of power diplomacy should recognize that the only
                        alternative to a balance of power is an imbalance of power, and history
                        shows that nothing so drastically escalates the danger of war as such an
                        imbalance. It is precisely the fact that the elements of balance now exist
                        that gives us a rare opportunity to create a system of stability that can
                        maintain the peace, not just for a decade but for a generation and more.</p>
                    <p>The years ahead will not be easy. The choices will not be simple. They will
                        require an extra measure of care in distinguishing between rhetoric and
                        reality, between the easy temptation and the hard necessity. We will be told
                        that all the things we want to do at home could be painlessly financed if we
                        slashed our military spending. We will be told that we can have peace merely
                        by asking for it, that if we simply <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0445"
                        />demonstrate good will and good faith, our adversaries will do likewise,
                        and that we need do no more. This is dangerous nonsense.</p>
                    <p>A heavy responsibility lies on the shoulders of those who hold or seek power
                        in today's world, a responsibility not to court the public favor by
                        fostering illusions that peace can be either achieved or kept without
                        maintaining our strength and meeting our responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>As we approach the end of the war in Vietnam, the great question is whether
                        the end of that war will be only an interlude between wars or the beginning
                        of a generation of peace for the world.</p>
                    <p>Five months ago, I delivered the first television address to the Soviet
                        people ever made by an American President. I tried to tell them something
                        about America, about the people of America, about our hopes, our desire for
                        peace and progress, not only for ourselves but for all the people of the
                        world. In that talk, I repeated an old story told in Russia about a traveler
                        who was walking to another village, who stopped and asked a woodsman how
                        long it would take him to get there. The woodsman replied he did not know.
                        The traveler was angry, because he was sure the woodsman lived in the
                        village and knew how far it was. But then as soon as he had gone a few steps
                        further down the road, the woodsman called out to him to stop. “It will take
                        you 15 minutes,” the woodsman said. “Why didn't you tell me that in the
                        first place?” the traveler demanded. And the woodsman answered, “Because
                        then I didn't know the length of your stride.”</p>
                    <p>In these past 4 years, we and the other nations of the world have had a
                        chance to measure the length of our strides. At last we are traveling in the
                        same direction toward a world of peace, toward an era of negotiation, and of
                        expanding cooperation. In the next 4 years, the President of the United
                        States, whoever he is, will negotiate with the leaders of many nations on a
                        broad range of issues vital to America, vital to the world. As we cast our
                        ballots next Tuesday, the world will see whether we have changed the length
                        of our stride.</p>
                    <p>If you approve the beginnings we have made, then your vote on election day to
                        support those policies will be a message to the leaders of all other nations
                        that the American people are not going to retreat, are not going to
                        surrender. It will strengthen the President's hand immensely as we continue
                        to move from confrontation to negotiation to cooperation all around the
                        world as we build toward a generation of peace.</p>
