                        Volume E–5, Part 2</ref>, Documents on North Africa, 1969-1972. This
                    electronic-only volume is available on the Department of State's website. Part
                    of the ongoing official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy, this is the
                    promised second portion of an electronic-only volume that in two parts covers
                    Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, 1969-1972. The first part on Sub-Saharan
                    African has been on the Department's website since October 2005. The portion
                    released today presents the record of U.S. policies towards North Africa.
                    Documentation on U.S. policy towards Southern Africa, 1969-1976, is scheduled
                    for later publication in <ref target="frus1969-76v28">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, volume
                    XXVIII</ref>.</p>
                <p>The volume has a chapter on general U.S. policy towards the region, which
                    demonstrates that U.S. analysts concluded that North Africa would remain
                    politically stable, with the possible exception of Libya, where a successful
                    coup by young military officers overthrew the monarchy. Still, the analysts
                    assured the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration that by
                    actively engaging the countries of North Africa and by encouraging the United
                    States European allies to do the same, the area could be kept free of Soviet
                    domination.</p>
                <p>The documents on Algeria reflect the role of U.S. influence, rather than active
                    diplomacy, since the radical government of Algeria had earlier broken relations
                    with the United States over its Middle East and Vietnam polices. While U.S.
                    political relations with Algeria were limited, commercial relations saw steady
                    improvement. Algeria's willingness to give safe haven to terrorist and dissident
                    groups, like the Black Panthers, did nothing to improve U.S.-Algerian diplomatic
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Libya was the country with the most potential for problems, but the new military
                    government moved slowly. Eventually it negotiated with Washington the
                    termination of the Wheelus Air Force Base agreement. The primary issue for
                    Tripoli was the delivery of U.S. jet aircraft, which the United States had
                    contracted to sell to the previous Libyan Government. The chapter covers
                    deliberations in Washington over this issue: would the sale of aircraft
                    antagonize Israel and result in more arms requests from them? Could the sale
                    prevent potential Libyan nationalization of American and European oil companies?
                    In the end, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                    concluded that the sale would neither appreciably worsen, nor improve, relations
                    with Tripoli, and denied delivery. The Libyan reaction was sharp, with threats
                    to go to the Soviet Union for weapons; however, U.S.-Libyan relations continued
                    on a reduced, but still workable level.</p>
                <p>Morocco under King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> was a strong
                    ally of the United States and a moderate voice in the Arab-Israeli dispute;
                    however, the documents in this chapter demonstrate that nonetheless there were
                    still tensions. Unsuccessful coups and calls in Morocco for political reform of
                    the royal government caused both <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration to look
                    again at their relationship. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    agreed to broaden his government, but warned that this could have repercussions
                    for the United States. In order to continue friendly relations with Morocco and
                    to support <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, the United States
                    agreed to be more responsive to his needs and to reduce the U.S. military
                    presence in Morocco. Far from U.S. disengagement, this measure was designed to
                    preserve relations.</p>
                <p>Tunisia under President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> was
                    perhaps America's closest ally in North Africa, but <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                        >Bourguiba</persName> was ill and nearing retirement. The sale of Soviet
                    arms to Algeria and the Libyan coup increased Tunisia's sense of insecurity, but
                    the United States was only prepared to provide a modest increase in military
                    assistance and rhetorical support in the form of assurances from President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Even Tunisia clashed verbally
                    with U.S. officials over U.S. support for Israel; however, the overall
                    relationship between the two countries remained strong.</p>
                <p>This volume relies on documentation generated by the Assistant to the President
                    for National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff, and the

                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>Early in President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>'s first
                    term, officials monitoring U.S.-North African relations had grounds for some
                    satisfaction. U.S. ties with Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya were firm. Although
                    Algeria had not yet resumed diplomatic relations broken during the 1967
                    Arab-Israeli war, its economic links with the United States were expanding. Yet
                    for all North African governments, friendly or otherwise, the Arab-Israeli issue
                    complicated relations with Washington. The conflict was a major factor in
                    continuing Algerian resistance to reestablishing formal ties with Washington. In
                    Libya, a military junta, pledging internal reform and espousing Arab nationalism
                    and the Palestinian cause, overthrew the unpopular pro-western monarchy in
                    September 1969. Thereafter, the administration's concern over Israeli
                    sensibilities influenced its decision not to fulfill its aircraft contract with
                    the Libyan government, to the detriment of U.S.-Libyan relations. In Morocco,
                    Washington was allied with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>,
                    partly for his “moderate” stand on issues like the Arab-Israeli question. Yet as
                        <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> moved Morocco towards more
                    representative government, he warned that Morocco's firm support for the United
                    States could change. Even Tunisia, a staunch U.S. ally, pushed Washington for a
                    more energetic pursuit of Middle East peace, but was disappointed.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">North Africa: General</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The challenge for the North African states was to forge beneficial relations with
                    the United States, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and France, while
                    still maintaining their independence. Washington's support of Israel, however,
                    strained North African-U.S. relations. Regional governments pressed the United
                    States to resolve the Middle East crisis and attempted to defuse the issue
                    themselves. In 1969, Morocco hosted two conferences, one Islamic and one Arab,
                    in an attempt to seize the initiative on the Middle East from Arab “radicals”
                    and bolster its fellow “moderates.” Arab nationalists took heart from the Libyan
                    coup in September 1969, and it prompted U.S. officials to reexamine trends and
                    options in North Africa in January 1970.</p>
                <p>U.S. analysts concluded that Algeria and Morocco were likely to remain
                    politically stable in the near future, in the latter case due to King <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s tight grip on power. However, in
                    Tunisia, where the ailing President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                        >Bourguiba</persName> was likely to step down, and Libya, where an
                    inexperienced military junta ruled, the reports predicted political turmoil.
                    Still, without a major Arab-Israel war or western disengagement, analysts saw no
                    significant likelihood of Soviet dominance of the area. The National Security
                    Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) Interdepartmental Group agreed in
                    1970 that, to maintain its regional interests, the United States should continue
                    an active relationship with all North African governments, but also welcome a
                    Western European presence. Since U.S. influence was limited by Washington's
                    close identification with Israel, Western Europe, particularly France, could
                    provide the counterpoise to the Soviets in North Africa.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Algeria</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Although U.S.-Algerian commercial ties were steadily improving by 1969, tensions
                    between the two countries remained. Some U.S. analysts speculated that while
                    Algeria maintained ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France,
                    and U.S. companies, ultimately it might lean toward Moscow. Others trusted
                    Algeria's ability to play the big powers off against each other while retaining
                    its independence. To Algiers, Washington's war in Vietnam and pro-Israeli stance
                    posed barriers to the re-establishment of official relations. Yet Algiers also
                    placed high priority on internal economic development and in 1970 sought help
                    from the U.S. government in financing a joint U.S.-Algerian liquefied natural
                    gas project.</p>
                <p>In the belief that improved commercial relations could lead to renewed diplomatic
                    ties, the administration allowed the importation of Algerian natural gas in
                    1971, despite French opposition. In 1972, Washington approved a U.S. firm's sale
                    of an air defense network to Algiers. With U.S. encouragement, Algeria upgraded
                    the status of its representative at the Algerian Interests Section in Washington
                    in 1970, and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> periodically
                    corresponded with President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Houari
                        Boumedienne</persName>. Yet Algeria resisted U.S. pressure to resume
                    diplomatic relations, arguing that Washington had made too little progress in
                    resolving the Arab-Israeli crisis. Washington, meanwhile, grew exasperated at
                    Algiers for giving safe haven to groups the United States regarded as terrorist
                    and dissident, such as the Black Panthers, who staged dramatic hijackings of
                    U.S. aircraft in 1972. This issue joined Vietnam and the Middle East as matters
                    hindering the reestablishment of U.S.-Algerian relations in this period.</p>

                <p>U.S. officials recognized that the authoritarian and corrupt monarchy of King
                    Idris had an uncertain future, and attempted to distance themselves from a U.S.
                    commitment to the succession of Idris' son. On September 1, 1969, a group of
                    little known young military officers staged a coup and set up a new government,
                    the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>), which
                    the United States warily recognized. Although its initial statements were
                    measured, the new government was, according to <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> analysts, unlikely to remain so, and would probably insist on
                    U.S. withdrawal from Wheelus Airforce Base. In October 1969, Tripoli requested
                    discussions to terminate the U.S. presence. To protect U.S. interests,
                    particularly oil, Washington agreed to withdraw in mid-1970 from Wheelus.</p>
                <p>When Morocco and Tunisia expressed concern at U.S. failure to restore the Libyan
                    monarchy, Washington disavowed the right to save governments from internal
                    threats. More to the point, as internal studies indicated, Washington had
                    limited leverage and at best could work with, and try to influence, the new
                    regime. Contrary to Libyan suspicions, the United States denied involvement in
                    the attempted countercoup against the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> in
                    December 1969, and even helped thwart several later coup attempts by Libyan
                    exiles. A functioning U.S.-Libyan relationship seemed possible.</p>
                <p>To Tripoli, however, the great test of U.S.-Libyan relations was the eight F-5
                    aircraft which the United States had contracted to sell to the previous regime.
                    When the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> demanded delivery, the United
                    States deferred a decision, pending a clearer picture of Libyan developments.
                    The arming of Libya, some U.S. officials argued, would antagonize Israel, which
                    might itself demand more aircraft and further destabilize the region. To some in
                    the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> the United States was too pro-Israeli to
                    be a partner. <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_QM1">Mu'ammer Qadhafi</persName>, noting Tripoli's profound
                    concern with the plight of the Palestinians, warned that the United States would
                    lose the Arabs because of its commitment to Israel. In mid-1970, irritated at
                    the delays from western military suppliers, Libya accepted its first arms
                    delivery from the Soviet Union, while avowing its intention of maintaining its
                    independence and non-alignment.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as negotiations between the Libyans and the oil industry intensified,
                    the United States concluded correctly that although Libya would bargain hard for
                    better terms, perhaps including 51% control of oil companies, outright
                    nationalization of the oil industry was unlikely. Secretary of Defense <persName
                        corresp="#p_LMR1">Melvin Laird</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                        corresp="#p_PJAII1">Joseph Palmer</persName> believed that Washington should
                    make some effort to accommodate the Libyans on the question of the F-5 sales,
                    which Deputy Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">John
                        Irwin</persName> argued could protect U.S. oil investments. The President's
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName> vacillated on the question, initially accepting that no
                    gesture would make the Libyan government less hostile and later agreeing to
                    consider releasing the F-5s in order to protect the oil companies. But in the
                    end <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> sided with Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName>, who asserted that
                    the refusal to sell had not appreciably damaged relations and that the sale
                    would provide no security to the oil companies. The United States continued to
                    refuse to provide new weapons to Libya, without saying so explicitly.</p>
                <p>Libya did not nationalize any U.S. companies but in May 1972, it requested a
                    reduction in the size of the U.S. embasy from thirty-five to fourteen. In
                    October, the Libyan Foreign Minister called the failure of the United States to
                    fulfill the F-5 contract the major problem in U.S.-Libyan bilateral relations.
                    Moreover, Qadhafi sent word through the Ambassador that, due to Washington's
                    refusal to deliver arms to Libya while opening its arsenal to Israel, Tripoli
                    could now be forced to turn to Moscow with more regularity. By December, the
                    Embassy warned that, due to its support for Israel, the United States could
                    expect a new policy of overt discrimination against its interests, and
                    recommended that Washington remove “unnecessary misunderstandings in the area of
                    arms supply.” No change was forthcoming, however, in Washington's policy of
                    deferring the F-5 question.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Morocco:</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Although U.S.-Moroccan relations in 1969 were generally sound, the Arab-Israeli
                    crisis put pressure on King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> to
                    lean more towards neutralism and to be more receptive to Soviet overtures.
                    Following the Libyan coup, however, the regime became uneasy at the prospects
                    for regional subversion by hard-line pro-Palestinian elements, and urged the
                    United States to expand its influence in the Maghreb. In his conferences that
                    year, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> tried to preempt
                    “radical” elements under the leadership of Iraq and Egypt and to forge a
                    “moderate” consensus on the Arab-Israeli issue. When Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> visited Morocco in
                    February 1970, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> pressed the
                    Washington to impose peace on the Middle East to avoid further upheaval and
                    Soviet infiltration. In June, the King sent a special envoy to Washington at
                    Egyptian President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Gamal Abdel Nasser</persName>'s
                    request to emphasize the seriousness of Egypt's peace appeal. The United States,
                    the envoy urged, should cease arms deliveries to Israel and force it to accept
                    the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council settlement. Yet while the
                    President was eager to support the “moderates” and show willingness for peace,
                    he viewed Soviet influence on Egypt, not Israel, as the great obstacle to
                    settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
                <p>In response to critics, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    proposed in July 1970 to end a five-year “state of exception” by drafting a
                    constitution and restoring parliament. These reforms were mostly cosmetic,
                    however, and <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> retained his royal
                    power. He also hoped to use the controversial U.S. military facilities at
                    Kenitra, nominally under Moroccan control, as a lever for greater U.S.
                    assistance. When a Senate subcommittee referred to the facilities as a “U.S.
                    base,” Rabat seized on the language to demand a higher “counterpart.” Privately,
                    the administration concluded that the United States should attempt to retain
                    access to the Kenitra facilities as long as the political and economic costs
                    were not insurmountable for either Rabat or Washington. Yet while prepared to
                    increase aid, Washington was determined to avoid a quid pro quo for Kenitra.</p>
                <p>In July 1971, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> survived a coup
                    attempt by disaffected military officers. U.S. analysts observed that <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s lifestyle and concentration of power
                    placed the King in danger of popular revolt. In the aftermath of the uprising,
                    the King determined to coordinate more fully with Washington, even as the
                    administration hoped to avoid too close an identification with his government.
                    In August 1972, another group of military officers made an unsuccessful attempt
                    on the King's life. By underscoring <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                        >Hassan</persName>'s shaky prospects, the attack prompted U.S. officials to
                    reconsider policy toward Morocco, including perhaps reducing the U.S. military
                    presence. Given the King's reluctance to reform, analysts speculated, another
                    plot against him was likely to succeed. For his part, <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> incorrectly suspected that the United
                    States had been involved in the plot. As he pledged to broaden his government,
                        <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> warned that the opposition
                    would demand that Morocco assume more control of U.S. bases, consolidate them,
                    and extract higher rent. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>'s Senior Review
                    Group concluded that since friendly relations with Morocco were important and
                    the King was still the focal point of authority, the United States should be
                    responsive to his needs and reduce its military presence. Far from disengaging
                    from the King, this maneuver was designed to preserve U.S. relations with his
                    government.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft">
                    <hi rend="italic">Tunisia:</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One of the poorest North African countries, Tunisia was also probably
                    Washington's closest ally in the region. U.S. officials believed that long-time
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> would shortly
                    retire, and that his unnamed successor was unlikely to be so pro-western. Yet
                    while recognizing that <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> was
                    personally responsible for the warmth of U.S.-Tunisian relations, the
                    administration judged that Tunisia would continue to maintain strong links with
                    Washington. In late 1970, when <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                    was diagnosed with arterial brain damage, the administration arranged for the
                    President's medical treatment in Washington.</p>
                <p>The United States saw no need to offer much incentive for Tunisia's loyalty
                    beyond rhetorical support. In 1969, Tunis pressed Washington unsuccessfully for
                    a more comprehensive military aid package to offset the threat from Moscow and
                    Soviet-armed Algiers, and to show the benefits of the U.S. alliance. The Libyan
                    coup only increased Tunisia's sense of insecurity. U.S. officials believed
                    Tunis's fears were exaggerated, although President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> voiced personal sympathy for their concerns. When other
                    exigencies forced the United States to make reductions in assistance to Tunisia
                    in 1970, officials were careful to declare U.S. interest in Tunisian security,
                    which “represented the extent to which we have been willing to go in response to
                    Tunisia's request for a special security relationship with the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>Together with military assistance, another persistent issue in U.S.-Tunisian
                    relations was the conflict in the Middle East. During the Secretary of State's
                    February 1970 trip to North Africa, Rogers found the Tunisians preoccupied by
                    the Palestinian crisis. Under new Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                        >MOHAMED MASMOUDI</persName>, U.S. analysts reported, Tunisia was bringing
                    its policy more into line with that of the “radical” Arabs. In meetings with
                    U.S. officials that autumn, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>
                    emphasized the importance of U.S. pressure on Israel to achieve a Middle East
                    settlement, and of greater military aid to Tunisia. Both of these steps, the
                    Foreign Minister emphasized, would help to keep the Soviets at bay. On the
                    Arab-Israeli issue, there was little progress. In late 1972, <persName
                        corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> confronted the U.S. Ambassador to the
                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, accusing the United States of writing off
                    the Palestinians and becoming wedded to the Israelis, leaving Washington's Arab
                    friends in an untenable position.</p>
                <p>On the military front, Washington attempted to be somewhat more responsive. In
                    1971, Washington added a modest $1 million to the $3 million military assistance
                    program for Tunisia, with a renewed assurance of the President's concern.
                    However, the administration declined Tunis's 1972 request for additional
                    internal security aid, softening the rejection with more development assistance.
                    Concerned that Tunisia was undervalued by the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJA1"
                        >John Calhoun</persName> urged the administration to preserve the present
                    relationship by maintaining U.S. programs and agreeing to <persName
                        corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s request for a high-level review of
                    U.S.-Tunisian relations. In December 1972, however, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> responded to the request with his standard device by again
                    reassuring <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> of the United States'
                    interest in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>The combined effect of the documentation presented in this volume indicates that
                    while North Africa was important enough for the United States to wish to retain
                    the region in the western camp and prevent inroads into the area by the Soviet
                    Union or Arab radicals, North Africa was not a priority for U.S. foreign policy
                    under President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Therefore, North
                    African demands for changes in U.S. policy towards Israel and the Israeli-Arab
                    crisis, or increased military aid or sales generally, received political but
                    basically non-committal responses from Washington.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName
                        corresp="#p_BGHW1">George H. W. Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991,
                    established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching

                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in a new format,
                    that of electronic-only publication. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes
                    scheduled for publication for the 1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName

                    administrations, will be in this format. The decision to institute this change
                    was taken in full consultation with the Department's Advisory Committee on
                    Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established under the Foreign
                    Relations statute. The advantages of this new method of presenting documentation
                    are evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access to more key
                    documentation on a broader range of issues, all or any portion of which can be
                    easily downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is
                    still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volume. This electronic-only publication results in
                    substantial savings in cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to
                    present a fuller range of documentation, on a wider range of topics, sooner than
                    would have been possible under a print-only format. These advantages compensate
                    for the fact that this <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an
                    actual book bound in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the
                    Historian, the General Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all
                    dedicated to publishing the great majority of the volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also
                    posted in electronic format on the Department of State's website. While the
                    future of research in documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease
                    of use and availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue
                    to use both print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In
                    that sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the
                    series begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by
                    subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140 years.</p>

                    Southern Africa, 1969-1976. This volume does not attempt to cover all countries
                    in sub-Saharan or North Africa, but instead concentrates on those areas where
                    U.S. interests and concerns were greatest. The chapters on general U.S. policy
                    toward Africa and North Africa provide the widest scope of coverage.</p>
                <p>The largest chapter, comprising more than half the sub-Saharan section of the
                    volume, documents the Nigeria civil war and its aftermath. While the United
                    States did not recognize the rebellion in Biafra and followed a policy of
                    non-intervention, it was heavily involved in providing humanitarian relief
                    mainly through the International Committee of the Red Cross and Joint Church
                    Aid. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> appointed a Special
                    Coordinator on Relief to Civilian Victims of the Nigerian Civil War to provide
                    guidance and direction to relief operations and to deflect some of the domestic
                    criticism of the U.S. policy of non-intervention. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> himself was sympathetic to Biafran aspirations and the
                    suffering caused by the civil war, and complained about, but did not to change,
                    the Department of State policy of refusing to recognize Biafra as a
                    belligerent.</p>
                <p>The second great humanitarian crisis covered by the volume relates to the 1972
                    massacres of Hutus by Tutsis in Burundi. Again the Department of State followed
                    a low-key, non-intervention policy and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration did not make any effort to prevent the
                    brutality and massacres beyond again expressing private dismay.</p>
                <p>Chapters on Congo and the Horn of Africa highlight the growing U.S relationship
                    with President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> of Zaire
                    and Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> of Ethiopia as
                    the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration attempted to
                    create strong, pro-American governments in those two key African countries,
                    especially through military assistance and sales of military equipment. On the
                    other hand, in the Horn of Africa chapter, the volume documents the
                    deterioration of U.S. relations with the Somali Republic and the virtual
                    breakdown of U.S. relations with Uganda under the erratic leadership of
                    President Idi Amin is documented in the Uganda chapter.</p>
                <p>There are four chapters on U.S. bilateral relations with North Africa—Algeria,
                    Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Algeria and Libya, the United States faced
                    radical governments with strong pro-Palestinian leanings. Algeria did not have
                    diplomatic relations with the United States, but commercial and economic ties
                    remained strong. The overthrow of the Libyan monarchy in September 1969 by young
                    military officers forced the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    Administration to reconsider its relationship with Libya. The documentary
                    records indicates that in the end the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration decided to maintained diplomatic relations
                    with Libya and use its economic connections in the hopes of influencing the new
                    military government towards a more pro-Western stance. The documentation on
                    relations with staunch U.S. allies Morocco and Tunisia are highlighted by
                    high-level visits of leaders, mutual assurances of support, and military aid. In
                    all four chapters, there is documentation indicates that each of these
                    governments, in its own way, attempted to influence the United States to
                    pressure Israel towards a Middle East settlement conducive to Palestinian
                    interests.</p>

                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the

                        Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines,
                    supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the
                    Declassification and Publishing Division. The original text is reproduced
                    exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the
                    facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note. There is also a
                    text version of the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary,
                    and a source note with additional relevant information, as required, for each
                    document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are
                    retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors
                    are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations, persons, and
                    sources accompanies the volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text
                    file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is
                    blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type)
                    appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld
                    because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source

                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The final declassification
                    review of this volume, which began in 2000 and was completed in 2005, resulted
                    in the decision to withhold 4 (this might change if any N. Afr. denials)
                    documents in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 9 (plus N. Afr. excisions) X
                    documents, and to make minor excisions in 22 (plus N. Afr excisions) documents.
                    The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing
                    this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described
                    above, that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the first
                    Nixon administration toward sub-Saharan and North Africa between 1969 and
                    1972.</p>

                        system is divided into broad categories: Administration, Consular, Culture
                        and Information, Economic, Political and Defense, Science, and Social.
                        Within each of these divisions are subject subcategories. For example,
                        Political and Defense contains four subtopics: <gloss target="#t_POL1"
                            >POL</gloss> (Politics), DEF (Defense), CSM (Communism), and INT
                        (Intelligence). Numerical subdivisions further define the subtopics. The

                        <p>Diplomatic activity in the Maghreb has quickened since the successful
                            visit in January of Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Houari
                                Boumediene</persName> to Morocco. “Non-alignment” is again the
                            watchword in Morocco and Algeria—although not yet in Tunisia or Libya.
                            While this new climate may place some limits on Soviet influence, it can
                            also have significant drawbacks for the US. But the enhanced stability
                            it provides an area important to US interests may be worth the
                            risks.</p>

                            in late 1965, Morocco has been seeking more diplomatic latitude. The

                            to supply $14 million in arms—induced Morocco to seek a more neutralist

                            At the same time, the Moroccans have been probing for an invitation for

                            his independence by bettering relations with his conservative neighbors.
                            To draw a rein on the Soviets, the Algerians have sought more French
                            military assistance and have agreed to a visit by French Foreign

                            Algerians on economic cooperation. Later, however, the Algerians
                            attempted to force through a quick border settlement, with the
                            predictable result that the Tunisians dug in their heels. Both Tunisia
                            and Libya have been seeking nonetheless to broaden their diplomatic
                            options. Tunisia has been moving ahead on its rapprochement with

                            neutralist influence in its foreign policy, Algeria has not shown a
                            corresponding interest in moving closer to the US or other Western
                            countries. Boumediene has recently branded the US Sixth Fleet—but not
                            the Soviet fleet—as “dangerous” to its independence. Even so, Algeria's
                            decision to improve relations with its neighbors probably constitutes a
                            significant contribution to stabilizing an area long torn by rivalries
                            and suspicions and in which the US retains important interests.</p>

                        <p>The Rabat meeting of 25 Moslem nations survived postponement attempts and
                            internal conflicts to become the first Islamic Summit Conference. Its
                            concluding declaration and resolutions represented a moderate consensus
                            and may have laid the groundwork for a Moslem bloc.</p>

                            success in itself. We agree that bringing together government leaders
                            (including 9 heads of state) representing about 300 <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d2-02" facs="d2-02"/>million Moslems was a major
                            achievement. It took considerable skill on the part of Hassan and
                            co-initiator King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to gain rapid agreement for
                            early scheduling of a summit and to persuade suspicious non-Arab Moslems
                            to participate in an Arab-dominated assembly. Less than a week before
                            opening day, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            launched a counteroffensive seeking to postpone the summit indefinitely.
                            In the end, his bluff was called and a UAR delegation was dispatched to
                            Rabat. Only Iraq and Syria of the “progressive” Arab group failed to
                            appear. A final crisis occurred in mid-summit, when a belated invitation
                            to India provoked a stormy Pakistani response and India's ouster. Even
                            this turbulent event, which might have broken up any other conference,
                            only prolonged the meeting an extra day.</p>

                            came a moderate consensus, despite radical Arab and Palestinian lobbying
                            (the Palestinian Liberation Organization—PLO—was given observer status
                            at the meeting). The official conference declaration, taking the al-Aqsa
                            mosque incident as point of departure, called for restoration of
                            Jerusalem's pre-June 1967 status and speedy withdrawal of Israeli
                            military forces from all territories occupied as a result of the 1967
                            war; it appealed to the US,<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss

                            the 1967 Security Council resolution. On Palestine, a solitary sentence
                            affirmed “full support to the Palestinian people for the restitution of
                            their rights” and in their “struggle for national liberation.”</p>
                        <p>The moderate Arab organizers can claim full credit for the language-a
                            compromise that reiterated basic Arab positions without offending

                            regret what might have been added, but can raise no serious objections

                        <p>The Makings of a Moslem Bloc? The Moderates undoubtedly hope that they
                            have strengthened the Arab cause in a potentially permanent fashion. The
                            conference declaration spoke of regular consultation and “close
                            cooperation and mutual assistance” among Mos1em states. In addition, the
                            principal resolution set a meeting of Islamic foreign ministers for
                            March 1970 at Jidda to review common action undertaken after the summit
                            and to establish an Islamic permanent secretariat. In sum, the moderates
                            can claim to have created a Moslem bloc to be formally organized next
                            March.</p>
                        <p>Arab moderates will use the success of the Islamic Summit to strengthen
                            their inter-Arab position and to argue against holding an Arab Summit,
                            to which Faisal is adamantly opposed. He fears it would be controlled by
                            radical states, who would call for increased financial contributions
                            from the oil-producers and would push through extreme resolutions. If
                            Faisal also hopes that the projected Moslem bloc will provide an
                            effective counter balance to radical domination of the Arab League, he
                            will probably be disappointed.</p>
                        <p>A consequence of the moderates' success was the absence of attack on the
                            US or “imperialism” in the final statements, However, it is virtually
                            certain that the radical Arab states will continue to agitate for a more
                            extreme political posture in the Islamic forum; unless <persName

                            stillbirth—for the Moslem bloc.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Fifth Arab Summit Conference at Rabat (December 21-23), which the
                            Arabs convened in high hopes and in an atmosphere relatively free of
                            inter-Arab bilateral disputes, came to an ignominious end in apparently
                            irreconcilable disagreement over the central issue of mobilization for
                            an eventual full-scale war with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Fawzi's Proposals Unacceptable to Some. The summit foundered on the first
                            agenda item—a three-year plan for mi1itary mobilization presented by UAR
                            War Minister Fawzi. In addition to heavy requirements for men and
                            material, the plan reportedly called for huge financial allocations for
                            arms by present financial contributors (Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) and
                            by other states (e.g., Algeria, Morocco) as well. The plan ran aground
                            because of the Iraqi and Syrian demands for an all-out war against
                            Israel now, attempts by the Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians to focus
                            Arab efforts on support for the Palestinians, and Saudi and Kuwaiti
                            unwillingness to increase their financial contributions. When Saudi
                            Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia were clearly unwilling to
                            commit themselves to the financial contributions envisioned by Fawzi's
                            plan, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> staged his walk-out
                            on December 23. The subsequent closed session failed to reach agreement;
                            militant Syria, Iraq, and Southern Yemen boycotted the brief closing
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Arab Disunity: A Mixed Blessing. The disunity at Rabat may push the
                            possibility of another Mideast war further into the future, but it
                            raises questions about the possibilities for peace, since it removes
                            some of the pressure for <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"
                            />compromise from Israel and may make it even more difficult for
                            individual Arab leaders to agree to a settlement. Furthermore, the
                            conference results may pose problems for the Arab states which opposed
                            the Fawzi plan, in the form of domestic discontent or of campaigns
                            mounted by Arab radicals. Cairo media have already blamed the conference
                            failure on states that “contended they could not offer more to the
                            battle.” It will not take long to discover whether we are on the verge
                            of a renewed “cold war” among the Arabs, or whether the UAR's need for a
                            continuation of the Khartoum subsidy payments will mute any major
                            propaganda-subversion campaigns. The overall impact of the negative
                            psychological reaction in the Arab world has not been felt yet.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may try to regain the
                            initiative at the UAR-Libya-Sudan summit scheduled for December 25 in
                            Tripoli. Though less likely, he has the option of using the Rabat
                            meeting's failure to endorse war preparations as justification for
                            renewed UAR attention to a political settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Fedayeen. Because of the conference's disorderly end, the remaining
                            agenda items—support for the fedayeen and financial aid to Palestinians
                            in the occupied areas—were not resolved. As a result, the Palestinian
                            Liberation Organization apparently did not receive the collective Arab
                            political backing it had sought nor its anticipated subsidy of about $20
                            million per year, but it will probably get increased financial aid from
                            some Arab states, and the overall effect of the summit's collapse on the
                            guerrilla movement will probably be minor. Arafat apparently kept out of
                            the disputes, and Fatah's avowed goal of avoiding subordination to any
                            Arab state may be strengthened by the split at Rabat. The failure of the
                            more grandiose military schemes may also enhance popular support for
                            guerrilla activities.</p>

                                xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>as the Rabat conference opened—probably
                            contributed to the Arab disarray at Rabat by casting doubt on the need
                            for all-out sacrifices in preparation for “inevitable” war. The result
                            was a double benefit for the US: because of our balanced position, the
                            summit was not in the mood to be as critical of the US as expected; and
                            the protracted talk and final breakdown over mobilization of Arab
                            resources meant that the conference ended without an opportunity to turn
                            to consideration of anti-US measures. In the wake of the conference,
                            however, it is possible that extremists may turn to anti-American
                            propaganda themes in their search for a scapegoat.</p>

                            Africa over the past year. Most conspicuous has been the coup in Libya.
                            But we also have President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>'s declining health in Tunisia. Morocco seems
                            calm on the surface, but there has long been dissatisfaction with the
                            government of young King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>.
                            Algeria seems to be steering a course of its own with a combination of
                            private American and official French and Soviet aid and it seems to have
                            improved its relations with Morocco and Tunisia recently. But it is the
                            potential power in North Africa, and we have as a government not paid as
                            much attention to it perhaps as we could have.</p>
                        <p>I propose a modest review of our programs in North Africa as they stack
                            up against the trend of events there. This would involve a <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> estimate of the prospects and a paper
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> process reviewing our options
                            in relation to the trends. I would bring this paper at least as far as
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review Group and leave open the
                            judgment on whether it would need to come to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss>. You have expressed a desire to discuss Libya there at
                            some point, but it may be that the purpose of focusing bureaucratic
                            attention on the problem more actively could be accomplished by this
                            exercise, leaving the results for your study outside of the <gloss

                        <p>Admiral Anderson is just back from a trip to Italy, Greece, Turkey,
                            Cyprus, Malta and Spain. He will compare notes with Messrs. Frank
                            Lincoln and Robert Murphy before submitting a broader report in response
                            to your request for a broad look at the area from Morocco to Iran. But
                            in the meantime he has some reflections he wants to bring to your
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>His main points are:</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to North Africa.]</p>
                        <p>2. Deterioration in North Africa. Those Admiral Anderson talked with
                            emphasized the threat to Tunisia and urged that the U.S. rely more on
                            the Europeans to uphold the Free World position. More specifically in
                            this connection he learned in confidence that the Moroccan government
                            had approached the Spanish and Portuguese proposing a three-member
                            defensive “arrangement.” He believes that Soviet involvement in North
                            Africa is “more real than even our most suspicious political and
                            intelligence authorities credit” and he feels our intelligence “leaves
                            much to be desired” there.</p>

                                Israeli Arms Request -</p>

                            <p>The President's announcement on January 30 that the decision on the
                                Israeli arms request will be made within the next thirty days, and
                                the secretary's presence in Morocco and Tunisia have focused North
                                African attention on the U.S. response in an ominous way. It is
                                clear that the North Africans expect the decision to be favorable to
                                the Israelis and that all of the governments in the area, including
                                the moderates, would be subjected to substantial pressure by local
                                public opinion, as well as by the radical Arabs, to retaliate
                                against the United States. We believe Morocco and Tunisia would
                                endeavor to resist these pressures. However, they would have to
                                yield to them at least to some degree in view of the recent evidence
                                of the growth of public support in both countries for the Palestine
                                cause.</p>

                            <p>It goes without saying that a decision to postpone action on the
                                Israeli request would have a positive effect on our relations with
                                all four North African states, although not in any dramatic
                                manner.</p>
                            <p>To the extent that we agree to provide further advanced aircraft,
                                however, we risk severe damage to U.S. interests in the area.</p>

                            <p>Our most exposed position is in Libya because of our important oil
                                interests, the size of our American colony and the fact that we are
                                still liquidating Wheelus. Libya's recent contract with France for
                                the purchase by the end of 1974 of “some 100” advanced aircraft has
                                of course given added momentum to the Israeli arms request. In a
                                sense, the Libyans “created” the present problem of dealing with the
                                Israelis because of their purchase of Mirages. This fact is,
                                however, unlikely to influence the Libyan reaction in view of the
                                current superiority of the Israeli Air Force and the minimum 3 to 5
                                year interval before the French aircraft are likely to be
                                operational.</p>
                            <p>The Libyan reaction could, at worst, mean the rupture of diplomatic
                                relations, which we doubt, or, perhaps, a request that we close our
                                Embassy office in Benghazi or our cultural centers. Pressures
                                against the American-controlled oil industry would certainly be
                                increased, and efforts to improve our bilateral relations and to
                                expand our dialogue with the regime would be severely set back. A
                                physical attack on our installations—permitted by the <gloss

                            <p>In Tunisia and Morocco, the governments would not wish to take any
                                direct actions against U.S. interests. Popular, and particularly
                                student, discontent with the U.S. decision could, however, result in
                                demonstrations against U.S. installations: the Embassies, the <gloss

                                Kenitra (U.S. Navy communications facility in Morocco). In the
                                longer run, these same pressures might force Morocco and Tunisia to
                                diverge increasingly from their close relationship with the U.S. The
                                Tunisian government's desire to avoid a confrontation with the
                                students during the Secretary's visit and Prime Minister <persName

                                Israel's aggressive attitude are two signs of the erosion of the
                                U.S. position. In both countries opposition elements are seizing
                                this issue and the regimes' ties to the U.S. to undermine internal
                                stability.</p>

                                setback. We believe any possibility of an early resumption of
                                relations would be nullified by a decision favoring the Israelis. In
                                view of Algeria's longer term importance in North Africa, we believe
                                it would be most unfortunate if our relative isolation from the
                                regime should be prolonged.</p>

                                likely to extend beyond economic cooperation and that the region was
                                turning toward Western Europe and away from close association with
                                either of the Cold War superpowers. This trend was likely to
                                continue as long as the United States continued to be closely

                                among the four North African countries. They do have some common
                                interests—a regional perspective, involvement with the Islamic
                                community, and much popular sympathy for the Arab cause against
                                Israel—and some common problems—notably massive unemployment and
                                rapidly increasing population. However, each government places first

                                Long-standing territorial disputes among Morocco, Algeria, and
                                Tunisia have recently been shelved, and their political relations
                                have improved, but they are not likely to go beyond a moderate
                                degree of economic cooperation and occasional foreign policy
                                coordination. In the Arab-Israeli dispute, Algeria, Tunisia, and
                                Morocco, at least, are likely to support the Palestinians rather
                                than commit sizable resources to the regular Arab armies.</item>

                                Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya have long been strongly
                                influenced both from Europe and from the Eastern Mediterranean.
                                Trade, warfare, and power politics have brought North Africa and
                                Europe into constant contact and occasional conflict throughout
                                recorded history. The Arab conquest of the eighth century made North
                                Africa solidly Muslim and imposed Arabic as the area's written
                                language. Ottoman power also prevailed for a time, although limited
                                for the most part to ports and coastal areas. In the 19th and early
                                20th centuries, European states took over control of the entire
                                area, even settling colonists in much of it.<note n="1"

                            <item>The colonial period had widespread and lasting effects. The
                                Europeans introduced a modern economy, operated by them for their
                                benefit, in and around the major coastal cities and in some inland
                                areas of particular fertility. They built excellent roads,
                                communications, power facilities, and other infrastructure items,
                                largely in those areas. Marked dualism developed between modern and
                                traditional economies, the latter supporting the vast majority of
                                the indigenous population. In the French-controlled states, French
                                language, culture, and education became widespread; the language in
                                particular was the passport required for those local inhabitants who
                                aspired to move into the European-dominated sectors of the economy
                                and society. To a considerable extent this has continued to the
                                present time, and European influence remains substantial. In Libya,
                                however, where the Italians enforced a form of segregation, the
                                cultural impact was superficial. In the aftermath of independence,
                                Libya came under the cultural, social, and even political influence
                                of the Arab states to the east—particularly Egypt—to a degree not
                                seen in the other North African countries.</item>

                                character of North Africa. The indigenous Berber tribes were not
                                absorbed by foreigners over the centuries; rather they accommodated
                                to their conquerors and often assimilated them, and Berber stock
                                remains identifiable throughout much of the area. The Muslim
                                religion practiced in North Africa is characterized both by
                                pre-Islamic practices and by a tendency toward extremist sects and
                                heresies. Most important, the people in all four countries share a
                                sense of common identity which owes much to the interaction of

                                dead and some 20 to 25 percent of the indigenous population was
                                displaced. The managerial and organizational structure of Algeria
                                was almost totally disrupted by the departure of a million
                                Europeans. Under the best of circumstances, the early years of
                                independence would have been difficult; as events transpired, they

                                leaders are consulted on major policy questions, but overt military
                                involvement in governmental affairs appears to have diminished. The

                                independence has not been significantly expanded in the past several
                                years. Boumediene retains the post of Defense Minister and controls
                                the military through a chosen lieutenant; although himself a product

                                The new regime put Algeria's formerly chaotic finances in order.
                                Rising foreign exchange receipts—oil revenues and remittances of
                                500,000 Algerian workers in France—combined with tight restrictions
                                on consumer imports and a cautious approach to new investment, led
                                to a steady accumulation of reserves, which exceeded $600 million at
                                the end of 1969. The Algerians are showing a new willingness to
                                compete for export markets, and semiautonomous state-owned firms now
                                manage nationalized businesses and are replacing the costly
                                worker-management system that had sprung up after independence.
                                During the past year or so, work on investment projects has greatly
                                accelerated and it now seems likely that the bulk of future
                                increases in foreign exchange earnings will be spent to promote
                                economic development.</item>

                            <item>Algeria seems in a position to maintain its economic momentum, at
                                least for the next several years. Projects already under way or
                                completed will permit the production and export of sufficient
                                petroleum and natural gas to finance the 1970-1973 development plan
                                without resort to heavy foreign borrowing. Petroleum production, now
                                at the rate of about 900,000 barrels per day, is likely to increase
                                at an average rate of 5 to 10 percent annually. Output of exportable
                                natural gas is scheduled to rise from 1.5 billion cubic meters (bcm)
                                annually to 5 billion during the same period.<note n="3"

                                    Algerian natural gas for 25 years is scheduled to begin in
                                    November 1973. Financing of the facilties for this additional

                                contracted to increase its annual gas purchases from 0.5 bcm to 4
                                bcm and a French market for at least half of total oil production
                                seems assured. By 1973, Algeria's annual foreign exchange earnings
                                will include about $800-$900 million from oil and about $100 million
                                from natural gas. Locally available fuel also provides a cheap
                                energy source for Algerian industry. Thus a continued growth rate of
                                about 6 percent (3 percent per capita) over the next several years
                                appears attainable within Algerian financial resources.</item>

                            <item>The outlook for the Algerian economy beyond the mid-1970s is
                                uncertain. Beginning in 1973, the government intends to channel
                                public investment into light industry and other sectors, with the
                                object of achieving full employment within a decade. In these
                                circumstances, substantial alleviation of the unemployment problem
                                is years away. Realization of these governmental intentions,
                                moreover, depends on continuing growth of foreign exchange earnings
                                and hence on locating adequate new deposits of oil and the requisite
                                markets for oil and natural gas.</item>

                            <item>Our evidence on the degree of political support for the government
                                is scanty; certainly outward manifestations of opposition have been
                                few in recent years. Boumediene apparently does not seek a
                                charismatic image and certainly does not project one, but neither
                                does his diffident manner inspire antagonism. He is gradually
                                erecting a set of largely powerless representative institutions and
                                is moving to bring the trade union, student organizations, and other
                                special interest groups under closer government control. The adult
                                population has passively accepted these initiatives; it will
                                probably remain war weary and in no mood to support revolution or
                                civil uprising that could lead to widespread bloodshed. Students and
                                unemployed youth, although attracted by the regime's revolutionary
                                slogans, dislike its authoritarian style. Their opposition will
                                probably flare up periodically, although it does not pose the same
                                threat as would factional strife within the army and regime. We
                                cannot rule out either assassination or a coup—with unpredictable
                                results—but we think the present regime has a good chance of
                                continuing to govern Algeria for some years to come.</item>

                                    >Hassan</persName> has successfully gathered all political power
                                into his own hands and is intent on maintaining this position. He
                                clearly seeks to protect himself from such modern movements as
                                republicanism, socialism, and pan-Arab nationalism. Whereas for a
                                time after Independence in 1956 the political system was responsive
                                to a wider range of interest groups, it has been greatly narrowed.
                                Some political parties are permitted to exist, to hold meetings, and
                                to publish newspapers (subject to frequent suspension). Otherwise,
                                political activity has been suspended since June 1965, and the King
                                has given no sign that he intends to end this “state of exception,”
                                at least until he is confident that he has arranged to control a
                                future parliament. He relies on traditional palace advisers and
                                increasingly on a group of key officials, many of rural Berber
                                origins. Hasan has placed these individuals in positions of
                                authority in the armed forces, security apparatus, local
                                administration, and major economic sectors.</item>

                            <item>The King is anxious to preserve the foundations of his political
                                control. Hence he has chosen to refurbish traditionally loyalist
                                institutions and to resist social and economic innovations. The
                                overriding attention which the palace gives to political matters has
                                been one factor leading to limited educational opportunities and
                                health facilities in Morocco. Expenditures in these fields are the
                                lowest in the area on a per capita basis; in literacy rate (about 15
                                percent) and in the proportion of children attending school, Morocco
                                does roughly half as well as the other North African countries.
                                Similarly the primacy of political goals, combined with limited
                                resources and undependable weather, have resulted in a decade of
                                economic stagnation in Morocco. Since Independence, Morocco has
                                received about $1.5 billion in foreign aid, including some $80
                                million from the US. Rapid population growth, however, has absorbed
                                most economic gains, and per capita income has remained roughly what
                                it was in 1960.</item>

                            <item>Future economic prospects are no brighter. The development plan
                                for 1968-1972 envisages the highest investment level in Moroccan
                                history but aims for a growth rate of only 4 percent; since
                                population is growing at about 3.3 percent annually, fulfillment of
                                the plan would raise per capita incomes by only about one-half of 1
                                percent per year. Even the modest objectives for the 4 year period
                                will not necessarily be achieved. Goals are predicated on adequate
                                rainfall throughout the plan period, whereas periodic droughts are
                                to be expected in Morocco. Economic growth in the first year of the
                                plan period was 12 to 13 percent, thanks to an excellent harvest
                                after 2 years of drought, but total output declined in 1969.

                                or to born abroad on anything except concessional terms. Annual
                                investment targets involving roughly $150 million from foreign
                                sources and $250 million from domestic sources, therefore, may not
                                be met.</item>

                                in the near future. His roots and those of the dynasty are deep; his

                                temporal role and binds his people to him, especially in the
                                countryside. The King's favored appointees are well rewarded and are
                                not likely to mount a threat to the throne. Because <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s father became a leading
                                symbol of the independence movement, anticolonialism did not become
                                antimonarchical; this is an important element in the royal family's
                                strength. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is fully
                                aware that the principal danger lies in the discontented elements in

                                support. Politicians who speak out against him or against existing

                                jailed. With a deft combination of force and favor, he probably can
                                suppress or buy off potential dissidents for at least several years

                                question. Moroccans will come to see that the comparison between

                                to hold them to the land or to provide housing or jobs in the

                                likely to decline over time. Even today, a carefully hatched plot
                                along Libyan lines cannot be ruled out. The urban elite have
                                recognized the military as a promising career for their sons, and

                                the rural Berber element in the armed forces, he eventually will

                                style has always been dramatic and abrupt; he has leapt forward with
                                new ideas, then inched backward to a level of innovation that his
                                countrymen would tolerate. Rather than use religious tradition to
                                bolster his own position, he has openly advocated discarding the
                                trappings of medieval Islam. He has been equally innovative in
                                economic affairs—vineyards have been uprooted to make way for other
                                crops, communal farming has been introduced, new industries have
                                sprung up throughout the small country. Tunisia has embarked on a
                                widespread birth control program and has poured money into education

                            <item>To date the results of this activist approach have been mixed. On
                                the positive side, the economy has grown at an annual rate of almost
                                4.5 percent for the past decade, while the rate of population
                                growth—though it has risen slowly—is about 2.8 percent. Industry now
                                provides about 15 percent of the national product, compared to about
                                10 percent at independence. Over half of the eligible children are
                                in school, and literacy is increasing rapidly. The Destourian
                                Socialist Party began as a pre-independence popular movement and has
                                functioned reasonably well. Elections have been held on schedule
                                and, within the limits of a one party system, have provided a
                                modicum of choice and a minimum of violence. Tunisia has stayed
                                largely aloof from the Arab-Israeli conflict and has maintained
                                peaceful, if not always amicable, relations with its neighbors;

                                future than Morocco's relative stagnation is of imminent revolution.
                                Success has been costly in both monetary and social terms.
                                Maintaining and expanding the economy has absorbed over $1 billion
                                in foreign aid (including about $600 million from the US) since
                                independence and the gap between foreign earnings and foreign
                                expenditures has seldom fallen below $100 million per annum. Tourism
                                has begun to bring in foreign revenues, but it cannot hope to earn
                                enough to replace aid for years. Economic problems are likely to
                                present a major challenge to any Tunisian government in the next few
                                years. An immediate concern is to repair extensive damage to roads,
                                railways, and farms caused by disastrous floods in 1969. Most of the
                                relatively easy opportunities for stimulating growth have already
                                been seized; the country has been exhaustively explored for new
                                mineral resources without much success. Foreign debt service charges
                                have more than doubled in the past five years and will remain high
                                at least for several years to come. Private foreign investment has
                                been discouraged by a government which has nationalized or
                                collectivized virtually the entire economy; only tourism has
                                remained in private hands and attractive to foreign
                                investors.</item>

                                already begun to reverse the extreme policy of forced agricultural
                                collectivization, started by former economic czar Ahmed Ben Salah,
                                which had aroused strong opposition. The balance between
                                collectively owned and individually owned agricultural land probably
                                will shift back somewhat in favor of the independent farmer, and
                                there are pressures which may over the long term bring some return
                                to private ownership in such fields as retail trade. Even such minor
                                corrections, however, will antagonize that element in Tunisian
                                society (principally confined to the universities at present) which
                                believes that <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Ben Salah</persName>'s
                                program would have been successful if pursued to its conclusion. In
                                any event, socialism in some form is likely to remain the dominant
                                economic philosophy. Moreover, inability to attract sufficient
                                foreign aid and other capital to finance foreign exchange
                                requirements is likely to force Tunisian to retrench economically;
                                the need for enforcing austerity is likely, in turn, to lend to more
                                authoritarian political methods.</item>

                                military presence. It completed the Libyanization of foreign-owned

                                prohibition, presumably out of deference to Islamic fundamentalism.
                                It removed foreign-language signs and deleted English language
                                courses from the school curriculum. It carried out widespread

                            <item>A Libyan attempt to nationalize oil production does not appear
                                likely. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out, especially in
                                the event of major Arab-Israeli military hostilities. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is deeply committed to the Arab
                                cause, and oil is the major weapon at Libyan disposal. An embargo of
                                oil shipments to certain countries is much more likely in such
                                circumstances than is nationalization. Selective oil embargos,
                                however, are relatively easy to circumvent, especially in view of
                                the many alternative sources of oil. Should Libya choose to attempt
                                nationalization, it is in a unique position to carry through without
                                severe damage to itself. Twenty-five percent of the crude oil
                                imported in 1968 by the European Common Market countries—and 43
                                percent of West German imports—came from Libya. Independent oil
                                companies in importing countries would probably not refuse to buy
                                oil from nationalized companies, as long as the price remained
                                competitive. Furthermore, Libya has accumulated foreign exchange
                                reserves adequate to ride out a lengthy period during which it could
                                seek new customers; imports other than oil field equipment could be
                                maintained at current levels for roughly two years with the funds
                                Libya now has on hand. The strong Libyan position in regard to
                                nationalization will diminish in a year or two with rising oil
                                production from the Gulf of Guinea—principally Nigeria—and with
                                substantial increases in world tanker tonnage. In any event, with

                            <item>The recent shelving of long-standing territorial claims among the
                                French-speaking states of North Africa have markedly improved their
                                political relations. These disputes, which kept tensions high and
                                even provoked border clashes, have now been formally resolved or set
                                aside at Algeria's initiative. Since January 1969, Algeria has
                                concluded treaties with Morocco and with Tunisia that call for
                                permanent peace between the parties, renunciation of force in the
                                case of disputes, and non-adherence by either party to any pact or

                                led to Morocco's formal recognition of Mauritania, thus, in effect,
                                renouncing long-standing Moroccan claims to that country. And
                                Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania appear willing to cooperate with
                                Morocco in pressing Spain to relinquish political control of the

                            <item>With territorial issues shelved, the North African countries may
                                move forward on economic collaboration. For example, iron ore
                                deposits in Algeria would become profitable to exploit if
                                transportation across Morocco to the Atlantic could be arranged.
                                Negotiations for a preferential trade zone in North Africa (perhaps
                                including Mauritania) were slated to resume in March 1970 but were
                                postponed; if such an agreement eventually is reached, it would
                                afford some small advantages to each of the participants. However,
                                all of the North African countries are concerned principally with
                                their internal problems and have a distinct sense of their own
                                individuality; moreover, their international economic interests are
                                divergent. For these reasons, a moderate degree of economic and
                                occasional foreign policy coordination represents the likely limit
                                of their cooperation.</item>

                            <item>The revolution in Libya, however, has helped to stimulate
                                cooperation among the other North African states, and future events
                                in Libya will have a substantial impact throughout the area. For
                                Morocco and Tunisia, the Libyan revolution was a blow, raising the
                                specter of the overthrow of conservative governments by radicals and
                                removing one more country from the dwindling ranks of Arab states
                                maintaining an avowedly pro-Western foreign policy. The Algerian
                                Government probably cheered the revolution, but the subsequent
                                increase of Egyptian influence in Libya was no more welcome in
                                Algiers than in Rabat or Tunis. Algeria would like to have Libya as
                                a collaborator on oil policy and an independent member of the Arab
                                family, rather than a stooge or tool of Cairo. Morocco and Tunisia
                                are worried about Libya as a possible base for Egyptian—and perhaps
                                eventually Soviet—subversion. There are clear signs, however, that
                                the present Libyan leaders are strongly opposed to both communist
                                ideology and Soviet tutelage and that some are equally fearful of
                                Egyptian intentions. If Libyan nationalists prevail in Tripoli, the
                                other countries will be somewhat reassured. On the other hand, if
                                Libya pursues a pro-Egyptian course, this will probably lead to
                                greater political collaboration among Tunisia, Morocco, and
                                Algeria.</item>

                            <item>Since 1967, the Arab-Israeli dispute has increasingly engaged the
                                attentions of the North African states. Algeria, Tunisia, and
                                Morocco do not wish to become deeply involved but, for reasons of
                                both domestic and inter-Arab politics, cannot afford to remain
                                entirely aloof. They wish to minimize the commitment of their
                                resources to the buildup of regular Arab armies arrayed against
                                Israel, which they probably see as a futile effort; hence, their
                                support has been given principally to the Palestinians. Algeria's
                                long-standing support for the fedayeen is likely to continue and
                                increase. Both Morocco and Tunisia will probably step up somewhat

                            <item>The new Libyan regime has chosen to join the ranks of the militant

                                Libya's military forces are very small. The regime has arranged to
                                purchase over 100 jet aircraft from France, but the bulk of these
                                planes are not scheduled for delivery for some years. Moreover,
                                their effective operational use will require extended training for
                                pilots and maintenance personnel and establishment of an adequate
                                ground support system. Even if Libyan planes were made available to
                                Egypt, Egypt lacks the personnel to operate them. Hence, Libyan
                                planes will not materially affect Arab military capabilities against
                                Israel at least for the next three or four years.</item>

                                obvious), Algerian and Libyan units certainly would be provided, and
                                probably Moroccan and Tunisian ones as well. The depth of popular
                                emotion in all the North African countries probably would compel
                                such actions, although Tunis and Rabat, at any rate, would move

                                in Arab and African affairs. Algeria's national oil company has

                                Yemen, and Iraq and has proposed similar arrangements with Libya and

                                visits with some ruling political parties in Arab states. No major
                                expansion of such activity is likely. Under Qaddafi, Libya is
                                actively cultivating closer relations with the Eastern Arabs,
                                especially Egypt and the Sudan. Libya's money, however, is likely to
                                be more consequential than its political role.</item>

                                Algeria sympathizes with and provides office space and subsidies for

                                in Algeria; he has recently concluded a small military procurement
                                and training agreement with France that is evidently the beginning
                                of an attempt to diversify sources of arms procurement.</item>

                            <item>France is likely to expand its already substantial influence in
                                North Africa in the years ahead. Recent French policy initiatives
                                appeal to the North Africans. Among them are an emphasis on the role
                                of the Palestinians in the Arab-Israeli dispute, the embargo on arms
                                sales to Israel, and willingness to sell arms to some Arab
                                customers. France favors eventual withdrawal of non-riparian naval
                                forces from the Mediterranean and may indeed be orchestrating a
                                campaign to that end. The small sale of French arms to Algeria and
                                the subsequent multimillion dollar aircraft deal with Libya will
                                probably be followed by further arms sales in North Africa. Over
                                600,000 North Africans presently work in France and this number may
                                rise somewhat. The French Government undoubtedly will attempt to
                                promote the commercial interests of French oil companies and other
                                French businesses in North Africa. France is also likely to court
                                North Africa by providing increased technical assistance, by
                                continuing to buy North African products, and by promoting North
                                African efforts to expand preferential access to the European
                                Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>).</item>

                            <item>This is not to say that relations between France and the North
                                African countries will be uniformly smooth. Even during <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>'s day, there were serious
                                and unresolved disagreements between Algeria and France—notably over
                                French reneging on a contract to purchase Algerian wine. Other
                                bilateral problems are likely to arise in the next few years. In
                                addition, impending renegotiation of Franco-Algerian oil agreements
                                is bound to cause some frictions between the two. France has
                                recently normalized relations with Morocco and made some
                                conciliatory gestures toward Tunisia as well. It is likely to
                                increase economic and military aid to both—though probably not as
                                much as they would like. The North African countries will continue
                                to compete with one another for the French market—a major recipient
                                of their oil and agricultural goods—and will seek special favors at
                                one another's expense. Thus periodic strains in relations among the
                                North African states and in dealings between France and individual
                                states are likely.</item>

                            <item>US relations with Morocco and Tunisia are cordial; the US has
                                important commercial interests in Libya and Algeria but official
                                relations only with the former. Friendly government to government
                                relations are almost certain to persist between the US and Morocco
                                and Tunisia, at least as long as the present regimes remain in power
                                there. Both regimes look to US friendship as in some measure a
                                bulwark against domestic as well as foreign enemies. Beyond this,
                                attitudes of all four countries toward the US are likely to depend
                                to a very large degree on how they interpret and react to US
                                policies and actions on matters going beyond North Africa itself.
                                Among these are, for example, the question of arms sales to Israel
                                and diplomatic positions in the Arab-Israeli issue, support or

                            <item>So long as the US remains closely identified in Arab eyes with
                                Israel and Israel remains in occupation of Arab territory, any
                                substantial growth of US influence in North Africa is highly
                                unlikely. Indeed, frictions and irritations are almost certain to
                                recur at frequent intervals. However, if the Arab-Israeli issue does
                                not flare up into widespread new hostilities, we anticipate a
                                continued gradual warming of Algerian-US commercial relations. The
                                existing governments of Tunisia and Morocco will continue to
                                cooperate with the US, but perhaps less readily than in the past;
                                warming North African relations with France, reductions in the level
                                of US aid, and growing doubt in both Tunisia and Morocco about
                                American willingness to actively defend the regimes will all work to
                                loosen ties to the US. In sum, now that the shock of independence
                                and decolonization have been weathered, the North African states are
                                once again turning toward Western Europe and deemphasizing the close

                        <p>The Department of State understands that no substantive action by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on NSSM 87 may be expected in
                            the near future. Consequently, the question arises as to whether any
                            action should be taken at the level of the Inter-Departmental Group.</p>
                        <p>In view of the substantial amount of analysis that went into the
                            preparation of NSSM 87 and the wide area of agreement reached with
                            respect to the definition of our interests in North Africa, it is
                            suggested that the Review Group be informed of the Inter-Departmental
                            Group's judgment that although no further action is required at this
                            time with respect to NSSM 87, the following consensus does exist at the
                            Inter-Departmental level: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Within the limits imposed by its resources, the United States
                                    should continue an active relationship with North Africa where
                                    it maintains appreciable interests. These interests include
                                    Moroccan and Tunisian goodwill and their general understanding
                                    of U.S. policies, access by the U.S. to communications
                                    facilities at Tangier and Kenitra, the improvement of relations
                                    with Algeria, the important U.S. private investments in Libya,
                                    and potentially important commercial and investment
                                    opportunities for American firms. Because of its geographic
                                    relationship to the Mediterranean, North Africa will also figure
                                    in wider U.S. concerns.</p>
                                <p>“For historical and other reasons, Western European governments
                                    may also be expected to be active in varying degrees in North
                                    Africa. Such activity may generally be beneficial to broader
                                    Western interests in the area and could coincide with those of
                                    the United States. Thus, while remaining mindful of its own
                                    specific interests and concerned with their protection, the U.S.
                                    should be generally receptive to Western European involvement in
                                    North Africa.</p>

                                <p>“In our relations with area governments, changes in their
                                    internal character and possibly in their policies may be
                                    expected; we should avoid involvement to the extent possible in
                                    those internal changes and remain prepared to cooperate with all
                                    governments in the area in furtherance of our interests.</p>
                                <p>“Decisions on specific issues as they arise in North Africa
                                    should be made with the foregoing general posture in mind.”</p>

                                concluded that “The North Africans in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia
                                have a character and history which distinguish them from the Eastern
                                Arabs and give them somewhat different foreign policy options,
                                particularly those growing out of their closer relationship with
                                Western Europe. The North African governments are turning toward
                                Western Europe—especially France—and away from the close association
                                with either the United States or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> that characterized their policies in the 1950s and
                                1960s. US influence in North Africa will remain severely limited
                                while the US remains closely identified in Arab eyes with Israel and
                                Israel remains in occupation of Arab territory. The <gloss

                        <p>In sum, France has reasserted itself as a force to be reckoned with in
                            the Mediterranean region.</p>
                        <p>France's interests in the Mediterranean are not only the product of its
                            quest for grandeur. It relies on Libya and Algeria for 45 percent of its
                            oil, and Iraq contributes another 20 percent. Proceeds from sales of
                            arms contribute significantly to French foreign exchange earnings. A
                            solid position in North Africa helps ensure continued access to and
                            influence in Francophone Black Africa. An active Mediterranean policy
                            offers some hope of developing strength against a Soviet presence in the
                            Mediterranean that the French view with concern and an American presence
                            that they view with something less than enthusiasm.</p>

                        <p>The French are aware, however, that the American presence is still
                            essential. Even in the darkest days of the Franco-US relationship,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName> made clear that he
                            did not want to see the Sixth Fleet withdrawn. Indeed, it is the
                            protective umbrella of the US presence that enables France to pursue its
                            Mediterranean policy.</p>
                        <p>French hopes of offering an alternative to both the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are far from realization and their
                            prospects of becoming the premier power in the Mediterranean are
                            actually slim. The other regional states are no more enthusiastic about
                            French domination than they would be about Soviet or U.S. hegemony.
                            Particularly the former French colonies are anxious to diversify their
                            support in order to avoid the reimposition of a de facto colonial
                            situation presided over by France. The Eastern Arabs, while welcoming
                            France's attitude, know well that only the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> or the U.S. can decisively influence affairs in their
                            region.</p>
                        <p>A French role could be effective as the principal component of increased
                            European involvement in Mediterranean affairs. It is difficult to
                            envision France sharing a leadership position with others, however, and
                            the other Europeans would probably find France an extremely difficult
                            partner.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d11-07" facs="d11-07"/>
                        <p>We, too, might find France's role a difficult one. It has already been
                            unhelpful in the Arab-Israeli question, and is not likely to be amenable
                            to suggestions from us on its Mediterranean policy. On the other hand,
                            France has already played a useful role in Algeria by providing an
                            alternative to Soviet involvement, and even the Libyan aircraft sale can
                            be seen in a similar light.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to the review of November 5, 1971, following are the conclusions
                            of our meeting with respect to U.S. policy toward North Africa for the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 review period.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Approach</hi> - Our dealings with the North African
                            countries must be in a bilateral framework. The regional states are not
                            closely bound together, and there is no overriding external issue
                            (East-West problems, Arab-Israeli dispute) that provides scope for
                            dealing with the region as a whole.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Interests</hi> - U.S. interests in the region,
                            while limited and not vital, are significant. Our most important
                            interests relate to oil (Libya) and natural gas (Algeria) and the
                            balance of payments benefits that we gain from oil investment. Other
                            interests are the Kenitra facility and the location of Morocco at the
                            entrance to the Mediterranean. Yet these strategic considerations must
                            be kept in proper perspective; in particular, the potential threat to
                            these interests is easily overemphasized.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Threat</hi> - Our strategic concerns are protected
                            in reasonable degree by the nationalism of the states in the region,
                            which acts as a barrier to Soviet attempts to <pb n="2" xml:id="d12-02"
                                facs="d12-02"/>install a Soviet military presence or zone of Soviet
                            influence along the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The same
                            nationalism, however, also acts against our interest in maintaining
                            special positions in the region (political in Tunisia; political and
                            military in Morocco). Over time, these positions are likely to erode.
                            The danger to our position in the oil industry is more substantial.
                            While Libyan nationalism is an important threat to it, the problem must
                            be dealt with in the overall context of our global oil policy. (A
                            special study on the international oil situation is now in preparation
                            pursuant to <gloss target="#t_PASM1">PASM</gloss> 4.) In sum, despite a
                            fairly high level of U.S. interests, we are limited in what we can
                            do—or, fortunately, need do—to protect them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Programs</hi> - Our programs in North Africa, by
                            and large, appear appropriate to the situation at this time. (See
                            attached Summary Sheet). Aid is concentrated on Tunisia and Morocco and
                            these two countries deserve continued emphasis. (The longer term future
                            of these bilateral aid relationships is a question which we plan to look
                            at more systematically in next year's review.) Also, we should continue
                            to keep under review possible opportunities resulting from the changed
                            situation in the Sudan. We recognize that within the African framework,
                            some shift in aid allocations may be called for away from North Africa
                            in favor of the Black African countries, assuming that Congressional
                            cuts in economic aid appropriations compel us to reassess priorities. We
                            need to keep a continuing close look on military supply programs lest we
                            become too closely identified with regimes whose prospects are not too
                            reassuring (especially Morocco). Similarly, we need to keep a rein on
                            our rhetoric when talking of these regimes. Some increased emphasis on
                            trade promotion, particularly vis-a-vis Algeria, is probably warranted.
                            Current staffing patterns appear appropriate except in Libya where we
                            are in the process of phasing down and Tangier which will be closed.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Europe and Trade Preferences</hi> - In the most
                            important fields our interests in North Africa are parallel to those of
                            the Europeans and we welcome their deep and substantial involvement in
                            the area. (In any event there is little that we could do to exclude
                            them.) At the same time, we cannot assume that the European role will
                            always be beneficial to our own interests, in particular in regard to
                            issues in the trade and petroleum areas on which we must take a stand

                            The granting of reverse preferences is such a case. Nevertheless, we
                            should, on balance, be flexible on preferences granted by the European
                            Community to the Maghreb states. In cases where we feel that we should
                            protect these, we must have very specific data on the losses that we
                            stand to incur.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The period from April 1968 to April 1969, from the viewpoint of U.S.
                            interests and objectives in Algeria, was marked by a slight
                            preponderance of trends favorable to the U.S. On the plus side,
                            Algeria's internal political stability has improved. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> appears to be ruling the
                            country with increased self-confidence. The <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> has placed first priority on domestic concerns such as
                            industrial development programs, reform of the agricultural sector,
                            establishment of permanent government structures, and maximizing
                            revenues from the oil and gas industry and wine exports. Algeria has of
                            course remained vociferously anti-imperialist, a loud supporter of armed
                            struggle by the Palestinians in the Middle East, and an underwriter of
                            modest assistance for African liberation movements. However, the fact
                            remains that the lion's share of the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                            >GOA</gloss>'s money and manpower is being spent on improving the
                            domestic situation. In another significant and favorable trend, Algeria
                            has worked hard over the past few months to improve significantly
                            cooperation with its Maghreb neighbors.</p>
                        <p>On the minus side, Soviet influence over the past year has continued to
                            grow. Although the Algerians steadfastly maintain they will not grant
                            military bases to foreigners (Russians), Soviet leverage based on
                            substantial military, economic and trade programs is stronger. France
                            remains the key Western influence in Algeria, but during the past year
                            the French role continued to decline.</p>
                        <p>U.S.-Algerian relations underwent a steady improvement during the year
                            under review, although a resumption of diplomatic relations is still not
                            in sight. The Middle East and Vietnam remain major issues of <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d13-02" facs="d13-02"/>disagreement. U.S.-Algerian relations
                            in the private business and economic sector have experience a boom. In
                            1968, the U.S. became the number two supplier to Algeria, with estimated
                            sales of $60 million. The <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            increasingly looked to U.S. firms and technicians to help in the
                            development of the Algerian petroleum and other related industries.</p>
                        <p>Chances for renewal of diplomatic relations in 1969 are about even. The
                            initiative rightly belongs to the Algerians and we do not advocate any
                            preconditions. The evolution of the Middle East situation is probably
                            the single most important determinant. U.S. business community interests
                            in Algeria merit a shift from neutrality to a more active encouragement
                            from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. These business interests
                            form the backbone of the U.S. current presence in Algeria. Private
                            organizations (CARE, CRS, Ford Foundation, IVS, Quakers) have also made
                            an important contribution to the U.S. presence and merit continuation.
                            Resumption of any significant <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            cultural program will probably have to await diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>If the principal Western influence in Algeria—France—should lose ground
                            radically in the near future, this would create a new situation which
                            the U.S. would have to examine.</p>

                        <p>These serious allegations of U.S. involvement in internal Algerian
                            affairs come at a time when there has been a steady improvement in
                            U.S.-Algerian relations. The most recent sign came when President
                            EISENHOWER died March 28. Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Houari Boumediene</persName> sent a message of condolences to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, the first
                            communication between the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> at this level since the break of
                            relations in June 1967.</p>
                        <p>How then should the charges made at Oran be interpreted? As a new period
                            of decline in US-Algerian relations or a genuine “incident de parcours"?
                            We tend to believe that the business in Oran was an aberration and that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> still remains interested in the
                            gradual improvement of relations with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>A number of diplomatic and other sources have expressed the view that
                            publishing of Belahssen's testimony is part of Boumediene's internal
                            political balancing act, that a number of Algerians in the Party
                            elsewhere remain chronically suspicious of U.S. intentions and this was
                            the regime's way of tossing them a bone. These same sources also pointed
                            out that strong intimations of involvement by French and Egyptian secret
                            services were also voiced at the trial. Of course these accusations were
                            much less precise. The U.S. is still the easiest and biggest scapegoat
                            available to Algeria. Finally, the Oran trial served a useful domestic
                            purpose—to warn the Algerian public of the harsh punishment which the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> will mete out to anyone involved
                            in opposition activities.</p>
                        <p>For what it is worth, the Algerian press made hay of Belahssen's
                            testimony for two days after the trial ended. Then the press campaign
                            was abruptly turned off—as neatly as a water tap.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important as an indicator was the reaction of <persName
                                corresp="#p_YL1">Layachi Yaker</persName>, the number three Foreign
                            Ministry official, when I called upon him to express the concern and
                            displeasure of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YL1">Yaker</persName> made three points in reply: 1) the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> had no doubt about the
                            authenticity of the contacts by the opposition group with <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and other Americans, since they were
                            supported by details of time, place, etc.; 2) that these took place
                            during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, a period of <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d14-03" facs="d14-03"/>special difficulty in
                            US-Algerian relations; and 3) the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            nevertheless looked forward with much hope to the absence of such
                            contacts during the present American administration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_YL1">Yaker</persName> then made a special point of
                            repeating the language which he had used during the December visit of

                        <p>Algeria has long been a paradox. It is a radical Arab state with fairly
                            close ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; it is also a
                            major, wealthy oil-producer, and a long time recipient of subsidies from
                            and favorable treatment by France. Its government is avowedly socialist
                            and anti-US in its public pronouncements, but it has substantial
                            dealings with American technicians and corporations. Alleged by some,
                            particularly the Moroccans, to be a pliable instrument of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Algeria in fact has occasionally
                            been critical of the Soviets and jealously guards its independence.</p>
                        <p>Algeria may continue to follow a similarly mixed pattern. Yet quite a
                            different course of developments is possible: one which would entail a
                            deterioration of its relations with France, bring on a change in its
                            dealings with the oil companies so severe as to have international
                            repercussions, and ultimately enhance its ties with the Soviet Union. We
                            do not estimate this to be the probable sequence of events; we do regard
                            it as a serious possibility worthy of careful attention.</p>

                            <item>Algeria became independent in 1962 after a bloody seven year
                                rebellion against the French. General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                    Gaulle</persName> was the sponsor and patron of the settlement.
                                He not merely agreed to the establishment of the state over bitter
                                opposition from the French military and from the politically
                                powerful French settlers in Algeria; he also provided it with the
                                financing for its early and difficult days. From 1962 to 1969,
                                France provided well over a billion dollars in economic aid and
                                technical assistance though on a declining scale. Half a million
                                Algerians continue to work in France and remit their earnings to
                                their families at home. France remains Algeria's principal trading
                                partner. <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> made no
                                special issue out of his failure to get compensation for the French
                                properties seized at independence; rather, he agreed to purchase
                                most of the wine produced by the formerly French-owned estates in
                                Algeria, though in progressively reduced quantities. In 1965, an
                                agreement was negotiated between the two governments which provided
                                for French purchase of Algerian oil at above world market prices.
                                Since then, production has substantially increased — as have
                                revenues — and Algeria has become a relatively wealthy state in the
                                underdeveloped world.<note n="*" xml:id="d15fn11">Current production
                                    is nearly one million barrels a day, giving Algeria an income of

                                technicians in Algeria. The Soviets are helping build a large steel

                                substantial Soviet aid projects have been promised. Recently the

                            <item>In seeking to develop Algeria along non-capitalist lines, the
                                government has sought the advice of numerous foreign expert economic
                                bodies, including the Soviet's GOSPLAN. And at least some of
                                GOSPLAN's recommendations appear to have been accepted. Since then
                                there have been working ties between Russian and Algerian planners,
                                technicians, engineers and the like, paralleling the working
                                relationships between their military counterparts. The Algerians are
                                seeking to develop as much autarchy as possible by establishing a
                                host of import substitution enterprises. Aided by some 2,000
                                Soviets, and by even more Frenchmen, Germans, Americans, and other
                                Westerners, Algeria is now embarked on a major economic development
                                program. Most investment is in costly projects designed to make
                                Algeria, ultimately, a sizeable industrial power with jobs and
                                prosperity for all. But many years will be required to produce
                                results. In the interim, as in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>, the consumer comes last; living standards are
                                low, taxes high, and goods scarce. There is also widespread
                                unemployment.</item>

                            <item>This development program is far from being Russian directed or
                                administered however. Indeed, one of the Algerian government's
                                principal aims is to acquire or maintain its own control of all
                                elements of the economy, including those in which the Soviets are
                                participating. To this end, it has nationalized or taken over the
                                direction of virtually all foreign private enterprises in Algeria,
                                except for foreign, principally French, oil companies. At the same
                                time, it is launching a host of new joint ventures with Western,
                                including many American, private corporations in such fields as oil
                                exploration. It is also directly hiring the services of American
                                consultants — e.g., Arthur D. Little, Inc. — and is seeking American
                                equipment and expertise for such items as computer systems and even
                                whole factories.</item>

                            <item>Further, the Algerian government-owned oil and gas company,
                                SONATRACH, is seeking to sell its products directly to foreign
                                countries. A recently signed contract with the EL PASO Natural Gas
                                Company is its most notable success so far. If the financing of this
                                project goes through, an investment of over $900 million ($300
                                million by EL PASO, $600 million by the Algerians) will be made and
                                SONATRACH will sell large <pb n="7" xml:id="d15-07" facs="d15-07"

                            <item>A common thread runs through all this activity. In each case the
                                Algerian government refuses to surrender control of any project to
                                an outsider. Unlike the traditional oil concessions of the Middle
                                East over the years, which grant outside companies considerable
                                latitude in determining such matters as exploration and production,
                                all Algerian joint venture agreements give the host government 51
                                percent of the shares — and operating control. The highly paid
                                foreign consultants and technicians are employees of the Algerian
                                government, which can hire and fire them at will. The expensive
                                expertise and equipment being purchased is paid for by Algeria's oil
                                revenues, and this gives it substantial freedom of action.</item>

                            <item>Algeria's foreign policies are not unlike its domestic ones. It
                                seeks to maintain freedom from outside domination and direction,
                                while pursuing courses of action and adopting attitudes consistent
                                with its own revolutionary principles. It normally sympathizes with
                                the socialist world rather than the capitalist one. It views the US
                                government with suspicion <pb n="8" xml:id="d15-08" facs="d15-08"
                                />and frequently with hostility. It particularly objects to US
                                policy in Vietnam and in the Middle East; it regards the efforts of
                                the Viet Cong and the Palestinians as counterparts of its own
                                revolutionary struggle, and casts the US in the role of the French
                                in that conflict.</item>

                            <item>Soviet-Algerian relations, on the other hand, are generally good.
                                Russian naval craft can call at Algerian ports, but do so very
                                infrequently. The state controlled press printed only the Tass
                                version of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Soviets, for
                                their part, frequently praise Algeria as a progressive Arab state
                                developing in a correct manner. But even with extensive arms supply
                                programs and many ideological affinities, Soviet influence remains
                                limited. Many more Westerners than Russians are engaged in Algerian
                                development efforts, and there are no signs of change in this
                                respect. The two countries openly disagree on some issues, notably
                                on the Arab-Israeli conflict; the Algerians ridicule Soviet efforts
                                to achieve a peaceful solution, saying that the only acceptable
                                course of action there is for the Palestinians to emulate Algeria's
                                independence struggle.</item>

                            <item>This and other differences may lead to private debates between
                                Algerian and Soviet officials, but to only a few open signs of
                                acrimony; they are being treated on both sides as something to agree
                                to disagree about. All in all, an appraisal of the degree of Soviet
                                influence on the Algerian government eventually becomes an exercise
                                in semantics. The counsels of the Russian Ambassador no doubt carry
                                weight, but are not decisive. Soviet-Algerian relations remain
                                excellent because both parties enjoy mutual advantages from them.
                                The question then arises: could the balance be tipped so that
                                Algeria would some day no longer be in its present strong position
                                to reject Moscow's “advice” on important issues? In this connection,
                                much will depend on Algeria's future relationships with two other
                                major outside forces it deals with: France and the oil
                                industry.</item>

                            <item>More serious to the Algerians is what they see as the unfriendly
                                policy of the French oil companies, who produce over 80 percent of
                                total Algerian output. Algiers charges that these companies are not
                                exploiting their fields to the fullest; further, it claims that in
                                failing to explore for further oil reserves, the French are not
                                living up to their obligations. The companies counter that virtually
                                all of Algeria's oil reserves have been located, that reserves are
                                being depleted so rapidly that overall output will sharply decline
                                over the next few years.<note n="1" xml:id="d15fn12">[text not

                                face. If so, the latter are in for a bad time; the American
                                companies have been treated with a harshness unmatched in the Middle

                                their earnings. Then in 1969, one of the US firms (Sinclair) was, on
                                a legal pretext, nationalized. Over the years, American oil men have

                                According to the latter, a new joint venture would be formed, with

                                it would sign such an agreement). But for a long time no company in

                                weapons of its own. On the one hand, the French government may feel
                                it could make Algeria suffer if drastic moves were to be taken
                                against French assets. France might be able, with the assistance of
                                the other major oil companies, to block the sales of Algeria's
                                petroleum and gas, which account for 70 percent of its export
                                revenues, in most parts of the non-Communist world. A cutoff of
                                Algerian petroleum would create no actual shortages in France, as
                                there are ample supplies in other parts of Africa, the Persian Gulf
                                and the Western Hemisphere. Beyond this, the French could refuse to

                                remain important sources of income. Pompidou, who would probably be

                                oil companies, including the American ones; acceptance of such
                                extreme Algerian demands would have a major impact on the world oil
                                industry, in which US firms play the principal role and which
                                provides a very important support to the US balance of payments. As

                                would probably start pushing hard for equal treatment. In these
                                circumstances, most oil companies would probably exert heavy
                                pressures on the French oil companies, and on the French and US
                                governments to resist Algerian demands.</item>

                                measures. The political climate remains uncertain. In the past two

                                had to put down an attempted coup, and narrowly escaped being
                                assassinated. There are opponents of the regime both inside and
                                outside the country and a successful conspiracy might take place in
                                agitated times. The regime's economic approach, which in fact
                                amounts to grinding down the present generation so the next will
                                enjoy high living standards, is probably becoming less and less

                                engendered by the brutal independence struggle. But that was seven
                                years ago, and another generation is on the way. Indeed, there are
                                some strong reasons for the Algerians to keep on good terms with the
                                French. However intense their revolutionary dogmas, they need the
                                money the French oil companies pay to support their ambitious and
                                expensive development program.</item>

                            <item>In these circumstances we might expect that a new Franco-Algerian
                                accord will be forthcoming in 1970 if indeed negotiations take
                                place. The Algerian government now receives some $600-700 million a
                                year in oil and gas revenues; it needs this money for its high
                                priority development program, that much or most of this income could
                                dry up in the event of a crisis. If the two parties behaved
                                rationally, they should arrive at a mutually acceptable

                                “Rational” can be a misleading term, particularly when concepts of

                                have maximum oil revenues with a minimum of French retaliatory acts,
                                it would almost certainly not generate a crisis. However, it may
                                decide that other goals are paramount.</item>

                            <item>There is little doubt that the Algerians would like to fully
                                control all the resources within their territory, and the French oil
                                companies are the only ones of any importance they do not now
                                control. In this respect, Algeria's leaders differ fundamentally
                                from the monarchs of Saudi Arabia or Libya, who feel quite
                                comfortable working with foreign companies on a concession basis.
                                The important question is, do the Algerians think they can getaway
                                with threatening or actually seizing the French companies?</item>

                            <item>The Algerians almost certainly recognize that they have some
                                effective means of putting pressure on the French. They see Paris
                                facing a balance of payments crisis. In the past year, they have
                                noted France drawing down half its foreign exchange reserves and
                                devaluating the franc so as to increase export earnings and decrease
                                import costs. The Algerians could, if they wished, further aggravate
                                Paris' balance of payments <pb n="17" xml:id="d15-17" facs="d15-17"
                                />problems. Thus in 1970 French oil companies in Algeria will expect
                                to repatriate up to $400 million in earnings to the metropole. Even
                                the threat of an Algerian freeze of these funds would have serious
                                repercussions. In such circumstances the Algerians might reason that
                                the French government could be induced to accept something like the
                                Getty formula, rather than lose everything.</item>

                            <item>Beyond this, the Algerians may calculate that they would not
                                suffer all that much if they moved against the French oil companies.
                                Algerian petroleum comes from west of the Suez Canal and is low in
                                sulphur content — both highly desirable attributes in Western Europe
                                these days. The Algerians may feel they could sell to independent
                                companies in Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Western Europe —
                                without having to share the earnings with the French. They may be
                                right (their nationalization of Sinclair has not hurt them); at
                                present, nobody knows how successful such efforts would be,
                                particularly over a fairly extended period of time. And the
                                Algerians could plan for a fairly extended time of crisis; they have
                                some $600 million in foreign exchange reserves. In any event, the
                                country's leaders have long been accustomed to adopting policies
                                entailing high risks and imposing personal hardships on the Algerian
                                people.</item>

                                come to their assistance. Though the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> is a net exporter of oil, it is already purchasing
                                small amounts from Algeria and might for political reasons, and
                                perhaps for economic ones as well, agree to take substantially more.
                                Armaments aside, the Algerians generally prefer Western industrial
                                equipment to that of Soviet manufacture. But if there were no
                                alternative, they would probably accept the latter in payment for
                                their oil. How far the Soviets would be willing or able to come to
                                the aid of their friends is open to question. But in the event of a
                                rupture in French-Algerian relations, they might take the
                                opportunity to enhance their influence in Algeria.</item>

                            <item>Secretary said he gathered relations had been improving for last
                                year or two; that this was good trend which we would like to see
                                continued. Asked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s views.
                                    <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> thanked Secretary for
                                providing opportunity to meet. Said that US-Algerian relations had
                                improved since 1967 break; that it not correct call it break, would
                                be more correct to call change “slow-down.” In fact, it seemed that
                                US-Algerian relations had never been better than during “slow-down.”
                                Cultural and economic fields in recent past had been quite positive,
                                notwithstanding day-to-day contingencies <pb n="2" xml:id="d16-02"
                                    facs="d16-02"/>and fluctuations of the international scene. He
                                believed we were meeting requirements for quite positive
                                relationship.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> indicated that Algerian
                                relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should not
                                preclude improvement in its relations with US, particularly in
                                economic field. Our relations should develop on same lines as with
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and France. What had
                                opposed development of relations were political problems of an
                                external character.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> felt that two countries
                                should be careful not to engage in changes that might prove
                                “traumatic” and leave sequels in future. Relations in economic field
                                were improving dramatically, particularly in field of hydrocarbons.
                                He believed that Sinclair, one of major oil firms with investments
                                in Algeria, would be acting in its own best interests if it did not
                                create a situation that would be useless and lead nowhere, because
                                there certainly possibilities of settling such disputes through
                                friendly compromise. This <pb n="3" xml:id="d16-03" facs="d16-03"
                                />was all more important as there were no opposing interests between
                                US oil corporations and Algeria; whereas in case of French
                                investments, very nature and size of holdings are a problem.
                                Compromise settlements with US would be useful in their negotiations
                                with French. It was Algeria's purpose to reduce the “immense” French
                                investments to manageable size.</item>

                                preserve of one or another great power, that it does not entertain
                                privileged relations with one great power or another but wanted
                                relations with all major powers.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then summarized his
                                presentation. Algeria was now working to consolidate its relations
                                in all fields and to achieve normalization in all aspects of its
                                economic development through its own efforts and through cooperation
                                with others, in the hope that its relations with US will enter a new
                                era known in past.</item>

                            <item>Secretary asked whether he had any specific ideas on <pb n="4"
                                    xml:id="d16-04" facs="d16-04"/>improving relations. <gloss
                                    target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he recognize that
                                efforts of cooperation are closely tied with political conditions.
                                He said he was now sure beyond a doubt that US was no longer
                                interested in Vietnam as such and that it wished to settle question
                                and establish peace. Algeria would always support any actions US
                                took toward peace. In Middle East a positive US gesture would make a
                                great impact on Algerians. He saw no essential impediments to
                                improvements.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Secretary thanked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> for
                                his presentation. He said we would consider seriously the question
                                of improving relations and expressed pleasure that relations had
                                improved some between the two countries in last few years. He agreed
                                Algeria was sometimes a “difficult partner” and said that he
                                understood. He noted US public and Congress generally felt that
                                Algeria was an aligned country, because it so often, almost without
                                exception, was aligned against US positions. It was hard to convince
                                them that we received the same <pb n="5" xml:id="d16-05"
                                    facs="d16-05"/>treatment as <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>. We hoped these obstacles could be overcome in
                                future because we had no interests in conflict. Secretary said US
                                Congress and public opinion did not expect Algeria to be aligned
                                with US, but they certainly did not want Algeria always aligned
                                against US. If they were always against us it would be hard to
                                convince people Algeria was unaligned. Secretary concluded, however,
                                that US would like to improve relations, and we would meet them half
                                way.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> responded that perhaps it
                                would be possible for him to consider designating someone in his
                                Department to be in direct contact with the US Charge in Algeria and
                                vice versa in Washington. Secretary said he thought that was good
                                idea, that we would designate someone promptly.</item>

                        <p>Referring to the previous notification that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> had been designated the point
                            of contact for the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> in the
                            Department, Yazid said that the contact in the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> Foreign Ministry would be designated following the
                            conference of Algerian chiefs of mission now taking place in Algiers.
                            Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> said that in making their decision
                            they should know that, depending on the rank of the Algerian designated,
                            we would be prepared to consider the contact on our side at the Deputy
                            Assistant Secretary level. (Yazid made no comment on this.)</p>
                        <p>Yazid noted that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> intended to
                            raise the level of its representation in Washington. He said the
                            decision as to who might head the Algerian Interests Section was not yet
                            taken. In response to <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName>'s
                            question, Yazid said that if the person were not Counselor <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>, it would be someone of at
                            least his seniority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> said that he had heard that Yazid had
                            made a tough speech critical of the U.S. on Viet Nam during the morning.
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d17-02" facs="d17-02"/>If so its contents would
                            seem to be at variance with the satisfaction expressed by Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> that the
                            “problem” of Viet Nam was on its way to resolution and his expression of
                            greater understanding of our objective. Mr.
                                <persName>Pedersen</persName> pointed out that sharp rhetoric on
                            Algeria's side would not make the resolution of our bilateral problems
                            any easier.</p>
                        <p>Yazid then said that there appeared to be three impediments in
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> relations: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The first, as his Foreign Minister had said, was Viet Nam.
                                    Yazid expressed the view that this problem appeared to be
                                    “fading away”. He hoped that with increased confidence between
                                    Algeria and the U.S., public and private positions could be as
                                    close as possible.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The second problem, he thought, had been Algeria's role in the
                                    Maghreb. From his experience in the U.S. he felt that this would
                                    be the most important factor in U.S. public opinion. Yazid went
                                    into some detail in describing Algerian efforts to achieve an
                                    overall detente in the Maghreb. He indicated that now that
                                    Algeria's domestic house was in better order President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> felt freer to play an
                                    active and constructive role in the Maghreb. He cited the
                                    detente between Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia; the
                                    Morocco-Mauritania rapprochement; and the defusing of Spanish
                                    Sahara as a political issue in North West Africa. He said he
                                    hoped that Algeria could be of assistance to the young Libyan
                                    government and cited a long, but rather vague, history of <gloss
                                        target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>-Libyan cooperation. The point
                                    was that Algeria was behaving responsibly in North
                                    Africa.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The third problem, Yazid said, related to the Middle East.
                                    Algeria was less concerned with the state of relations among the
                                    “major powers” than it was about the rights and security of the
                                    “little people” in the Middle East. Specifically, and in the
                                    light of Algeria's own recent history, the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was concerned about the right
                                    of Palestinians to live in peace and security. The issue of
                                    Palestine, as such, should not be overlooked in an eventual
                                    settlement. Would it be impossible for the U.S. to be more
                                    “even-handed” in dealing with the issue of Palestine and the
                                    Palestinians? Yazid's pitch was not (as Raschid Zeghar's had
                                    been in earlier conversations in Washington) for any form of
                                    support for Al Fatah or the guerrillas. Pedersen said he thought
                                    differences of opinion would undoubtedly continue on this issue,
                                    as we felt the main objective had to be establishment of peace
                                    in <pb n="3" xml:id="d17-03" facs="d17-03"/>the Middle East for
                                    all states in the Middle East area. He inquired whether Algeria
                                    would interfere if the UAR or Jordan wished to negotiate a
                                    peace. Yazid said not if it affected their own soverign
                                    concerns; if they sought to abandon the rights of the
                                    Palestinians Algeria would come to their support.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yazid reiterated what <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName>
                            had told the Secretary: that relations between Algeria and the U.S. had
                            never been better than they had been since 1967. He alluded to the
                            rapidly increasing array of mutual economic interests, adding that these
                            were giving the Algerians “options” in their attempts to reduce their
                            dependence on both France and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            manageable proportions.</p>
                        <p>Against this backdrop, Yazid said, he knew we had been troubled by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>'s nationalization of a small
                            American-owned bus company (five buses) in 1963 and by the fact that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> had taken over a house and land
                            in Algeria belonging to an American. Algeria had been unable to
                            compensate for these steps because it would have involved them in heavy
                            compensation for French owned properties.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary's inquiry about concrete steps that might be
                            taken to improve relations, Yazid noted a number of financial and other
                            steps were still required in connection with the El Paso agreement and
                            other pending matters. Investment guarantees would be useful in
                            persuading financial interests to put up the capital Algeria would
                            require as a result of the El Paso-SONATRACH agreement. Perhaps the
                            guarantees would also make it easier for the EXIM Bank to finance the
                            sale of Boeings to Air Algerie. Yazid said he had also heard that some
                            of El Paso's competitors were unhappy thatalternative sources of natural
                            gas would be entering East Coast markets. He assumed these corporations
                            would be making their case before the Federal Power Commission, and the
                            attitude of the State Department might be significant. Yazid hoped the
                            Department of State might use its good offices to help the Algerians
                            along. He said that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> would be
                            willing to talk to us about an investment guarantee agreement that would
                            be in harmony with Algerian laws.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> said that we would consider this and
                            give them a reply shortly, but pointed out that the conclusion of such
                            an agreement would be prevented by our laws in the absence of diplomatic
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that he had been
                            pleased to hear that the Algerians considered good progress to have been
                            made on the first <pb n="4" xml:id="d17-04" facs="d17-04"/>two numbered
                            points above. He had also been impressed by Yazid's description of the
                            “options” the U.S. had provided Algeria in its dealings with France and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> pointed out that these
                            “options” all appeared to have benefited Algeria more than the U.S.; he
                            could think of no comparable options that had become available to the
                            U.S. in its dealings with Algeria in the past two years. This was a
                            point the Algerians might keep in mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> added that insofar as the <gloss
                                target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> was concerned, it would be interested
                            in assurances as to the long-range reliability of supplies of natural
                            gas from Algeria. Here again the status of relations between Algeria and
                            the U.S. would be an important factor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that in his opinion
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> faced two problems:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The first was its image in the U.S. At the moment, the image was
                                not good. Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> added that many
                                Americans thought that Algeria was too frequently on the same side
                                of issues as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, for example.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that we were
                                glad that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was upgrading its
                                representation in Washington and hoped that the head of the
                                interests section would be assisted by able officers.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>There had been progress on Vietnam and in the Maghreb. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> should weigh in its own mind,
                                whether - in the context of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                                mutual interests - the issue of “Palestine for the Palestinians”
                                outweighed other considerations of importance to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>, e.g. access to American capital
                                markets, etc. The decision was one for the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                    >GOA</gloss> to make; we hoped that it was clear, however, that
                                our door was open at any time.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Yazid acknowledged the image problem and said that he would be coming to
                            Washington in the near future to consult with Congress and the Executive
                            Branch “as other lobbyists do”. He reiterated that our position on
                            Palestine was important to the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> since
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> could identify with guerrilla
                            activities in the light of its own history. (He added that the Fedayeen
                            were the only eastern Arabs who need feel no sense of humiliation, since
                            they are still fighting.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Pedersen</persName> asked whether Yazid had other concrete
                            steps to suggest. Yazid answered that he was expecting a high level
                            economist to come from Algeria in the near future. He would like to
                            bring him to Washington for discussions. Messers. Pedersen and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> assured him that all useful
                            doors would be open.</p>
                        <p>Yazid said that he would be in touch to continue the dialogue, most
                            probably in Washington</p>

                            <p>Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Houari
                                    Boumediene</persName> made an important foreign policy address
                                on October 21 at a conference of Algerian chiefs of mission, His
                                diplomats were told that, with one exception, they would all soon be
                                transferred to inaugurate a new foreign policy asserting the
                                priority of internal over external affairs. Algeria would shun the
                                example of those “progressive” regimes that had played a “vanguard”
                                role on the international scene only to collapse for internal
                                reasons.</p>
                            <p>Algeria's foreign policy priorities would henceforth be in this
                                order: “material, political, and ideological”. The main emphasis
                                would be on setting Algeria's economic and financial house in order,
                                and the performance of ambassadors' would be rated accordingly.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> said that Algerian
                                foreign policy would also be based on a number of key principles:
                                (1) independence of all foreign powers, whatever their position; (2)
                                stability, peace and non-interference in the Maghreb; (3) mutual
                                “cooperation” rather than “alms”; (4) an abhorrence of blocs,
                                military bases, and special preserves; (5) in the Middle East an
                                “escalation of armed struggle” by the Palestinians themselves -
                                which he stated somewhat defensively was not an “extremist” position
                                but simply an extension of Algeria's own independence creed; and (6)
                                continued support to Vietnam and the African liberation
                                movements.</p>

                            <p>What stands out in this speech is the emphasis on <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>'s personal philosophy of
                                concentration on internal goals. The theme had figured in earlier
                                Bournediene speeches but had never been fully woven into Algerian
                                foreign policy. Until the past year <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                    >Boumediene</persName>'s attention had been preoccupied with
                                internal problems. With these now in hand, he is free to turn more
                                to foreign affairs and to lean more in that field on his own
                                ideas.</p>
                            <p>This is an attractive refrain, since the assertion of economic
                                interests can be used to justify a bettering of relations with the
                                U.S. In any event, the downgrading of political and ideological
                                concerns may signal the emergence of a more pragmatic,
                                technocratically-oriented Algeria.</p>
                            <p>Nowhere in the October 21 speech was the U.S. attacked. The old
                                self-image of a beleaguered socialist Algeria “surrounded” by
                                hostile pro-Western states appears to have disappeared. Even the
                                sharper passages in the speech relating to the Middle East seemed
                                designed mainly to demonstrate that Algeria had not renounced its
                                revolutionary heritage.</p>
                            <p>But it was probably too much to expect that Algeria would completely
                                forsake its old ways. On October 22, <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                    >Boumediene</persName> - perhaps reacting to criticisms of his
                                previous mildness - corrected the record on the U.S. with respect
                                both to Vietnam and the Middle East. He explained that Algeria's
                                criticism of the U.S. had nothing to do with purely national
                                interests but was directed to the international role of the U.S.,
                                which he described as “hostile” to just causes. In private, the
                                Algerians now tend to tone down this kind of language, but not yet,
                                it appears, for general consumption.</p>

                                U.S.-ALGERIAN DIPLOMATIC BREAK IN 1967 IN MANNER WHICH AMOUNTED TO
                                ADMISSION THAT IT HAD BEEN A STUPID MISTAKE BUT THAT RENEWAL WITHOUT
                                SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT TO JUSTIFY IT WOULD ONLY CONFIRM ORIGINAL
                                ALGERIAN FOLLY. HE REFERRED TO VIET NAM WHERE U.S. HAD TAKEN
                                POSITIVE STEP BY ENGAGING IN PARIS MEETINGS BUT WHERE NO AGREEMENT
                                HAD YET BEEN REACHED. ON MIDDLE EAST U.S. POLICY APPEARED TO BE

                                PRO-ISRAELI NEXT. HE IMPLIED THAT NEITHER VIET NAM NOR MIDDLE EAST
                                HAD YET PROVIDED PEG ON WHICH ALGERIA COULD RENEW DIPLOMATIC

                                THAT U.S. FIRMS NOW ENJOYED A “FAVORED POSITION” HERE. ALGERIAN
                                GOVERNMENT WISHED THIS TREND TO CONTINUE SO THAT WHEN DIPLOMATIC
                                RELATIONS WERE FINALLY RESTORED THEY WOULD BE BASED ON SOMETHING
                                TANGIBLE AND ENDURING. MOST IMPORTANT FIELD OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION
                                FOR FUTURE WAS IN LIQUEFIED GAS PROJECTS, SUCH AS EL PASO DEAL. HE
                                HAD HAD LONG TALK WITH EL PASO PRESIDENT BOYD WHO WAS IN ALGIERS
                                RECENTLY AND HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY FACT THAT ORIGINAL PROJECT
                                CALLING FOR DELIVERY 10 BILLION CUBIC METERS PER YEAR AMOUNTED TO
                                ONLY 2 PERCENT OF TOTAL U.S. CONSUMPTION. BOYD HAD TOLD HIM THAT
                                PROSPECTS WERE GOOD THAT SALES COULD BE EXTENDED AN ADDITIONAL 5

                                PURPOSE OF HIS CALLING ME IN, WAS FINANCING OF ALGERIA'S SHARE OF

                                SECRETARY HAD “PROMISED TO BE HELPFUL IN SUCH MATTERS”. HE NOTED

                                WISHED ME TO CONVEY TO DEPARTMENT AND SECRETARY HIS REQUEST FOR
                                THEIR SUPPORT. HE ALSO WONDERED WHETHER THE <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"

                                LARGE AND COMPLEX MATTER REQUIRING A NUMBER OF SOURCES MANY OF WHICH
                                WOULD BE PRIVATE. I REFERRED TO WIDESPREAD IMPRESSION THAT ALGERIAN

                                PERSONALLY SUGGESTED THAT SMAIL HAMDANI ACT AS SPECIAL LIAISON ON
                                SUCH MATTERS SINCE HAMDANI HAD CLOSE CONTACTS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH

                            <item>Department continues to favor expansion commercial relations with
                                Algeria. It has become increasingly clear, however, that our ability
                                to encourage this relationship by positive acts is likely to be
                                limited by lack of progress toward settlement of outstanding claims
                                of American nationals against Algeria and disputes with American
                                corporations. We have on several occasions tried to make this clear
                                to <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>, most recently in Secretary's
                                message to <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> (State
                                032269). We wish to avoid giving Algerians impression our moves are
                                related only to EL PASO project or that we are pressing them too
                                hard. At same time, we consider <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                    >Bouteflika</persName>'s request that the Secretary facilitate

                            <item>We are hopeful that SONATRACH President <persName corresp="#p_GA1"
                                    >Ghozali</persName>'s recent statements to Gibson (Algiers 592
                                and 595) indicate Algerian awareness of desirability of reaching
                                settlement with oil companies. Department suggests you seek early
                                meeting with Ghozali to explore his approach including status of
                                disputes with American oil companies mentioned <gloss
                                    target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>s. Further, you should make
                                clear to Ghozali that statement which <pb n="2" xml:id="d21-02"

                                settlement of disputes will probably have to await Govt to Govt

                                Department policy. We believe the sooner progress can be shown
                                toward settlement of claims and disputes the better. Absence of
                                diplomatic relations need not delay this effort. Recent

                        <p>You will recall greeting FRANK BORMAN in San Clemente upon his return
                            from the POW mission to world capitals as your personal emissary. Borman
                            has told us of his extremely cordial and friendly reception in Algiers
                            where he met both with President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName>. It is our understanding
                            that Borman's stop in Algeria was, in fact, the highlight of his
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>He reports that: <list>

                                        >Boumediene</persName> expressed interest in being helpful
                                    but felt that the opposition considers the prisoners their trump
                                    card at the Paris negotiations. However, Foreign Minister
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> promised
                                    to raise the question during a forthcoming trip to Hanoi.</item>
                                <item>— On the Mid-East situation, both leaders made these points in
                                    a lengthy discussion:</item>
                                <item>— The <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> Plan was a
                                    good first step but a Palestinian role will have to be taken
                                    into consideration.</item>
                                <item>— A U.S. presence is definitely needed to offset Soviet
                                    intrusion into the area.</item>
                                <item>— There is nothing specific troubling US-Algerian relations
                                    except the overall Mid-East context which prevented resumption
                                    of formal relations at this time. [<persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                        >Bouteflika</persName> went so far as to say that the
                                    Algerians would like to find a “political hook” on which to hang
                                    resumption.]</item>
                                <item>— Economic cooperation between our two nations was flourishing
                                    and <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> hoped that
                                    economic, <pb n="2" xml:id="d22-02" facs="d22-02"/>technical and
                                    commercial ties would expand.</item>
                                <item>— President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>
                                    extended his best wishes to you.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>State feels that Borman's reception—in the absence of diplomatic
                            relations—was noteworthy and recommends that you send a note of thanks
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> for his hospitality
                            to Borman as a way of keeping the lines open to the Algerian leader.</p>
                        <p>There is also a related action. Presidential confidant, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZR1">Rachid Zeghar</persName>, who performs liaison
                            functions with our Interests Section in Algeria and who helped to
                            arrange Borman's visit, gave Borman some gifts—for you, a dagger which
                            belonged to Algeria's most famous 19th century figure, Emir Abdelkadar,
                            and for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Julie two
                            intricately woven brocade gowns from Constantine. These gifts should be
                            acknowledged, although it will be difficult for you to send a letter to
                            Zeghar if you do not send one to President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The issue is whether you wish to capitalize on the opportunity that the
                            POW reception for Borman presents to keep an open door to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. By all accounts, the
                            Algerians went out their way to make Borman's layover a success and they
                            seized the opportunity to express interest in improving ties with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our relationship with Algeria at the moment is primarily a
                            pragmatic, economic one. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> has categorically stated that his primary
                            interest is in economic development. He is anxious to have greater
                            access to U.S. energy markets, capital resources and technology, and
                            commercial ties with the U.S. have flourished even in the absence of
                            diplomatic relations. It can be assumed that the main interest in
                            resuming relations would be to improve access to the U.S. for commercial
                            reasons, rather than for any shift in political ideology. Most recently,
                            we have reports that the Algerians are sending small arms resupply to
                            the Palestinian fedayeen, and there is little to suggest that they will
                            not continue ideological and practical support for so-called liberation
                            movements of all kinds, including the Black Panthers. It is interesting
                            to note, nevertheless, that they have just recently upgraded their
                            Interests Section here in Washington. However, the Head of our Interests
                            Section who is here on consultation <pb n="3" xml:id="d22-03"
                                facs="d22-03"/>does not overrate the chances for resumption of
                            relations in the near future.</p>
                        <p>With reference to <persName corresp="#p_ZR1">Rachid Zeghar</persName>'s
                            gifts, they were not apparent as part of the official Algerian
                            reception. Two letters—to <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZR1"
                                >Zeghar</persName>—might have the effect of diluting the first. A
                            single letter to <persName corresp="#p_ZR1">Zeghar</persName> would be
                            awkward. Lucy Ferguson would have no problem acknowledging the gifts
                            through her channels.</p>

                                Secretary then expressed belief that US policy in Middle East had

                            </p>
                            <p>Algeria is the most dynamic and important nation of North Africa. It
                                has a young aggressive leadership that appears determined to
                                maintain Algeria's political independence from any major power,
                                while drawing pragmatically on outside capital and technology to
                                exploit its natural resources and develop the country. This approach
                                has led rapidly to a substantial improvement in U.S.-Algerian
                                relations, both political and economic. We see our broad interests
                                well served if this trend continues. Algeria has settled
                                satisfactorily the compensation claims of American corporations, and
                                is actively reviewing the private American claims. There is now a
                                potentially very large market for U.S. technology and capital in
                                Algeria. As the economy expands, significant private U.S. investment
                                opportunities in the form of joint partnerships should develop.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. demands for fuel energy are outpacing supply, and the
                                contemplated El Paso-SONATRACH project for the importation Algerian
                                gas will play a significant role over the next twenty years. We also
                                see this project, of such importance to the Algerians, as
                                associating them closely with western (specifically U.S.) economic
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>It is not in our interest to work actively to undermine the historic
                                French position in Algeria. France itself is too important for us to
                                attempt anything so antagonistic and, despite their troubles; the
                                remaining ties of the French with Algeria cannot easily be broken.
                                Realistically, however, we expect the Algerians to move away from
                                the French (as they are already doing in the critical petroleum
                                sector). We do see it to be in our interests to fill, at least in
                                part, a vacuum left by the French in this strategically,
                                economically and politically important North African and
                                Mediterranean country. We consider a close relationship with the
                                countries of Western Europe, and not to turn to the Soviet
                                Union.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>There is general agreement that the U.S. will require natural gas
                                imports from foreign sources to meet future requirements, that U. S.
                                exports will benefit from the project (Ex-Im has already approved a
                                preliminary commitment of $256.5 million for construction of
                                facilities for the project in Algeria), and that it would improve
                                relations with Algeria while reducing Soviet influence and
                                strengthening elements within Algeria who favor closer ties with the
                                U.S. The security risk of depending on foreign supplies is minimal,
                                since these imports from Algeria represent only about 1.5 percent of
                                U.S. consumption, a large number of foreign sources are being
                                actively considered as future sources of natural gas, gas is not
                                essential to our military machine, and domestic gas by virtue of its
                                lower price will be favored over foreign gas.</p>
                            <p>The major issue concerns the question of Algeria expropriation of
                                foreign property, both U.S. and non-U.S. After discussing the
                                expropriation problem with Secretary Connally you directed that we
                                hold up on this project. However, I now believe that the
                                expropriation issue should not stand in the way of our approval.

                                    claims remain unresolved; but Algeria has indicated a

                                    for six or seven weeks, that State Department would have to give

                                clearly in charge of Algeria. His regime has no credible challengers

                                His departure from the scene could bring on considerable political
                                uncertainty. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> will
                                continue pressing his policies of state ownership or control of all
                                major economic enterprises in Algeria, and of developing heavy

                            <item>Out of interest and sentiment, Algeria remains non-aligned and

                                the Palestinian issue does arouse strong feelings in Algeria; in
                                times of an acute Arab-Israeli crisis (as in June 1967) the
                                government might feel compelled to take at least temporary action
                                against Israel's supporters even at the expense of Algeria's own

                                the Algerians allowed themselves to come under strong influence from

                            <item>A substantial oil producer, Algeria will continue to rely on
                                rising oil revenues to pay for its increasingly expensive
                                development projects. Its February 1971 partial nationalization of
                                two French oil companies (the only large foreign-owned concerns left
                                in Algeria) promises Algeria increased income from its petroleum.
                                Though this move set off a fairly serious crisis with the French,
                                tensions are now receding. An accord has been reached with one
                                French company and, over time, probably will be with the other one
                                as well.</item>

                            <item>But Algeria's best hopes for added income probably lie in its
                                mostly unexploited natural gas reserves, which are among the three
                                or four largest in the world. Its first effort to export major
                                quantities of natural gas has been its agreement with the El Paso
                                Natural Gas Company of the US. If this is approved, the Algerians
                                would begin shipping gas to the US in the mid- or late-1970s, and
                                would initially receive about $120 million a year in new export
                                earnings. Algeria probably sees this as but a beginning and will
                                push for further foreign gas sales.</item>

                                its small population and its newness as a nation would seem to
                                warrant. This has resulted, at least in large part, from the actions
                                of an aggressive and intensely nationalistic leadership which has
                                decolonized and socialized the country's economy, adroitly played
                                off several of the great powers for his own benefit, and given loud
                                verbal and some material support to insurgencies in various parts of

                            <item>The Algerian commitment to a non-aligned international posture
                                seems to run deep, yet its attitude toward the US will also continue
                                to be conditioned by its irritation over the US stance in the
                                Arab-Israeli conflict. Such factors, along with the Algerian
                                Government's record of extremely tough dealings with foreign oil
                                companies, raise questions both about the general course of
                                US-Algerian relations over the next several years and about
                                Algeria's long-term reliability as an energy supplier for the US and

                                dictatorial regime, albeit not a very tyrannical one. Long the chief
                                of the armed forces, he seized power from Ahmed Ben Bella in 1885.
                                Since then he has consolidated his power, purged his opponents,

                                figure. His authority derives not from mass popularity but from the
                                well equipped, well paid, and loyal Algerian military and security
                                establishment, particularly the 60,000-man army.</item>

                                control. Until Independence, Algeria was dominated—politically,
                                socially, and economically—by the French. The 1962-1963 exodus of 90
                                percent of the million French residents of Algeria meant the
                                abandonment of their prosperous their government sinecures, and many
                                of their commercial enterprises to their former subjects. But a
                                number of factories, businesses, mines, oil operations, and other
                                enterprises continued under French and to a lesser extent other
                                foreign ownership. Since 1965, virtually all of these have been
                                taken over and are now being run by the Algerians' themselves.<note

                                    has shown little interest in socializing the properties of those
                                    relatively few affluent Algerian professional men, estate

                                    French. This hands-off policy appears to be changing, however.
                                    For example, an agrarian reform law just published calls for the

                            <item>Beyond ending foreign ownership and control, the regime has
                                ambitious long-term plans for the development of the nation's
                                economy, which has a mix of weaknesses and strengths. On the minus
                                side, Algeria has a problem of population pressure on available
                                arable land—a problem exacerbated by a very high birth rate.
                                (Population is now 14 million people; the rate of increase is 3.1
                                percent a year.) Unemployment is extensive both in the cities and
                                rural areas. Most Algerians are still poor farmers, dependent on the
                                weather for the growth of enough wheat to feed themselves. Nearly
                                all the best agricultural land had been taken over by French
                                settlers, who made most of it into large estates producing wheat,
                                citrus fruit, and wine for the metropole. These properties are now
                                operated by the ex-employees of the departed owners along with
                                recently arrived war veterans and land-less peasants; management
                                standards, productivity, output, and personal incomes of the farmers
                                themselves have all dropped sharply. Further, the former protected
                                French market for wine has been cut off, and many Algerian vineyards
                                are being slowly converted to the production of other crops.</item>

                            <item>Though agriculture is the occupation of most Algerians, it is a
                                matter of fairly low priority to the government, which continues to
                                allocate limited resources to it. Rather, the regime is out to
                                develop heavy industry on a large-scale, and has many of the assets
                                needed for such an effort. Besides having a highly developed
                                infrastructure inherited from colonial days, the country is rich in
                                exportable mineral resources: principally oil, natural gas, and some
                                iron ore. Algeria's gas reserves are large, but only a fairly small
                                amount has so far been exported. Petroleum is another matter;
                                Algeria is an important world oil producer. Its income from the sale
                                of oil reached some $650 million in hard currency in 1970 (71
                                percent of its export earnings). This has enabled the regime both to
                                build up foreign exchange reserves of several hundred million
                                dollars, and to begin work on an ambitious scheme designed, perhaps
                                over two or more decades, to make Algeria an affluent industrial
                                power. This effort will be extremely expensive; it will require ever
                                larger imports of costly capital goods which in turn will depend on
                                the receipt of more and more foreign exchange. Greatly enhanced
                                export earnings over present levels, along with fairly strict
                                austerity at home to restrain import levels, will be needed to carry
                                out such a program.</item>

                            <item>The <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> regime has
                                been actively pursuing these policies over the past few years. A
                                general belt tightening and higher taxes have been imposed. Private
                                foreign travel is discouraged. Strict controls over imports of
                                consumers goods are in effect. A number of import substitution
                                industries, such as textiles, have been built. Efforts to get more
                                petroleum revenues from—or in spite of—the French <pb n="6"
                                    xml:id="d27-06" facs="d27-06"/>have been pursued with tenacity.
                                With the proposed El Paso agreement to export natural gas to the US,
                                efforts to earn large sums from Algeria's rich gas deposits have
                                    begun.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn16">Paragraphs 34-48 below
                                    discuss the El Paso project in detail.</note> Ten to 15 percent
                                of current oil earnings are being plowed back into exploration for
                                more revenue yielding oil reserves, and for the construction of more
                                pipelines. The principal planned industrial projects now underway, a
                                steel mill and three petrochemical complexes, are designed not to
                                provide many new jobs, but to bring in new export earnings and to
                                provide further import substitutes. Concentrated government efforts
                                in these fairly limited areas have led the overall Algerian economy
                                to grow at a statistical rate of 5-6 percent a year, despite the
                                poor performance in the agricultural sector and the continued low
                                living standards of most of the people.</item>

                            <item>Algeria continues to proclaim itself a socialist state, but it is
                                an unusual one. In practice, it is developing something akin to
                                capitalism. Government corporations, with varying efficiency, now
                                operate such specific sectors of economic activity as mining,
                                textiles, and petroleum—in all of which they have a monopoly. With
                                the limits of basic central government policies, each corporation is
                                more or less autonomous. The best known and most effective of these
                                is SONATRACH, the state corporation responsible for petroleum and
                                natural gas. Developed by the able Belaid Abdesselam, now the
                                Minister of Industry and Energy, SONATRACH has shown itself capable
                                of handling all aspects of the petroleum industry, including
                                exploration, extraction, refining and marketing. In these efforts
                                they have had extensive help from hired foreign advisors including
                                Americans. It is too early to tell whether SONATRACH will retain its
                                present high standards, or whether other state corporations will
                                come to approach them. If they do, such competent management would
                                be of great assistance in achieving Algerian development
                                goals.</item>

                                political apathy prevalent since the end of the independence war.
                                The government's long-term development program, even with the
                                austerity it entails, appears to have fairly general acquiescence,
                                save for the small but hard pressed middle class. Nonetheless, the
                                Algerian regime—no matter how stable it now appears—remains a
                                vulnerable one. The marginal living standards of most of its
                                farmers, the gross lack of employment opportunities, the additional
                                hardships imposed on the people by the development program, the
                                presence of a small educated bourgeoisie chafing under rule by
                                hardnosed, socialist army officers add up to the potential for
                                expressions of mass public unrest. There is no way of predicting if
                                or when popular explosions might occur, but they cannot be ruled
                                out.</item>

                                been promulgated. Some controlled local and regional elections have
                                been held, but there have been no national ones. There is a single
                                official political party, the National Liberation (FLN), and it is
                                seeking to reorganize and strengthen itself, but the FLN is so
                                inherently weak and subordinate to the government as to make it a

                                play the major role in ruling the country; they might institute some
                                form of collegial rule. But without Boumdiene's strong direction,
                                splits—brought on both by ideological and personal differences—and
                                infighting could easily develop over time. Indeed, there are already
                                reports of disputes among the top leadership; at least one minister
                                is alleged to oppose the regime's austerity measures. <persName

                                inclined both by interest and sentiment to avoid alignment with any
                                of the Great Powers. Rather, it normally seeks, in the classic Third

                                for its own benefit, and it has become quite skilled in doing so. At
                                the same time it stubbornly resists efforts of outsiders to

                                    cordiality. China provides virtually no economic or military aid

                                received, the Algerians believe that basically, it was because of

                                independence. Innately suspicious of outsiders anyway, and not

                                felt impelled, though probably reluctantly, to impose a temporary

                                military and economic involvement is negligible. In 1967 it did send
                                a small military force to join the Egyptians along the Suez Canal,
                                but withdrew these troops in 1970 when the Israeli cease-fire
                                provided an excuse. Algeria does provide Palestinian guerrillas with
                                arms, training, and verbal support—much as Arab countries far from
                                the battlefield aided it in its own war of independence. Otherwise,
                                the Algerian leaders publicly and privately express a low opinion of

                            <item>Algerian policy toward the rest of the Third World is partly a
                                function of geographical proximity. Tunisia and Morocco have loomed
                                quite large, beginning with the early 1960s, when relations with
                                both were seriously strained by mutual suspicions and as a
                                consequence of Moroccan and Tunisian claims on large parts of
                                Algeria. In 1963, Morocco bested Algeria in a brief border war;
                                relations were tense throughout the area during much of the 1960s.
                                Subsequently, for a variety of reasons including the shelving of the
                                border claims and a gradual appreciation of their common interests,
                                the situation has greatly eased. Relations have so improved that the
                                three countries now envisage such modest cooperative ventures as a
                                joint international airline. Though unforeseeable incidents could
                                change this picture, Algeria's relations with Tunisia and Morocco
                                seem likely to remain fairly placid. Wealthier, having no
                                territorial claims against its neighbors, possessing the most
                                powerful military force in the area, Algeria now sees little threat
                                in the Maghreb, and maintains good bilateral relations with all its
                                neighbors. These circumstances will permit Algeria to concentrate on
                                its own parochial problems, though it will continue to give lip
                                service to the idea of some loose federation of the Maghreb states,
                                and will hope eventually to become the dominant state in the
                                area.</item>

                                relations with the Soviets were established, but little else. But as
                                BEN BELLA proclaimed himself a socialist revolutionary and an
                                ideologue somewhat on the Castro model, a thaw ensued and the
                                Soviets extended large offers of economic aid. When Algeria's
                                ill-equipped army came off second best against the Moroccans in the
                                fall of 1963; BEN BELLA turned to Moscow for military supplies and
                                got a quick and gratifying response. By 1964, Algeria was being
                                vigorously lauded in the Russian media; BEN BELLA was accorded a
                                hero's welcome in Moscow and ties became quite close. BEN BELLA's
                                ouster in 1965 did not immediately change the appearance of things;
                                the Maghreb was engaged then and for some years in a cold war of its
                                own. The Soviets were accused of, or suspected to be supporting
                                Algeria in its quarrels with Morocco and Tunisia; the US came in for
                                similar accusations about backing Algeria's hostile neighbor. An
                                image of Algeria was publicized by some of its enemies depicting it

                                million in military assistance, including a $100 million agreement
                                signed in February 1971. The Algerian Armed Forces are almost

                                show a marked preference for Western equipment and know-how. The
                                Algerians have sought to limit their dependence on Soviet military
                                support by buying small amounts of such French equipment as jet
                                trainers and by arranging for military training programs in France
                                and to a smaller degree in other West European countries—<pb n="10"

                                of room and board—may be waning. To our knowledge, Algeria supports
                                and subsides none of their activity against their respective
                                homelands. Rather it has viewed some, such as Dr. <persName>Timothy

                                to one million barrels per day (bpd). The value of this oil is

                                dead. According to the French, this meant that over time Algeria
                                would no longer be given special privileges (particularly as
                                contrasted with Tunisia and Morocco) with respect to immigration

                                impact was the termination of a $65 million a year financial aid
                                program. Further, the French Government gave up responsibility for

                                80 percent). Nevertheless, an eventual accord with ERAP now seems

                                    Frenchmen refuse to accept. Serving as a safety valve for the

                                technicians are in Algeria. Politically the two are not likely to be

                            <item>A number of issues will continue to trouble US-Algerian relations.
                                These include Algerian resentment of US supply of military equipment
                                to France during the independence war, Algerian dislike of most US
                                foreign policies, the nationalization of US firms in Algeria, the
                                sharply differing ideological outlooks of the two countries, normal
                                Algerian suspicions of foreigners, and safe haven given exiles from
                                the US. But this again is not the complete picture. Determined to
                                increase their export earnings, the Algerians have evidently
                                concluded that the US, of all the developed countries, offers the
                                most sophisticated skills and the highest quality equipment needed
                                to develop and operate complex modern projects. And of course they
                                see the US as a source of development capital and as a potentially
                                lucrative market for exports of Algerian natural gas. Thus despite a
                                good deal of harsh rhetoric, a number of steps have been taken over
                                the past few years which have put US-Algerian relations on a more
                                amicable basis than before.</item>

                                been hired, mostly by SONATRACH but also by other state corporations
                                and the government. Much sophisticated US equipment is being
                                imported. Several joint ventures, with an Algerian state corporation
                                holding 51 percent of the shares and a US firm 49 percent, have come
                                into operation. These include such schemes as construction of an
                                elaborate computer center and various advanced oil exploration
                                projects. The cumulative value of these projects is not negligible.

                                related to the petroleum industry. In 1969 Algeria imported about

                                and negotiation of the proposed El Paso project, which would provide
                                substantial quantities of Algerian natural gas to the American
                                market by the mid- or late-1970s. If finally approved, it would
                                entail total investment (at 1970 prices) of about $1.2 billion, with
                                the costs split about evenly between SONATRACH and the El Paso
                                Natural Gas Company, SONATRACH, with loan and credit guarantees from
                                the US Export-Import Bank amounting to $285 million, would build a
                                huge gas liquefaction plant and a pipeline to the Hassi R'Mel gas
                                field. The latter is a sizeable one; even with the large volumes
                                contemplated, only about 10 percent of it would be exploited. El
                                Paso would order from 6 to 9 specially built liquid natural gas
                                    (<gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss>) tankers, and construct
                                facilities on the east coast of the US to reconvert the <gloss

                                receiving about $120 million a year in export earnings from it. But
                                of course the agreement would imply making the US a much larger

                                restoring diplomatic relations with the US is an open question;
                                there are reasons for and against their taking such a step. A
                                diplomatic relationship would enable each side more fully to staff
                                its embassies, and thus facilitate further commercial transactions.
                                But the two powers retain Interest Sections in the respective
                                capitals which have become embassies in everything but the formal
                                trappings of protocol. They provide—as the El Paso negotiations have
                                shown—adequate means for the two countries to deal with each other.
                                Further, the break in 1967 was essentially a symbolic protest
                                against US Middle Eastern policy; in Algerian eyes, the latter has
                                changed but little. Other Arab countries that broke relations with
                                the US in 1967 have not made any move to restore them. For all their
                                independence of, and sense of superiority to, other Arabs, the
                                Algerians are likely to be wary about taking such a conspicuous
                                first step, particularly if it seemed to be part of a single
                                commercial project. But, over time, particularly if other economic
                                ties should grow, the prospects of restoring diplomatic relations
                                would be enhanced as a result of the El Paso deal.</item>

                            <item>Disapproval of the El Paso operation would, of course, bring forth
                                angry reactions. Just how angry, and just what concrete steps would
                                follow would depend to some extent on the manner in which the
                                rejection was announced. If done in such a way as to lead the
                                Algerians to believe they were being insulted or blackballed for
                                political reasons, the reaction could be fiery, at least in a verbal
                                sense. And a rejection would almost inevitably be ascribed to
                                political motives. Other than the Interests Section itself—which
                                might be expelled if the Algerians felt provoked enough—there are
                                virtually no tangible US assets available for the government to
                                seize as reprisals. The several hundred American specialists
                                employed by SONATRACH might receive some personal harassment, but
                                being “unofficial” they are not likely to be expelled. The Algerians
                                would probably denounce the US in such organizations as OPEC and
                                throughout the Arab world. Radical oil producers in that area, e,g.,
                                Iraq and Libya, would be sympathetic to Algerian complaints, but
                                rejection of the El Paso project would probably not in itself lead
                                them to take any new immediate anti-American steps.</item>

                                French. The ever wary Algerians suspect Paris of plotting to kill
                                the El Paso deal, both to keep the Americans out of their sphere of
                                influence and to punish the Algerians for their recent anti-French
                                acts. Though the great bulk of French properties have already been
                                taken over, there are still enough French interests—e.g., their
                                remaining 49 percent holdings in the oil companies and their large
                                export market in Algeria—to make them more vulnerable than others to
                                retaliatory actions. Whether the Algerians would actually retaliate
                                against the French is essentially unpredictable, but would <pb

                            <item>Incentives for the Algerians to continue shipments of gas to the
                                US, even in time of severe political stress, are strong, and likely
                                to get stronger over the years. Algeria needs the money, and as time
                                passes it will need it even more. Despite its oil revenues, it is
                                not just another rich Mideastern oil producer; it has 18 times the
                                population of Kuwait, while producing only a quarter to a third as
                                much oil. Unlike Kuwait, Libya, Abu Dhabi, and other wealthy Arab
                                mini-states, Algeria has not and cannot pile up huge foreign
                                exchange reserves simply because it lacks ways of usefully spending
                                the money. From an economic point of view, Algeria's situation is
                                more like that of Iran; it is committed to spending ever more on
                                increasingly costly development schemes.<note n="11"
                                    xml:id="d27fn25">Like Algeria, Iran has a fairly large
                                    population and promising economic potential. Iran embarked an
                                    expensive economic development program long before Algeria did.
                                    This is now well along, has so far been successful but has
                                    become increasingly costly. Levels of exchange reserves are low;
                                    indeed foreign indebtedness is increasing. Ever more strongly
                                    committed to the program, the Iranian Government is both
                                    endlessly wrangling for more money while showing great care not
                                    to bring about even a temporary halt in income.</note> As
                                projects get further along, it will become more and more difficult
                                for Algeria to do without the regular increment of funds needed to
                                continue them; it is easier to discard plans for a steel mill than
                                to abandon it three-quarters completed. This would almost certainly
                                remain the case even if the present or a future Algerian regime were
                                to shift its priorities from building heavy industry to promoting
                                employment through subsidized labor intensive industries; any
                                economic plan aimed at boosting living standards will require very
                                substantial funding.</item>

                            <item>Further, natural gas is Algeria's real hope for greatly increased
                                revenues over the next several decades. Geological surveys to date
                                indicate that it will not be able to rival countries like Venezuela
                                or Saudi Arabia in volume of petroleum produced. But Algeria may
                                very well become the world's principal exporter of gas; over the
                                longer term both the amounts extracted and the revenues received may
                                become very great indeed. One of the important prerequisites for
                                bringing this about is to make the product attractive enough to
                                generate a rising demand for it and to attract the huge amounts of
                                capital necessary to exploit it. Such Algerians as Belaid Abdesselam
                                (and very probably Boumediene) are well aware that playing politics
                                with gas sales is not the way to lure more customers.</item>

                                discussed above an element in Algerian thinking—the intense
                                anti-Israeli sentiments—which could motivate Algerian actions
                                harming it as much or more than the targets of its ire.
                                Specifically, Algeria could, in the heat of an Arab-Israeli crisis,
                                ban the export of natural gas to the US.<note n="12"

                                doctrinaire leader like BEN BELLA <pb n="16" xml:id="d27-16"

                                than the more practical Boumediene. The degree of damage the
                                Algerians believed they could inflict on the US and El Paso by an
                                embargo would also be a factor. The very nature of the El Paso
                                project is such that there is almost nothing in that country owned
                                by El Paso which the government could seize, other than say office
                                furniture and automobiles. Nor with El Paso owning and controlling
                                most if not all the <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> tankers,
                                could the Algerian Government arbitrarily divert gas shipments
                                elsewhere. If it thought such an act would impose real damage on the
                                American economy, it might be more inclined to take such a step than
                                if it believed the US had alternative sources of supply available or
                                would suffer only minor inconveniences.</item>

                            <item>To sum up, we cannot entirely rule out—in times of
                                crisis—irrational, impetuous acts by the Algerian Government against
                                US economic interests in general and the El Paso Natural Gas Company
                                in particular. But even if such moves were undertaken, they would be
                                more likely than not to be of short duration; economic incentives to
                                resume would reassert themselves once the political purposes of an
                                embargo had been assured. In general, however, the Algerians are
                                likely to be a reliable commercial partner if a deal is made.
                                Indeed, because of small foreign exchange reserves and probable
                                increasing dependence on additional revenues from gas sales, Algeria
                                is less likely than most other Arab producers of hydro-carbons to
                                impose a long-term embargo on the US.<note n="13" xml:id="d27fn27"

                                    live on the interest it would draw. Algeria cannot, for decades
                                    at least, hope to be in a comparable position.</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Algerians have approached Raytheon about purchasing an air defense
                            communications network. For Raytheon to do this would involve items from
                            the Munitions Control List for which Algeria is ineligible according to
                            present policy—not by law—because it does not have diplomatic relations
                            with the US. The question is whether we would accept Algeria from the
                            ban for this project. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> recommends we do so, but seeks your concurrence
                            (attached).</p>
                        <p>What is involved is a $60-$80 million air defense network, essentially a
                            radar system for all purposes including military. It is not an offensive
                            system and no weapons would be involved—although obviously the net
                            effect would be to improve Algeria's defense capability. The British,
                            French and Italians are also interested.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">The immediate operational question stems from the
                                fact that the sale would have to include items from the Munitions
                                List. Raytheon does not want to go ahead and prepare an offer
                                without an understanding that the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> is prepared to exempt Algeria from the ban in this
                                case. There is no legal inhibition; this would be strictly a policy
                                decision. Raytheon will also need financing, but State has
                                discouraged them from thinking about any <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> assistance which is prohibited by law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The broader issue is whether we want to take another step towards
                            developing a presence outside the framework of formal political ties in
                            the Mid East.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">The Arguments</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the pro side, such a project would give us the first contact with the
                            Algerian military since the 1967 break in relations and would dilute the
                            Soviet position as the sole supplier of the Algerian air force. There
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d29-02" facs="d29-02"/>would be advantage in a
                            pragmatic broadening of our relationship with an important Arab state
                            and no significant impact on the Arab-Israeli military balance because
                            Algeria is so far from an active Arab-Israeli military front. Also among
                            the advantages are the gain to US industry and the further broadening of
                            the American technological and commercial presence in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">On the other hand</hi>, there is the argument that
                            we do not see eye-to-eye on issues like Vietnam—although they have been
                            helpful on the prisoner question—or the Palestine question. There is
                            also the fact that Americans would be involved in helping Algeria
                            strengthen its military defenses—with some effect on our friends in
                            Tunisia and Morocco. The Secretary would propose briefing the Israelis
                            at an appropriate time, putting it in the perspective that it is in our
                            mutual interests to have an entree to the Algerian military and some
                            leverage on the Soviet position there.</p>
                        <p>On balance, it seems to me that the US has an interest in developing a
                            presence in the area which can supplement inter-governmental relations
                            when they are at low ebb as now. In this connection, we have encouraged
                            the private sector to look for opportunities. Raytheon's opportunity is
                            one such case. Algeria is potentially one of the leaders of that area,
                            and we have encouraged increasing—albeit commercial—ties with it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">RECOMMENDATION:</hi> That no objection be posed to

                        <p>Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">David Newsom</persName>, has accepted a
                            long-standing invitation to visit Algeria later this month. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> (Tab B) recommends
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> carry a letter from
                            you to President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. The
                            letter (Tab A) expresses your satisfaction in the growing contacts
                            between Algeria and the US, notes that it is in our common interests to
                            continue this trend and concludes with the general observation that this
                            complements our efforts toward better understanding among nations around
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>Algerian-US relations have developed over the last few years primarily
                            through substantial commercial exchange. While the Algerians have not
                            abandoned their philosophical positions on such issues as the
                            Palestinian revolution and Vietnam, Boumediene's pragmatic interest in
                            developing Algeria has made possible a foundation for relating to the US
                            in areas—primarily economic—matching Algeria's needs. Out of this and
                            despite political differences has grown a series of relationships over
                            the last two years. Astronaut FRANK BORMAN's visit was one highlight;
                            you and President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> have
                            exchanged various greetings; and you have sent your foreign policy
                            report to him. A letter from you carried by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> would appropriately fit in the context of this
                            already existing—albeit limited—series of exchanges.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of his visit to Algeria, I have asked Assistant Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to convey to you
                            my best personal wishes and my feeling of satisfaction with the
                            favorable trend in relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Those relations rest on a firm foundation of interests common to Algeria
                            and to the United States. For this reason, they hold the promise of
                            substantial benefits for both the Algerian and American people. I
                            believe our governments have shown what can be done to promote
                            advantageous cooperation and contacts despite differences in social
                            systems and policies.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United States is also engaged in major efforts to
                            encourage understanding and cooperation in other areas of the world.
                            Such efforts are essential to building the more stable world all of us
                            want.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. President, my warm regards and best wishes for the
                            prosperity of Algeria and of the Algerian people.</p>

                                THEY CANNOT GIVE WAY ON THAT SINCE IT IS “THEIR ONLY CARD” TO BRING

                                MAJOR FACTOR WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO RESUMPTION RELATIONS.
                                RENEWAL WITH YEMEN IS ALSO HELPFUL IN LONG RUN THOUGH ALGERIANS
                                WOULD NOT WANT ANY DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT RENEWAL AND THEIR
                                OWN, AND HENCE IT MIGHT WEIGH AGAINST IMMEDIATE ALGERIAN RENEWAL.
                                MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ALGERIANS, WHO ARE EVER MINDFUL OF THEIR
                                REPUTATION IN THIRD WORLD, WILL BE CURRENT HEIGHTENED MILITARY
                                ACTIVITY IN INDOCHINA. IDEAL TIMING FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW WOULD
                                PROBABLY BE A FEW MONTHS HENCE WHEN EL PASO PROJECT IS UNDERWAY AND
                                WHEN MILITARY ACTIVITY IN INDOCHINA MIGHT HAVE BEEN REDUCED. I
                                MENTIONED TO HAMDANI THAT ASSTSEC NEWSOM WAS PREPARED TO COME TO
                                ALGERIA. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">HAMDANI</persName> DID NOT GIVE
                                DIRECT REPLY, BUT I BELIEVE FROM WHAT HE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT HE
                                WOULD NOT WANT TO RISK “FAILURE” OF SUCH A MISSION AND THEREFORE
                                WOULD WANT IT ONLY IF DECISION TO RENEW RELATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN
                                MADE. IN SUCH CASE, I BELIEVE NEWSOM'S VISIT TO ALGERIA JUST BEFORE
                                AND DURING SECRETARY'S VISIT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN PROVIDING LATEST

                                avoid imprisonment for an assault conviction, Eldridge Cleaver,
                                Minister of Information for the Black Panthers, founded a
                                headquarters in Algeria. On June 3, two Black Panthers had demanded
                                and received $500,000 in ransom after hijacking a Western Airlines
                                flight, a sum which the government of Algeria returned to the
                                airline. The Government then released the hijackers to the Black
                                Panthers in Algiers.</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> thanked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> for coming in to talk to him
                            about this new and extremely serious incident. He wanted to say - first
                            of all, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not wish to
                            negotiate with Algeria on this subject. It was obvious that we had no
                            control over the aircraft which was presently en route from Miami to
                            Boston; it's ultimate destination presumably being Algiers. The
                            passengers had been let off, $1 million ransom collected. There were
                            three men, two women and three children involved in the hijacking
                            group.</p>
                        <p>We did not intend to ask Algeria any question on what would be done if
                            the plane landed in Algeria. We felt that if there is any responsibility
                            anywhere it lies in the fact that Algeria did give asylum to the
                            previous hijackers—a fact which was widely circulated by the press—and a
                            statement <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>was recently issued
                            by the Panthers <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> in Algiers, and picked
                            up by the US press, containing encouragement to carry out similar
                            acts.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question about Algerian responsibility concerning the
                            life of the crew and the safety of the aircraft. This is clearly a
                            national responsibility under the terms of the Chicago convention which
                            Algeria has signed.</p>
                        <p>Speaking now as a friend, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, and one who has served and worked hard and long
                            to improve relations between the US and Algeria, he could not
                            over-emphasize the seriousness with which this second incident is viewed
                            at the highest level of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> nor the
                            effect that its outcome will have on the progress of our relations.</p>
                        <p>We have to consider—many people in this country will indeed feel this
                            way—that encouragements are being given to commit similar acts and that
                            this constitutes a direct intervention into the domestic affairs of the
                            U.S. No country is more conscious than Algeria of what intervention into
                            one's domestic affairs means.</p>
                        <p>We were not suggesting any conditions nor directing requests at <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> but the steps that one might normally
                            expect to be taken by any government were clear. <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d33-03" facs="d33-03"/>Such steps would be liberation of the
                            plane and its crew, immediate return of the $1 million, action against
                            the hijackers which unlike the previous case would signify to them that
                            they were not welcome, would not receive asylum and would be dealt with
                            in conformity with the crime they had committed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> then repeated that he
                            did not feel useful or proper to engage in a discussion of what steps
                            might be taken, Algeria might be able to handle the situation while
                            still able to meet some of its own problems. It might for instance let
                            the hijackers off, then take them into custody and if it did not want to
                            treat with them directly could send them on to a third country. It might
                            allow the plane to land but only to refuel and proceed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not intend to embarrass or
                            pressure <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> but Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> must be aware that Algerians
                            have created a very, very grave situation for us. In the eyes of many US
                            officials the statement issued from Algiers constitutes an encouragement
                            to perpetrate such acts in the future, this endangers civil aviation
                            users and the resulting situation can only be termed intolerable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rein</persName> pointed out that the measures Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> alluded to were not the result
                            of any bilateral obligation of <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> but
                            rather were the sort of measures that Algeria <pb n="4" xml:id="d33-04"
                                facs="d33-04"/>might want to take under its Chicago convention and
                            ICAO memberships. It was not something that was owed to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> responded that
                            normally he would just express his thanks and hurry back to his office
                            to transmit Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>'s comments
                            to his government but he felt constrained to remark on some of the
                            points made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> which
                            had come as a painful surprise to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> had said that <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            encourages hijacking. He did not think that his government encouraged
                            these acts in one way or the other. <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                            >GOA</gloss>'s behavior in previous cases had consistently been to
                            participate in the saving of the lives of the crew and the aircraft
                            involved. <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> does not intend to
                            encourage hijacking throughout the world or interference in US domestic
                            affairs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> must surely
                            know this being an expert and the officer responsible for relations
                            between the US and Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> had quoted a statement that was unknown to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>, he was sure <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was unaware of it also. It was a
                            statement made by an irresponsible person and Algeria could not be made
                            to assume responsibility for it. How could anyone pretend to SPEAK for
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> and pretend to make such appeals
                            in its name. He wished to denounce this statement as a falsehood if it
                            had been made in the name of <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>. He
                            attached absolutely no value to it and rejected the responsibility of
                            its author.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d33-05" facs="d33-05"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> pointed out that he had
                            suggested that <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> bore a measure of
                            responsibility because at the time of the first incident we had stated
                            that unless <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> took legal measures
                            against the hijackers this would only serve to encourage future
                            incidents. Instead the Panthers had publicly announced two weeks ago the
                            granting of asylum and the international Panthers <gloss target="#t_HQ1"
                                >HQ</gloss> located in Algiers in facilities supplied to them by the
                            Algerian Party Organization had thanked <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> for the considerate and comradely attitude shown in
                            this case and had stated that it would seek to carry out other acts of
                            expropriation against the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> recalled that we had
                            raised the question of asylum granted to the Panthers <gloss
                                target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> only once when they had an article in NYT
                            advocating the assassination of the President. Following our demarche
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> had then placed some
                            restrictions upon them. Obviously the Panthers <gloss target="#t_HQ1"
                                >HQ</gloss> is in a country which has control over what goes on in
                            its territory. The two hijackers had been turned over to the Panthers
                            organization and that organization's statement must obviously have had
                            the encouragement or even clearance of <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss>. It is very hard indeed to think the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> does not bear some responsibility. Mr.
                                <persName>Newsom</persName> invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> to consider that if a New York-based group
                            advocating the overthrow of the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was
                            receiving exiles from Algeria, who at gunpoint had <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="d33-06" facs="d33-06"/>extorted $1 million and then
                            proceeded from Algeria to New York then he, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>, would be sitting where Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> was sitting now making
                            very sharp representations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> responded that the
                            relation between our two countries go back many years, have gone through
                            difficult times but the difficulties have always been overcome by calm
                            and equanimity. The recent hijacking case had been solved in this spirit
                            in spite of the complications brought by the world wide campaign of
                            threats of boycott against Algeria, going as far as the Security
                            Council. In this case again, Algeria had not asked for this airplane to
                            be diverted towards its territory; he would check very closely into the
                            situation and hope that it would have a normal outcome. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> would do everything to insure the
                            safety of the crew and aircraft. He wished to assure Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> on this point without even
                            awaiting instructions from his government. As for the rest, he urged Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to trust in the good
                            relations and the climate existing with his country, he was sure that
                            the same procedure based upon good will would obtain in this present
                            case. He stressed the need to allow <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            to act in a calm atmosphere, not in a climate of artificial tempest,
                            under pressure and threat. He expressed his thanks to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and reiterated the esteem of his
                            leaders for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and all
                            the efforts he has made which are highly appreciated. He urged Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> not to allow his work
                            to be placed in jeopardy <pb n="7" xml:id="d33-07" facs="d33-07"/>by a
                            situation which Algeria had not sought and which the US had not wished
                            but of which both were the victims. He stressed that at times it is more
                            difficult to guide one's friends than one's foes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stressed that he
                            understood fully Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>'s
                            position but we in the Department do not determine what the public
                            reaction will be or how airline pilots will react. We did not try to
                            stimulate such a reaction last time; we will not this time. The problem
                            remains with us; it grows more serious each time.</p>
                        <p>Speaking as a friend and not as a part of his official demarche he wanted
                            to stress the importance of mutual confidence in the fabric of the
                            relationship we are trying to build between our two countries. If he
                            were to repeat to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            some of the language used at the time of the previous hijacking and some
                            of the views held now at the highest level of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            would be shocked.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> continued that however
                            hard we may strive to detach events for which neither of us bear any
                            responsibility from the general state of our relations we will not
                            succeed because in the view of many <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            officials there is only one country which so far has not fully
                            cooperated in hijacking problems, at the time when such problems aroused
                            world-wide concern and that country is Algeria and this per force puts
                            Algeria in a very <pb n="8" xml:id="d33-08" facs="d33-08"/>special

                            Algeria and in her respects of international committments. Mr. <persName

                            indeed land in Algeria. It was his personal view that at some point
                            Algeria must make a choice between the responsible image that it wants
                            to have, that we want Algeria to have also and the benefits it derives
                            from sheltering exiles and permitting such exiles to encourage the
                            perpetration of criminal acts seemingly with Algeria's support or
                            acquiescence.</p>

                            <item>SECRETARY SAID U.S. WANTS TO CARRY OUT POLICY OF IMPROVED
                                RELATIONS WITH ARAB COUNTRIES, BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY IS IN OUR
                                INTEREST. THERE IS NO REASON WHY THOSE RELATIONS CANNOT IMPROVE, IN
                                SPITE OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN IN MIDDLE EAST. THE ARABS HAVE
                                NOTHING TO FEAR FROM U.S., U.S. HAS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVES AND DOES NOT
                                WISH TO INTERFERE IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. ONLY ME PROBLEM
                                REMAINS. WE HOPE TO PLAY HELPFUL ROLE BUT ARAB WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK
                                WITH SINGLE VOICE, AND THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MOVE AHEAD. WE
                                HOPE AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN
                                ACTIVE DISCUSSION ON THE PART OF ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED. SUCH
                                DISCUSSIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE FACE TO FACE, BUT AN
                                ACTIVE DIALOGUE AMONG NATIONS IS NEEDED TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE IN
                                MATTER OF ACCOMMODATIONS. DISCUSSIONS CAN LEAD TO INTERIM AGREEMENT,
                                WHICH WILL BE A FIRST STEP TOWARD A FINAL SOLUTION. WE SEE NO
                                ALTERNATIVES; TO HAVE PROGRESS THERE MUST BE A COMMITMENT TO START
                                DISCUSSIONS WITH A VIEW TO COMPLIANCE WITH RESOLUTION 242. WE ALSO
                                RECOGNIZE NEED FOR SOLUTION TO PROBLEM OF THE PALESTINIAN

                                KIDNAPING OF DIPLOMATS, MAY APPEAR JUSTIFIED IN THE MINDS OF THOSE
                                COMMITTING THEM, AS THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE SERVING A GOOD CAUSE, WE
                                FEEL THAT SUCH ACTS SET CAUSE BACK. ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST

                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> in
                            New York on October 12 had been a positive contribution to our bilateral
                            relations, Subjects of interest to both countries had been frankly and
                            fully discussed and the high-level dialogue between senior officials
                            maintained. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said he
                            hopes the U.S. Government now understands why the <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> still believes a written exchange of
                            letters between our two governments on the question of how to handle
                            hijackers <pb n="2" xml:id="d35-02" facs="d35-02"/>would be useful. He
                            emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> wishes to deal
                            with us on this question bilaterally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> replied that the formula proposed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> (forbidding a hijacked
                            aircraft to land in Algeria) is difficult for us to accept because of
                            the risk to the passengers, the crew and aircraft itself. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> referred to the observation
                            made by Mr. <persName>Rein</persName> in their conversation of September
                            14. Even though he understood that Mr. <persName>Rein</persName>'s
                            observation did not represent the official position of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, he wondered if we could not consider
                            it as a point of departure in an attempt to find a formula that would be
                            satisfactory to both countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> agreed that we would continue to examine this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> mentioned that two of
                            the hijackers of the Delta aircraft were escaped convicts. Although we
                            had several times informed the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> of
                            their criminal records, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> appeared unaware of this fact when the
                            subject came up in the discussion with the Secretary in New York. The
                            Foreign Minister had said, however, that we should be able to work
                            together regarding common criminals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> asked that he be provided with a complete
                            legal dossier on these two hijackers which would enable the Algerian
                            judicial authorities to present a formal case against them in an
                            Algerian court. It was agreed that the two governments would remain in
                            touch on this question.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the Middle East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> referred to the discussion between Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> and asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> now has a plan for a Middle East
                            settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> is much more
                            deeply involved in this problem than he and that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> might wish to call on him for
                            a fuller explanation. Speaking personally, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that it was his impression,
                            after having participated in some of the Secretary's bilateral meetings
                            in New York, that the Secretary intends to continue his efforts to find
                            a solution to the Middle East problem, beginning with a partial
                            settlement at the Suez Canal. No one could say at the moment <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d35-03" facs="d35-03"/>exactly what proposal the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might make or what steps we might take,
                            but no one in Washington is satisfied with the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> asked, “Are you
                            thinking of the Palestinians?” and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> replied that we fully realize the need for a
                            settlement that takes into account the rights of the Palestinian people.
                            The problem, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            said, is who speaks for the Palestinians? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> replied that history and justice speak for
                            them. During the Algerian Civil War not all Algerians spoke with one
                            voice, yet there was an obvious solution—to stop the fighting and set up
                            an interim government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that as far as the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            concerned, no “solution” which threatens the existence of Israel is
                            acceptable. Israel's exact frontiers, however, are another question. As
                            for a Palestinian state or provisional government, each Arab country
                            would have its own view and each would try to influence the
                            Palestinians. Egypt, for example, had proposed a provisional Palestinian
                            Government, but now seemed to be backing away from that proposal. If

                            the U.S., which must find a solution which gives the South Vietnamese
                            people an opportunity to determine their own future and at the same time
                            does not give the American people a feeling that they have deserted an

                        <p>Dear <persName>John</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Embassy Airgram A-72 forwards a conversation of significance which I had
                            with the Crown Prince on March 20.</p>
                        <p>It has, as you well know, been our objective to try to move away from the
                            very precise earlier commitments to assist the Crown Prince at the time
                            of his succession. Changes in the Libyan scene have made this kind of
                            help less and less feasible and changes at home have decreased the
                            likelihood that we would render special help of the kind contemplated.
                            At the same time we have wished to avoid creating a feeling in the Crown
                            Prince that we no longer support him for the succession.</p>
                        <p>Through various contacts we have been moving to emphasize that the Crown
                            Prince and his followers must bear the major responsibility for a
                            successful succession.</p>
                        <p>Following on the very helpful guidance on this matter in which you
                            collaborated, I took the opportunity during an audience on March 20 to
                            spell out our position directly to the Prince. The changes which
                            sometimes take place in emphases and meaning when such messages are
                            transmitted indirectly made it in my view desirable that our views be
                            conveyed directly to the Prince. I came away with a feeling that he had
                            read the message and that he now understands and accepts the fact that
                            his accession to the throne depends upon internal rather than external
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>Even though we need no longer consider our precise commitments of an
                            earlier day, I feel that it remains important to us to keep in touch
                            with the Prince through the channel which we have used now for many
                            years. This gives us a further insight into his thinking and provides a
                            link which could assist materially in the preservation of our once major
                            interest in Libya once he accedes to the throne.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d36-02" facs="d36-02"/>
                        <p>The conversation reported in the airgram and reports I have had of
                            contacts with him by other diplomats suggest a very definite improvement
                            in the Prince's awareness of his position and his problems. We also have
                            the feeling that he is now for the first time seeking to widen the
                            circle of his own supporters. The Moroccans and the Tunisians are both
                            making special efforts both in Libya and in connection with his
                            forthcoming visits to the Maghreb states. Morocco and Tunisia now for
                            the first time since my arrival here have first class Ambassadors in
                            Libya, who are making relations with the Crown Prince one of their
                            special objectives. I think we can take some of the credit for this
                            development since we have stressed to both governments on many occasions
                            the importance of their representation in Libya.</p>

                        <p>The import of the coup in Libya will be clearer in another 24-48 hours,
                            Following is to give you the best Washington appraisal as of the end of
                            the day (Monday).</p>
                        <p>A group of young military officers has staged a coup, proclaimed the
                            “Arab Republic of Libya” and set up a Revolutionary Command Council. The
                            head of the council is the only individual publicly named so far as
                            associated with the coup. He is a 34-year-old former officer who has
                            apparently been brought out of “retirement,” Colonel Sa'ad al-Din
                            Abu-Shuawayrib. He received his basic military education in the UAR
                            Cadet College but has since attended US military schools, including
                            Command and General Staff Officer Course in 1964-65. His bio in
                            intelligence files describes him as pro-US, but of course no one should
                            lean too heavily on that description in present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The best we can say about the political complexion of the new government
                            without knowing more about its composition is that its very few initial
                            pronouncements show some moderation. For instance, representatives of
                            the coup group have assured our charge that the coup was directed at the
                            removal of internal corruption—of which there has been an increasing
                            amount recently—and not at any foreign group, east or west. The new
                            government has promised to protect foreign interests, including oil
                            companies. The five-point statement proclaiming the new government said
                            the regime would be socialist, would seek solidarity with the third
                            world and would be based on the Koran. <pb n="2" xml:id="d37-02"
                                facs="d37-02"/>By current Arab standards, this is a mild statement,
                            especially since it omits the vigorous statements on pursuing the
                            struggle for Palestine that one would expect of my more radical
                            group.</p>
                        <p>During the day, we have watched for signs of counter-action by forces
                            seeking to rally behind the monarchy. None so far as we can tell have
                            materialized. The King himself, 80, is in Turkey. The Crown Prince
                            apparently went on the air, renounced his prerogatives as viceroy and
                            urged support of the Revolutionary Command Council. Elements of the
                            police and military which we thought might have resisted have one by one
                            been reported as supporting the coup. The major element not heard from
                            is a large group of civilian politicians who owed their bread and butter
                            to the monarchy. We may learn more of how the politicians have split
                            when the composition of any new cabinet becomes apparent, but in any
                            case resistance now would seem to depend on support from within the army
                            and possibilities for that have narrowed.</p>
                        <p>Since Americans do not seem to be in danger, the main contingencies we
                            have to think about involve Wheelus Base. The Royal Libyan Air Force is
                            based there and depends entirely on US logistical support. If there were
                            any counter-coup, we would have to consider how to react to an Air Force
                            request for support. We might also have to handle requests for asylum at
                            the base. And eventually, the chronic pressures for us to give up the
                            base may reassert themselves. None of these seem to be upon us tonight,
                            so I will not take up your time discussing them. In short, we want to
                            keep Wheelus insulated from this to the maximum extent possible.</p>

                            discussion of possible future problems in the country (Tab C). The paper
                            was prepared for the meeting of the African Inter-Departmental Group on
                            September 2. While it has not been formally cleared with the members
                            present, the paper met with general initial approval and has benefited
                            from subsequent detailed suggestions from participating agencies,
                            including <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JCS1"

                        <p>Events are now moving rapidly in Libya. Former centers of royalist
                            influence in eastern Cyrenaica have fallen to the new regime, and there
                            is little likelihood of any further resistance.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, with regard to the options that appear open to us, I have
                            two recommendations on which we would welcome your decision: <list>

                        <p>1. The identity of the rulers of the new Libyan government remains
                            unclear and no authoritative statements of their objectives and
                            priorities have been made. Nonetheless, they appear in control, and
                            continue to show a posture of moderation and caution. Though avowing
                            “socialism”, no Libyan leader has mouthed the extremist slogans typical
                            of Arab radicals. To the contrary, such themes as the protection of
                            foreign lives and property, the fulfillment of international
                            obligations, and the elimination of corruption and favoritism at home
                            have been stressed. “Social reform” has been emphasized far more than
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d39-03" facs="d39-03"/>socialism in Libyan
                            broadcasts. In private conversations with US officials, members of the
                            ruling Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) have gone even further, and have given the impression
                            of seeking very close relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. Such statements may be deliberate dissimulation, designed to reduce
                            any threat of foreign counterrevolutionary intervention. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably feared US/<gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention; in such circumstances,
                            conciliatory reassurances made good sense. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> did put Idris in power and signed a mutual defense
                            agreement with him. At the time of the coup, there were some 1,100
                            British troops near Tobruq, along with an MF base close by. In addition
                            there was Wheelus, with some 5,000 American personnel, and the Sixth
                            Fleet was not far away.</p>
                        <p>3. Whatever the case, the moderate posture of the Libyan regime is
                            probably temporary, though there are no very good grounds for predicting
                            just when or how this stance will change. We base the judgment that it
                            will on the general tendency of Arab politics over the past two decades:
                            other military-dominated revolutionary regimes have tended, almost
                            without exception, to become more leftist and extreme with the passage
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d39-04" facs="d39-04"/>of time. In Egypt's case
                            this has come about under one leader. In Syria and Iraq, it was the
                            result of successive military coups which brought ever more radical
                            regimes to power.</p>
                        <p>4. Libya could follow either path, or both. It has already declared
                            itself in the Arab revolutionary camp, and will quickly be receiving
                            advice from its new brethren. While the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> members—the ultimate power in Libya—remain shadow
                            figures, we know that at least some civilian officials of their new
                            government will be highly susceptible to this type of influence. So, in
                            all probability, will be the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> itself,
                            not wanting its image tarnished by accusations that it is less than
                            sincere or ardent.</p>

                        <p>5.Beyond this, the coup—as did the July 1958 one in Iraq—has probably
                            created a precedent which will not be forgotten. Most observers inside
                            and outside of Libya had long believed that a military takeover was
                            unlikely in Idris' lifetime. The little army of 8,000 (with only 200-300
                            officers) was greatly outnumbered by the royalist police forces; it
                            lacked that essential instrument of Arab revolution, the tank. The still
                            powerful tribes in Cyrenaica were loyal to the King, who in fact was
                            generally respected by most Libyans. The task of secretly <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d39-05" facs="d39-05"/>planning and carrying out a
                            coordinated takeover of the principal population centers separated by
                            hundreds of miles of desert seemed insuperable.</p>
                        <p>6. But the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, with some armored cars,
                            proved it could be done, and this lesson is not likely to be lost on
                            other Libyans in the future. We do not know how many officers—apparently
                            mostly captains and lieutenants—are in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>, but suspect the group is small enough to maintain
                            secrecy and security and large enough to assure adequate direction and
                            command a coup—perhaps 50 to 60 people. Nor do we know how cohesive this
                            group is, or how susceptible its members might be to possible Algerian
                            or Egyptian influence and intrigue. In the years ahead, the Libyan army
                            will almost certainly be expanded (the old regime had already embarked
                            on a program which would upgrade its equipment and nearly double its
                            size). In the new and more heated political climate of Libya, small
                            clandestine officer groups of Baathist, Arab Nationalists and the like
                            will appear; over time, some may succeed in seizing power.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">Western Military Facilities</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. The US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will likely be in for
                            some sticky times in the years ahead. An overriding theme of the new <pb
                                n="6" xml:id="d39-06" facs="d39-06"/>government, and of any
                            conceivable successor, is an aggressive and militant anti-Israeli
                            posture, and American support of Israel will cause serious problems. For
                            the moment, the new government has said nothing about Wheelus and the
                            British military facilities in Libya, or made any move against them. As
                            it consolidates its hold on power and seeks to get more and more into
                            the mainstream of Arab nationalism, it will probably do so. It might
                            permit them to remain until the respective treaties expire: for example,
                            it could, under the terms of the Base Rights Agreement, formally give
                            notice to the US in December 1970 that it must be out of Wheelus within
                            a year. But pressures, both internal and external, for earlier removal
                            will be strong, and we would give Wheelus only a 50-50 chance of
                            survival until late 1971—and virtually no chance at all of remaining
                            after that. The British, already disliked as the patrons of the old
                            regime, are unlikely to remain all the way to 1973, when their mutual
                            defense pact expires.</p>

                        <p>8. Relations with the oil companies will be a more complicated matter; in
                            this field, such radical tendencies <pb n="7" xml:id="d39-07"
                                facs="d39-07"/>as the new regime may have are likely to be tempered
                            by practical considerations. Idris' government had already initiated
                            negotiations aimed at substantially raising Libya's share of oil
                            revenues. These will of course continue, and Libyan demands may
                            increase. The new regime may follow the course of either of the other
                            two Arab radical oil producers, Iraq or Algeria. The former has left
                            current operations pretty much alone, though it has prevented the
                                US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French owned Iraq Petroleum
                            Company from expanding into new concession areas. The Algerians have
                            been much tougher. Indeed at the time of the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
                            they took the extreme step of putting all American companies (which
                            controlled only about 10 percent of total output) under Algerian
                            management and forbade the repatriation of any earnings, an arrangement
                            still in effect. With the French companies, which produce the bulk of
                            Algeria's petroleum, the government has been less harsh, but it has not
                            hesitated to engage in harassment in the quest for more revenue and more
                            output. The new Libyan government is likely to make similar demands on
                            the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> companies which produce
                            nearly all the Libyan oil. We doubt, however, that they will be treated
                            as rigorously as American producers have been in Algeria, though such
                            treatment cannot be ruled out, especially in the event of another major
                            Arab-Israeli war.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d39-08" facs="d39-08"/>
                        <p>9. There are some rather persuasive reasons why Libyan oil policy appears
                            more likely to resemble that of Algeria. Like the latter, Libya holds
                            some high cards; its oil comes from west of the Suez Canal and is of a
                            very low sulphur content. Hence, shipping costs to Europe are lower, and
                            so are those of refining; the process of removing sulphur to prevent air
                            pollution is a fairly expensive one. Further, the sheer magnitude of
                            Libyan output, now over three million barrels per day and rapidly
                            climbing, will give the regime strength in dealing with the oil
                            companies. Even the implied threat of a sudden cut-off of these supplies
                            which meet about a quarter of Europe's demand would have disruptive
                            effect—even though alternative but more expensive—sources of supply
                            would be available. Thus the Libyan government is in a position to get
                            progressively more demanding with the oil companies. How far and how
                            fast it might go will, of course, depend on how far and how fast the
                            present regime—or a successor—moves in a generally radical direction,
                            though in the last analysis the Libyans will not wish to risk losing
                            their oil revenues, on which they are almost completely dependent.</p>

                        <p>10. The institution of the Khartoum subsidies, the maintenance of a
                            united front against Israel, and the ending of <persName

                            propaganda lulled the conservative or moderate Arab
                            governments—including Libya—into a false sense of security. We believe
                            that the governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (and Morocco and
                            Tunisia) may—to varying degrees—be more susceptible to overthrow than
                            they were before the Libyan coup. There is evidence of substantial
                            popular discontent in each country. Their regimes—like that of Idris—are
                            viewed by many of their citizens as too friendly to the US, soft on
                            Israel, corrupt, and unconcerned with the welfare of the ordinary
                            citizen. The lesson that a handful of obscure junior army officers can
                            successfully pull off a coup against a conservative regime in very
                            difficult circumstances will not be lost in these countries.</p>
                        <p>11. If in the next year or two, one or more of these moderate regimes
                            were overthrown, this would not mean that some new and more effective
                            stage of Arab political unity, under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> or anybody else, would be in the offing. For the
                            most part, Arab unity has been a myth, but there has been a fairly <pb
                                n="10" xml:id="d39-10" facs="d39-10"/>consistent unity amongst
                            revolutionary Arab states on the subject of Israel. It should be
                            remembered that, in the aftermath of the June war, the Arab
                            radicals—Iraq and Algeria included —strongly urged using Arab oil as a
                            means of pressuring the US to change its pro-Israeli policies. The
                            refusal of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Libya to join in killed that
                            project. Libya might not be so reluctant again. Were new revolutionary
                            governments to appear in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, this could mean very
                            difficult times for American oil companies throughout the Arab world. In
                            any event, the Libyan coup represents one more step in a process of
                            polarization in the Middle East, which could see the Arabs all aligned
                            on one side, confronting the US as well as Israel on the other.</p>

                                runs risk either of generating requests for additional commitments

                                stability and security of regime depends overwhelmingly on its own
                                actions. US strongly believes viability greatest where regimes
                                maintain enlightened, vigilant attention to basic national social
                                and economic needs. US has endeavored, while not ignoring direct
                                security requirements, to emphasize these other needs in relations

                                themselves vulnerable to sudden change, there is little US can do to

                                itself is serious and unpopular matter in modern context and may

                                suggested that even when foreign government might be sympathetic to
                                intervention, internal political factors within its own borders
                                might seriously limit support it is able to give in this

                            <item>One further factor needs emphasizing. In dynamics of modern

                                    withdrawal of US military facilities from Libya.</item>
                                <item>- The US trusts training can resume in the interim.</item>
                                <item>- If asked, <persName>Palmer</persName> is authorized to say
                                    that the talks could cover the possibility of our evacuating the
                                    base before termination of the agreement (December 1972).</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>They decided that they did not need to clear this position with the
                            President. Having lost my argument with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> that it made sense to check this with the
                            President in view of his interest in our general posture, I asked that
                            they send over an information memo explaining their position.</p>
                        <p>In substance, I do not see much problem in the position that they have
                            taken, In fact, <persName>Palmer</persName> will go in with this line,
                            receive a curt response and be back with a recommendation to drop the
                            effort to resume training and perhaps to begin talks before December 15.
                            The substantive issue is whether we have a fight with the Libyans over
                            this or whether we bow to the inevitable gracefully.</p>
                        <p>You are the judge of whether the bureaucratic principle involved here is
                            a matter of concern. The Secretaries have in effect assumed that we are
                            out of the base and that the only questions to be decided now are the
                            tactics of negotiating an orderly withdrawal. They have decided that
                            they do not need to bother the President with these operational
                            questions. I do not quarrel with the judgment about the base; the only
                            question is whether you feel the President is sufficiently reconciled to
                            the situation that he will not be taken aback by the Secretaries
                            decision.</p>

                                million in annual profits to US corporations and 25% of Western

                                sources until 1971. It concludes that Western Europe is too
                                dependent on Libyan crude to refuse to buy. Only 8% of Libyan

                                <hi rend="underline">Economic pressures</hi> range through
                                requesting US companies to curtail their offtake, advising US
                                technicians to leave, cutting off US oil imports from Libya,

                                    <item>The <hi rend="underline">argument for</hi> is that oil
                                        income is the Libyan government's main source of income. Any
                                        move that effectively cut into this would cause Libyan
                                        concern, although Libya now has more income than it can use
                                        so it has some cushion.</item>

                                    <item>The <hi rend="underline">argument against</hi> is
                                        essentially that US companies would suffer more than the
                                        Libyan government. European companies are ready to replace
                                        American in marketing Libyan oil. The Libyan government
                                        could cause some disruption in foreign exchange markets by
                                        shifting its reserves suddenly.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>A small group of young Army officers (the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) has overthrown the Libyan monarchy. The political
                            inclinations of this group are still unclear, and possibly varied. While
                            the group has installed a civilian cabinet which includes two key
                            members who violently disagree with our Middle East policy, it is still
                            too early to state that either the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            or the civilian government is fundamentally anti-U.S. For the moment it
                            appears that latent Libyan xenophobia, which has spilled over into
                            Libyan-U.S. relations in recent weeks, also characterizes the new
                            regime's attitudes toward all foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Libyan policy emphasizes Libyan nationalism in internal matters while
                            identifying itself closely with radical Arab positions internationally.
                            The new government has threatened an important U.S. interest by renewing
                            the demands, posed twice under the monarchy but reversed by the King,
                            for the removal of the U.S. and British bases and facilities.</p>
                        <p>While there is no discernible opposition, the regime shows signs of
                            insecurity and inexperience. It is particularly concerned about the
                            eastern region, Cyrenaica, the power base of the Senussi monarchy, and
                            rural areas of Tripolitania. Unless the Army should split, the national
                            police, now effectively neutralized by the Army, represents the only
                            possible counterforce. The former King has voluntarily moved to Egypt
                            this month; the Crown Prince is in jail. Other possible contenders to
                            the throne remain free but under surveillance in Benghazi.</p>
                        <p>The other major U.S. interest, the $5 billion (replacement value) in oil
                            investment, remains untouched for the moment. The regime has pledged
                            respect for the oil agreements and has so far demonstrated this except
                            in one case in which a company was closely tied to associates of the
                            former King. We see no immediate threat to these interests, although
                            such could result if the regime is threatened, or becomes increasingly
                            unstable, or if there were a real confrontation over Wheelus, or in the
                            event of renewed hostilities in the Middle East. While only 8 percent of
                            Libya's 3 million bbls/day production comes to the U.S., 90 percent <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d44-05" facs="d44-05"/>is produced by twenty-eight
                            American companies. Their activity netted the U.S. balance of payments
                            $680 million in 1968. Sales are principally to West Germany, the U.K.,
                            Italy and Spain; Europe is now dependent on Libya for 25 percent (3
                            million bbls/day of short-haul oil) of its oil requirements; if Libyan
                            oil were cut off, the shortfall could not be made up within less than
                            one year because of production and transportation problems.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">B. Present U.S. Strategy:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our present strategy is to seek to establish satisfactory relations with
                            the new regime. The return to our balance of payments and the security
                            of U.S. investments in oil are considered our primary interests. We seek
                            to retain our military facilities, but not at the expense of threatening
                            our economic return. We also wish to protect European dependence on
                            Libyan oil; it is literally the only “irreplaceable” oil in the world,
                            from the point of view both of quality and geographic location.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans have asked that we withdraw from Wheelus before December 24,
                            1971, the earliest date on which the present agreement could be allowed
                            to expire. We plan an early response to the Libyan request in which we
                            will agree to the principle of early withdrawal and propose detailed
                            discussions. While there is no doubt that the removal of the base is, as
                            it always has been, a popular local issue, at least some military
                            officers in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> may be more
                            interested in retaining our help in the creation of a Libyan air force
                            and in an orderly transition. Their freedom of action may be limited by
                            the intense popular feeling against our stand on the Arab-Israel issue.
                            A change in the status of the base seems inevitable; our ability to
                            secure an extension of the essential training facilities at Wheelus is
                            now unclear. We have as yet, however, found no fully satisfactory
                            alternative site(s) for this training. The British, too, are prepared to
                            accept a change in the status of their facilities. They hope to remain
                            the prime military supplier to the Libyans and to retain some training
                            rights, however. The British have the advantage of less identification
                            with Israel.</p>
                        <p>In developing our short-term strategy vis-à-vis the new Libyan
                            government, we have a choice between a policy which is essentially that
                            of confrontation and a policy which would involve some give on our part
                            with a view to developing longer-term relationships with the new and
                            still insecure regime. In general, we opt for the latter.</p>

                        <p>In response to the request of the WSAG the following possible alternative
                            pressures on or against the regime are set forth. They are not mutually
                            exclusive; they could be applied single or in combination. Because of
                            the generally increased risk each would pose to our economic interests
                            in Libya, because almost any one of them would place our broader
                            interests in jeopardy throughout the Arab world, and because some of
                            them would threaten Europe's dependence on Libyan oil, none of the
                            alternatives is recommended at this time. Annexes exploring in greater

                                                would make voluntary compliance difficult. Since
                                                many are small and without alternative sources to
                                                meet their European contract commitments, and since
                                                the major producers are non-vertically integrated,
                                                they have less flexibility than elsewhere in the

                                                greater threat of nationalization. Libya would
                                                probably retaliate by cancelling concessions.

                                                been concerned about the spectacular growth in
                                                offtake; it might prefer to slow the depletion of a

                                                obtain Eastern Bloc and other nationals to operate

                                            the Libyan coast.</p>
                                        <p>PRO: This might demonstrate to the Libyans our
                                            displeasure at recent events. It would serve to
                                            underscore the importance we attach to our interests in
                                            Libya.</p>
                                        <p>CON: A show of force, to be effective, would have to be
                                            followed by other actions; use of the Sixth Fleet in
                                            this way at the present time would have serious
                                            political consequences elsewhere in the Middle East; in
                                            retaliation the Libyans might invite the Soviet
                                            Mediterranean Fleet to call at Libyan ports.</p>

                                                protect lives and property. We would at the same
                                                time make pledge of noninterference so long as U.S.

                                        <p>PRO: We could do this under present agreements which
                                            permit us freedom of movement of troops into our agreed
                                            areas. Placing of troops would enable us to move them
                                            out to protect lives and installations elsewhere in the
                                            country. It would make the regime uncertain regarding
                                            our subsequent intentions and secure us full use of our
                                            facilities. Given sufficient force and airlift it could
                                            provide the means for preventing mob action against our
                                            people and installations, particularly away from urban
                                            areas. It would give heart to our friends such as
                                            Tunisia and Morocco.</p>

                                        <p>CON: British agreement to such a scheme would be
                                            doubtful. We would have difficulty in getting overflight
                                            rights from Europe (and possibly even from Tunisia and
                                            Morocco) for a massive troop lift. It would undoubtedly
                                            mean long-term occupation by combat forces of these
                                            facilities. We would risk serious criticism from most of
                                            the rest of the world and be giving away a substantial
                                            propaganda weapon. Even with forces in our facilities we
                                            could not guarantee the safety of all our citizens and
                                            investments. We would be undertaking drastic action for
                                            short-term gain, but incurring serious longer-term
                                            costs. Finally, and under the best of circumstances, we
                                            could not legally maintain troops at the facilities
                                            beyond 1971.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="underline">

                            </hi> opened the discussion by explaining the origin of the Libya paper.
                            The President had expressed concern over the direction Libya might be
                            taking and wanted to consider what the U.S. could do to reverse the
                            trend or to indicate to the Revolutionary Government that we are not
                            going to be entirely quiescent. The President had become interested as a
                            result of his talks with moderate Arab leaders and with the Shah, who
                            had suggested transferring the Libyan oil quota to Iran.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2"
                                    >Johnson</persName>
                            </hi> noted that the U.S. imports so little Libyan oil that loss of the
                            U.S. market would be of small concern to Libya. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that existing regulations
                            made it very difficult to reallocate oil quotas.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            </hi> explained the assumptions underlying the Libya paper. The major
                            U.S. interest in Libya was considered to be oil, both because of its
                            effect on our balance of payments and because of European dependence on
                            Libyan oil supplies. The key issue was how to protect our oil interests
                            in the context of Libyan demands for withdrawal from Wheelus Air Base
                            and our desire to reverse the trend toward radicalism in Libya if at all
                            possible. The general conclusion was that U.S. options were extremely
                            limited.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            </hi> said the immediate problem is the Libyan demand that we leave
                            Wheelus. We are to begin talks with the Libyans on December 15. While we
                            do not completely rule out a possible change in the Libyan political
                            climate, we do not believe that the U.S. can take action to foster a
                            political change without running a serious risk of strengthening the
                            weak revolutionary regime. Under these circumstances our objective is to
                            maintain satisfactory relations with the Revolutionary Government but to
                            hold open our other options.</p>

                            </hi> summarized the basic approach of the paper as assuming that Libya
                            is not yet irreconcilably hostile to the U.S. but that many actions
                            which the U.S. might take would turn the Revolutionary Government
                            against us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"

                            </hi> asked what would happen if the Revolutionary Government does
                            become irreconcilably hostile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> replied that the Libyans might nationalize U.S.
                            oil properties. However, even were that to happen, the U.S. would have
                            little leverage. A Hickenlooper situation would not arise. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d45-04" facs="d45-04"/>asked if any of the measures
                            analyzed in the Libya paper might be utilized in the event oil
                            nationalization takes place. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> suggested that three such actions might be taken:
                            (1) Withdrawal of U.S. oil technicians, (2) transfer of the oil quota,
                            and (3) freezing of Libyan assets in the U.S. In addition, one other
                            possibility not mentioned in the paper would be to curtail facilities
                            for transporting Libyan oil to European markets. However, there were few
                            U.S. owned or registered vessels in this trade. Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> suggested that U.S.
                            companies might, however, cooperate with a boycott of Libyan oil
                            although if a boycott were undertaken we would be faced with the problem
                            of finding alternative oil supplies for Europe.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> noted the
                            importance of examining the consequences of loss of Libyan oil to
                            Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that the
                            German situation was critical because 45 percent of Libyan oil went to
                            West Germany. One oil expert had described Libya as the only
                            irreplaceable source of petroleum. This was because of the difficulty of
                            arranging alternate sources of supply. In addition, European refineries
                            were geared to Libyan oil and would require adjustments in order to
                            utilize petroleum from other sources.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            </hi> suggested the possibility of consulting the West Germans to
                            determine if they have considered alternative supplies. In response to a
                            question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>,
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> said the
                            matter could probably be raised with the Germans without danger of a
                            leak but he wondered if it were necessary to talk to the Germans at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>
                            </hi> said that he considered the paper a fair statement of the options
                            available in the present and perhaps the immediately foreseeable
                            circumstances. However, it might be worth considering what the U.S.
                            should do if the Revolutionary regime turns hostile. It would be useful
                            to have a definition of “hostile” and to be able to present to the
                            President the steps which we might take under such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            </hi> pointed out that in the event the Libyans turned hostile, another
                            possible danger, in addition to oil nationalization, would be a campaign
                            of violence against the American community in Libya. Many of the
                            Americans are located in the oil field areas. The popular mood in Libya,
                            under the influence of Nasserist propaganda, is growing less friendly.
                            If the American community were threatened, the U.S. might have to
                            undertake a military supported evacuation.</p>

                            </hi> asked if there was a plan for such an evacuation, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that we have a
                            plan which was tested once, in 1967, when we evacuated American
                            dependents.</p>
                        <p>

                            </hi> said that the analysis of possible military actions should be
                            amplified to include the possibility of military evacuation. He asked
                            about the strategy to be followed in the event of evacuation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that it was
                            planned to have U.S. forces enter through Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"

                            </hi> then raised the question of the military actions discussed in the
                            present Libya paper. He asked if anyone believed that the U.S. could
                            take any of these actions. He questioned the credibility of a show of
                            force, noting that this technique was effective when used by the British
                            in the 19th Century because it was known that further action would be
                            taken in the event the show of force did not get results.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            </hi> thought there was little likelihood of being able to take military
                            action in Libya. Insofar as British cooperation was concerned, it was
                            clear that the British had little interest in getting involved. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then instructed
                            that Military Option A (Show of Force) be dropped from the plan.</p>

                            this was not feasible, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1"
                                >Nutter</persName> agreed.</p>

                            </hi> asked if we should consider sending ground forces to Libya in the
                            event the Libyan regime turned hostile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1"
                                >Karamessines</persName> and Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            replied that this depended upon the purpose. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explained that in the case of
                            evacuation there was general agreement that in extreme circumstances we
                            would have to employ military force. However, in situations other than
                            evacuation, the use of military forces appeared dubious. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> noted that employment of forces
                            in Libya could not be separated from the general problem of utilizing
                            U.S. troops in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Referring to a recent intelligence report concerning a Libyan approach to
                            the French for 300 planes, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1"
                                >Karamessines</persName> asked about the possibility of talking to

                            an impending or actual nationalization. [text not declassified] Admiral
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the Libyans had also
                            approached West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> asked what
                            our response might be if the Libyans came to us for military assistance.
                            Would we be willing to pay something in the way of military aid in order
                            to maintain a position at Wheelus? We might well be faced with this
                            question when talks about the base begin on December 15.</p>

                            </hi> commented that there were some hints that the Libyans may wish to
                            retain a relationship with the U.S. based upon supply of military
                            equipment and training but that they would not want to continue the base
                            relationship. The question was whether it was worth maintaining the kind
                            of presence that would be possible by providing military assistance and
                            training. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked
                            about our present assistance programs and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that the U.S. provided
                            training and second echelon maintenance to the Libyan Air Force. In
                            addition, the Lockheed Company has a contract for assisting the Libyan
                            Air Force. The U.S. is selling Libya some F-5's, which are to be
                            delivered in 1970.</p>

                            </hi> suggested that as long as the Libyan question was coming before
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> it might be well to wrap up the
                            Wheelus question at that time. The principal issue was whether we wanted
                            to go to the bitter end in seeking to retain the present base agreement.
                            We would need to determine how much we would be willing to pay to retain
                            the base or some sort of military presence in Libya.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that in
                            accordance with the agreement each party could, beginning on December
                            24, 1970, terminate the agreement with one year's notice. The Libyan
                            mood is clear. They will not permit resumption of training activities at
                            the base and want the U.S. to withdraw. It appears that the best we can
                            get is one more year for the U.S. presence at Wheelus but with training
                            activities suspended. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2"
                                >Johnson</persName> added that under these circumstances we would be
                            getting about one year less than provided in the agreement.</p>

                            He also asked if the Libyans had the right to suspend training at the
                            base. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that there
                            was no right to suspend training but that we have acquiesced in the
                            Libyan request, since the consequences of opposing it seemed even more
                            undesirable.</p>

                            the Libyans in order not to risk losing U.S. oil properties. He asked
                            what would happen when we had yielded to the Libyans on the base and
                            other military matters and they then proceeded to nationalize the oil
                            properties. He suggested that we might perhaps adopt a somewhat tougher
                            negotiating stance although he did not want to suggest that we hold to
                            the base agreement to the bitter end. It would seem, however, that if we
                            were too nice to the Libyans, we might only entrench the revolutionary
                            regime more firmly.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that unarmed aircraft are

                            </hi> said that we had assumed for a long time that when the King left
                            the scene, pressures on us to withdraw from Wheelus would arise. In
                            fact, moves for U.S. withdrawal had come up twice in the past, and we
                            had managed to retain the base only by burying the issue after months of
                            negotiations. It seemed hard to conceive that a future Libyan Government
                            would permit resumption of training or would allow the agreement to run
                            its course. Another problem was the fact that the U.S. aircraft
                            stationed at Wheelus were Phantoms, which are embarrassing to the
                            Government of Libya because this type of aircraft is associated with
                            U.S. assistance to Israel.</p>

                            at Wheelus. Our present strategy, looking to the talks scheduled to
                            begin December 15, is to lay the alternatives before the Libyans, state
                            our willingness to withdraw and point out the complexities that would
                            arise with regard to maintaining the Libyan Air Force after a U.S.

                            to the Army the possible problems that might arise if the U.S. withdrew
                            from Wheelus. He cautioned, however, against overreliance on our

                            probably wish to know about some of these actions and that he was averse
                            to giving the President a paper in which every possible action was

                            we would lose Wheelus sooner or later. Thus, the main question was to
                            determine under what conditions and with what kind of a posture the U.S.
                            would withdraw. If the U.S. were too tough, a bad situation might
                            develop in Libya. On the other hand, if we were too compliant, the
                            consequences might also be bad. He wondered if appeasement would be
                            effective in saving the oil properties and observed that the Libyans
                            needed to have some motive for wanting to have a U.S. presence in their

                            the U.S. is not liked in Libya. Our real choice is between attempting to

                            with all deliberate speed to negotiate our differences in such a manner

                        <p>I gather you told <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>
                            that you wanted to clear the negotiating instructions on Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>As you know, State and Defense tried for a week to get us to break the
                            negotiating deadlock between them. We stood aside, and they have now
                            come to terms with each other.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> has sent the resulting cable
                            under the attached note (Tab A). I have described it in a possible
                            information memo to the President. He has asked for clearance by Friday,
                            December 12.</p>
                        <p>I have written the attached memo to the President for his information. It
                            does not seem to me that negotiating tactics on something like this are
                            a subject he should be bothered with.</p>
                        <p>On the tactics themselves, I believe we should now let State and Defense
                            continue to haggle this out and just go along with their compromise.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Tripoli reports that agreement has been reached with the
                            Libyans on a US withdrawal date from Wheelus (June 30, 1970) and on the
                            arrangements designed to assure that the American withdrawal is
                            dignified. Although the Libyans have proved to be hard bargainers, the
                            atmosphere of the talks has remained cordial. An agreed minute is
                            expected to be signed at 8:00 p.m., Tripoli time (1:00 p.m., our time)
                            December 23.</p>
                        <p>Signing of the minute may coincide with the arrival of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Tripoli as a guest of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit, which is expected to last
                            for two days, may also result in an announcement of closer
                            Libyan-Egyptian political or military cooperation, perhaps extending to
                            Sudan. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s presence may also
                            surface the fact that Egyptian troops, approximately 1,000, have been in
                            Libya for about a week.</p>
                        <p>This combination of events may provoke domestic criticism of the
                            Department for having agreed to negotiate for a US withdrawal from
                            Wheelus at this particular time. If such criticism arises, the following
                            replies may reasonably be made: <list>

                                <item>The continued US presence at Wheelus, long after the
                                    conclusion of World War II, has been an increasing source of
                                    irritation in US-Libyan relations for several years. The new
                                    regime's request for a US withdrawal undoubtedly reflects
                                    significant Libyan popular feeling.</item>

                                <item>The British decision to withdraw by March 31, 1970, obviously
                                    made more difficult any US “hold-out” on Wheelus.</item>

                        <p>1. The United Kingdom of Libya lasted almost 18 years. In this period, it
                            passed from being one of the poorest nations in the world, heavily
                            dependent on subsidies from the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>, to the role of a major, wealthy oil producer. The policies
                            of the monarchy were established almost entirely by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>. Recognizing the value of British
                            support since the days when the British freed Libya from Italian
                            domination and the importance of the US aid that kept the Kingdom
                            solvent in its early years, <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>
                            was willing and able to stand fast against the growing tide of Libyan
                            enthusiasm for the Arab cause against Israel and to risk the opprobrium
                            associated with foreign military installations on Libyan soil. In
                            September 1969, however, the royal regime was suddenly overthrown by a
                            group of young army officers directed by a Revolutionary Command Council
                                (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">II. THE NATURE AND STABILITY OF THE NEW REGIME</p>
                        <p>2. The real power in the new regime resides in the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> has not given any meaningful responsibility to the
                            civilian ministers it has appointed, and there is very little trust or
                            sympathy between the military and civilian components of the government.
                            The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members lack both the expertise
                            and the machinery for making and implementing decisions in an orderly
                            way—a circumstance which is likely to become more obvious and
                            troublesome with time. Available information indicates that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is a collegial group of about <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d50-04" facs="d50-04"/>a dozen members, virtually all
                            between the ages of 25 and 30. Most of them attended the Libyan Royal
                            Military Academy together, graduating in 1965 and 1966, and most have
                            attended military courses in the US and/or the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. Information on the internal functioning of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and of relative standing within the
                            group is extremely scanty. Its president, Colonel Muammar Qadhaafi,
                            apparently is at present the most powerful individual although not the
                            sole source of authority. The leaders appear to have the active support
                            of a larger group of adherents, numbering 50 to 100 officers (10-20
                            percent of the total officer strength of the Libyan Armed Forces).</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has not so far been challenged
                            from outside its own ranks. There is considerable grousing and
                            criticism, and those who have lost power and status as a result of the
                            coup undoubtedly are unhappy. However, most of the prominent
                            personalities of the old regime are in exile or under detention. Most of
                            those who have thus far escaped the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>s
                            ire are likely to remain quiescent. There have been some reports of
                            efforts by old regime figures to promote resistance activities among the
                            broadly pro-royalist Cyrenaican tribes, but it appears unlikely that
                            these elements will pose a serious challenge to the new regime in the
                            near future. Since the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> disarmed or
                            otherwise neutralized all security forces outside the regular army, the
                            potential for active opposition from these quarters also appears low for
                            some time to come.</p>
                        <p>4. While individual members may hold particular philosophies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> does not yet appear to have a clear and
                            agreed program beyond the negative one of expunging what its members
                            consider offensive features of the previous regime. Domestically, they
                            seem bent on eradicating corruption and social inequities. In external
                            matters, they are determined to eliminate the Western military presence
                            symbolized primarily by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases at
                            Tobruk and El Adem and the US base at Wheelus. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s actions so far have underlined both
                            the Libyan and the Arab character of the revolution. The regime speeded
                            up the Libyanization of foreign-owned banks which had begun under the
                            monarchy. It introduced partial prohibition, presumably out of deference
                            to Islamic fundamentalism. It removed foreign-language signs and deleted
                            English language courses from the school curriculum. It carried out
                            widespread arrests of politicians, businessmen, and senior military
                            personnel associated with the old regime, and preparations for a series
                            of show trials are underway.</p>
                        <p>5. At the start, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> was clearly
                            fearful of military intervention by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and the US in behalf of <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName>. As soon as it felt that this immediate threat had
                            passed, the regime announced that it wanted foreign military
                            installations removed from Libyan soil as quickly as possible.
                            Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> remains
                            apprehensive of direct Western intervention, and it is clearly worried
                            about potential domestic challenge. These concerns, combined with a
                            desire to solidify Libyan ties with the Arab community, lie behind some
                            recent Libyan moves on the Arab stage. Shortly after the revolution, the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> brought in about 150 Egyptian
                            civilian advisors and an equal number of military ones; they are <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d50-05" facs="d50-05"/>particularly noticeable in the
                            security and information fields. In mid-December, two battalions of
                            Egyptian troops were brought to Libya.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has also endorsed proposals
                            for closer association among Sudan, Egypt, and Libya and has sometimes
                            referred to itself as the Committee of Free Unionist Officers. There is
                            a considerable bond between Libya and Egypt, based on longstanding
                            social, cultural, and educational links. Moreover, any group of
                            revolutionary young Arab officers cannot help but look upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a successful model.
                            Nevertheless, we are inclined to believe that the emphasis in any
                            association will be on military and economic cooperation well short of
                            complete union. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, for his
                            part, would find even a very loose association a useful means of
                            exerting influence over the inexperienced <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>7. There are many in Libya, however, who neither like nor trust
                            Egyptians. Many Libyans fear that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> intends steps which would put Libya's 1.8 million
                            people and huge oil revenues under Cairo's control. Indeed, the first
                            split in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> occurred ostensibly
                            because Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HHAS1">HAWAAZ</persName>
                            opposed QADHAAFI's moves toward Egypt, and the subsequent arrival of
                            Egyptian troops in Libya offer grounds for future opposition to the
                            QADHAAFI regime. We cannot say, given present skimpy evidence, whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and its supporters will be able
                            to overcome future divisiveness within their own ranks. Such matters as
                            relations with Egypt, personal ambition, and opportunities for
                            corruption offer ample grounds for future splits.</p>
                        <p>8. If the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> hangs together, it is
                            likely to be able to maintain power for some time. Any challenge from
                            outside will be slow to develop, and the military holds the power in the
                            country. Under <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> rule, a general
                            breakdown of internal stability that would threaten foreign citizens and
                            foreign-owned property is not likely, although occasional localized
                            disruptions are possible. If a part of the present <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> were to seize control or if another
                            group of officers should move in, the odds are that a successor
                            government would pursue domestic and Arab policies not greatly
                            dissimilar to those of the present regime.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">III. MAJOR POLICY ISSUES</p>
                        <p>8. Many of the important issues facing the inexperienced young <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members involve Western interests; in
                            view of the strong urge the regime has for national independence and
                            sovereignty, this foreign involvement will be a major factor in decision
                            making. The most obvious manifestations of foreign influence, of course,
                            are the military installations; on this issue, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has already been able to reach a firm,
                            and we believe irrevocable, decision. Oil concession agreements, foreign
                            involvement in corruption charges against old regime figures, arms
                            procurement, Libya's role in the Arab-Israeli quarrel, and economic
                            management are far more complex questions. For the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members, the proper handling of these
                            issues is vital to their own ability to maintain order and continue
                            themselves in power. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> approach

                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> will be closely monitoring
                            the adherence of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to agreed
                            schedules for the removal of forces from Libya. This will be extremely
                            important to the future of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            itself as well as to the course of Libyan relations with both countries.
                            US control over Wheelus Air Base, the British garrison at Tobruk, and
                            British control over El Adem Air Base are anathema to the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> for a number of reasons. The 6,000 US
                            and British military personnel in the country at the time of the
                            revolution were seen by the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as a
                            potential threat to Libya, whose armed forces numbered only about 8,000.
                            The bases are a highly visible reminder of Libyan dependence on foreign
                            tutelage and a negation of Libyan and Arab nationalism. Moreover,
                            evacuation is a clear and simple goal, while the task of governing the
                            country is proving to be complicated and difficult.</p>
                        <p>11. Domestic criticism at the absence of bold new initiatives toward the
                            reforms the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has promised has already
                            appeared. In such circumstances, evacuation of the bases and distraction
                            of the public by corruption trials are very important to the regime,
                            which will need some political triumphs in the months ahead. Evacuation
                            of the bases in a manner satisfactory to the Libyans will not guarantee
                            good relations with the US, but any other outcome would seriously
                            prejudice US interests.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">B. Oil Policy</p>
                        <p>12. Upon its accession to power, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            announced that it would honor all existing international
                            commitments-specifically including oil concessions. It also pledged to
                            punish all those guilty of flagrant corruption under the monarchy. The
                            two promises are not wholly compatible, since many existing oil
                            concessions—as well as other commercial agreements—were obtained by
                            influence-peddling and bribery involving both highly placed Libyans and
                            foreign individuals and corporations. The corruption trials are slated
                            to begin soon, and any oil companies publicly named in the trials could
                            be an early target for punitive actions.</p>
                        <p>13. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is unlikely to
                            take such action against the nine current oil producers.(See Table.) Oil
                            production is a source of huge revenues ($952 million in 1968 and an
                            estimated $1.3 billion in 1969) which the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> wishes to retain. Moreover, the major corruption
                            charges revolve around concession awards made in 1966 and 1969 to a
                            number of companies, most of which are not yet producing. Most currently
                            producing companies had obtained concessions earlier and could be
                            omitted from the proceedings.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> for higher payments to the
                            Libyan Government. Libya received just over $1 per barrel in 1967 and
                            1968—a higher payment than any major producing country except Venezuela
                            and about 15c per barrel more than Persian Gulf producers. But Libyan
                            oil has an unusually favorable combination of characteristics. It can be
                            delivered to Europe by tanker in only six days, whereas most Persian
                            Gulf oil is 35 to 40 days away from Europe so long as the Suez Canal
                            remains closed. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for high priced
                            products such as gasoline and naphtha, and it has almost no
                            sulphur—making it exceptionally low in air pollutants. Libya can play
                            off some producing companies against others. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> will probably push vigorously the Idris regime's demand
                            for an upward revision of the price structure on which Libyan revenues
                            are correlated. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is also likely
                            to be much more adamant than the monarchy about pressing for increased
                            government control of oil field operations and for participation by the
                            government-owned Libyan Petroleum Company.</p>
                        <p>15. A Libyan attempt to nationalize oil production does not appear
                            likely, particularly in the coming months when the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is trying to learn its job and
                            consolidate its control. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out,
                            especially in the event of major Arab-Israeli military hostilities. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is deeply committed to the Arab
                            cause, and oil is the major weapon at Libyan disposal. Moreover, Libya
                            is in a unique position to carry out nationalization without severe
                            damage to itself. The principal bar to nationalization has historically
                            been domination of the oil trade and markets by the seven major
                            international oil companies; their share of the world market, however,
                            has dropped from abut 90 percent in 1959 to some 75 percent in 1968, and
                            they <pb n="8" xml:id="d50-08" facs="d50-08"/>produce only about half of
                            Libya's total output. West European countries depend greatly on Libyan
                            oil. Twenty-five percent of the crude oil imported in 1968 by the
                            European Common Market countries—and 43 percent of West German
                            imports—came from Libya. If suppliers could not meet their contractual
                            deliveries, independent oil companies in importing countries would
                            probably not refuse to buy oil from nationalized companies, as long as
                            the price remained competitive. Furthermore, Libya has accumulated
                            foreign exchange reserves adequate to ride out a lengthy period during
                            which it could seek new customers; imports other than oil field
                            equipment could be maintained at current levels for roughly two years
                            with the funds Libya now has on hand.</p>
                        <p>16. For the US, the impact of Libyan oil policy will be reflected
                            principally in the balance of payments. By the end of 1968, American oil
                            companies had invested about $1.2 billion in Libya and had repatriated
                            profits totaling over $1.5 billion, The profit inflow was $478 million
                            in 1968 and probably will amount to about $600 million in 1969. In
                            addition, oil company purchases of equipment accounted for over $140
                            million out of a net inflow to the US of some $205 million from trade
                            and other transactions with Libya in 1968. The effect of Libyan pressure
                            for an increasing share in total oil earnings will be to somewhat retard
                            the rapid growth of the profit flow, which has doubled in the past two
                            years. Should American oil interests in Libya be nationalized,
                            compensation even at the full total of cumulative investment would be
                            equivalent to only two years' profit remittances at the current rate.
                            Compensation at the declared book value of $700 million would be
                            equivalent to profit remittances for only about one year. In case of
                            nationalization, the balance of payments impact on the US would be
                            somewhat offset by increased production and profits from
                            American-operated concessions in other producing countries.</p>

                        <p>17. The Libyan regime is seeking arms. It almost certainly will want
                            tanks and aircraft, probably in quantities at least as great as those
                            the Idris regime was considering. The new regime has not withdrawn
                            requests made by the monarchy for Chieftain tanks from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and jet fighters from the US, and it
                            probably will continue to look to Washington and London for major items.
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has already shown its
                            interest in diversifying sources of military support by contacting
                            France and other Western countries about the prospects for both arms and
                            training assistance. In some of these contacts, Libya may be acting as
                            an intermediary for other Arab states. With cash available to purchase
                            whatever it wants, Libya is in an excellent position. If it cannot
                            satisfy its desires in the West, we do not think it would be
                            particularly reluctant to turn to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>18. The Libyans have stated that they mean to use Wheelus as a military
                            airfield, but they will certainly not require the full extent of its
                            facilities. To <pb n="9" xml:id="d50-09" facs="d50-09"/>operate what
                            they do need, they may choose to hire civilian contractors. In line with
                            their desire to escape from predominant US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> tutelage, they might turn to German or French sources
                            for assistance. It is more likely, however, that they will request help
                            from Egypt, which is capable of providing military or civilian
                            technicians to run Wheelus at the level the Libyans will require.</p>
                        <p>19. If the Egyptians desire, the Libyans also would probably agree to
                            Egyptian use of either Wheelus or El Adem as dispersal fields for
                            Egyptian aircraft. From the Egyptian point of view, this would be
                            somewhat more convenient than the present practice of using fields in
                            Algeria and Sudan. For Egyptian purposes, El Adem is more conveniently
                            located than Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>20. To date, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has shown no
                            inclination to cultivate strong links with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Soviet diplomats have complained about difficulties
                            in gaining access to members of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            and about harassments by low ranking Libyan military personnel. A Soviet
                            offer of military assistance made in the days immediately after the
                            revolution was rejected. We doubt that the Libyans would see political
                            benefits in an arrangement giving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> access to either Wheelus Air Base or the British
                            facilities at Tobruk and El Adem on anything like extraterritorial terms
                            at such time as these are evacuated. Foreign bases, per se, are a
                            favorite target for Arab condemnation. On the other hand, the Libyans
                            would almost certainly be willing to grant the Soviets over flight and
                            landing rights and port visits as long as they were requested and
                            conducted in accordance with normal procedures. Over the longer run, it
                            is possible that Soviet-manned reconnaissance aircraft in some guise
                            (e.g., under Egyptian markings) might be permitted access to facilities
                            in Libya.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn5">The circumstances under which such

                        <p>21. The new regime in Libya clearly is determined to identify itself with
                            the militant Arab line toward Israel. Its principal weapon is money, and
                            it probably will be more generous than the monarchy. Payments pledged by
                            the monarchy included annual subsidies of $59 million to Egypt and $25
                            million to Jordan agreed to at Khartoum in 1967. Of a further $58
                            million promised to Egypt by <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName> in 1969, no more than half had been paid at the
                            time of the coup. Additional amounts for Egypt and Jordan are likely,
                            along with increased payments to fedayeen organizations; Libya
                            apparently made some new pledges at the Rabat conference in December
                            1969, but the exact amounts are not yet known. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> also may dispatch some troops to Egypt
                            and perhaps Jordan. These, however, will almost certainly be little more
                            than token contingents.</p>

                                NO REAL FUNCTION. I REPLIED THAT ARSEC HAS BEEN WORKING MOSTLY IN

                        </list>
                        <p>During our years at Wheelus Air Base, the U.S. Air Force helped the
                            Libyans get their own air force started. The rationale in 1965-1966 was
                            that this cooperation might provide the basis for continued U.S. use of
                            Wheelus. After 1967, the U.S. delivered ten F-5 aircraft (simple jets
                            designed for our military assistance program in less developed
                            countries), trained pilots for them and provided some basic
                            maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Now that our activities at Wheelus will be terminating in June, the U.S.
                            Air Force will no longer provide that basic support at Wheelus. The
                            question now arises: What kind of relationship should we substitute, if
                            any?</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and the Defense and State Departments recommend that the
                            Libyans be told: <list>
                                <item>- A US company (Norair) is prepared to contract with the
                                    Libyan government to provide full maintenance services for
                                    Libya's remaining seven F-5 aircraft.</item>
                                <item>- Northrup will continue to provide spares.</item>
                                <item>- The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is willing to go on
                                    selling reasonable amounts of ammunition for these
                                    planes.</item>
                                <item>- The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to train
                                    a few (7 or less) more Libyan pilots in the U.S. at Libyan
                                    expense.</item>
                                <item>- The U.S. will maintain a liaison unit of five <gloss
                                        target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> people in the embassy to
                                    facilitate the above.</item>
                                <item>- The commercial sale of 2 C-130s is proceeding.</item>

                        <p>The argument for this relationship is: <list>
                                <item>- This approach would eliminate our direct support for the
                                    Libyan Air Force and reduce it to commercial transactions plus
                                    limited training.</item>
                                <item>- It would maintain a minimal US relationship against the
                                    possibility that things may change in Libya. The French aircraft
                                    will not become operational in Libya even in small numbers for
                                    more than a year.</item>
                                <item>- It would preserve a sense of some continued cooperation with
                                    the Libyan government as a backdrop for preserving as quiet an
                                    atmosphere as possible for our oil companies.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The argument against this relationship lies more in the future than in
                            the present. This step is mainly shifting maintenance to a private
                            contract. However, on the basis of pre-1969 arrangements eight more
                            F-5's are scheduled for delivery at the end of this year. Following all
                            the attention to the French-Libyan deal, going through with this
                            delivery may well be politically impossible for us.</p>
                        <p>The question, therefore, is whether we should decide right now that we
                            will not be politically able to maintain a serious on-going relationship
                            with the Libyan air force and make a clean break.</p>
                        <p>On balance, there is something to be said for moving gradually and
                            waiting out the situation a while longer.</p>

                            trends in the Middle East. Foremost among these has been the growing
                            involvement of all Arab states in the Palestine issue. This has meant,
                            for the most part, joining the conflict against Israel or at least
                            supporting it. US prestige and influence in the Arab world has been
                            inversely related to this trend; from a high point of good will reached
                            as a result of President EISENHOWER's actions in the 1956 Suez war, the
                            course has been generally downward. The June 1967 war accelerated this
                            trend, and a sharp drop followed the US decision in early 1969 to supply
                            F-4 Phantom jets to Israel. Even the seven Arab states that could then
                            have been characterized as political moderates or conservatives and had
                            retained <pb n="3" xml:id="d53-03" facs="d53-03"/>diplomatic relations
                            with the US found it politically necessary to denounce the US publicly.
                            The actual delivery of the aircraft and their subsequent highly
                            publicized use in combat have led the Arab press to portray the US as a
                            supporter and ally of Israel and the primary enemy of the Arabs.</p>

                        <p>2. The members of the Revolutionary Command Council that installed itself
                            in Libya in September 1969 were bound together by a common desire to
                            overthrow King <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>, who was for
                            them a symbol of corruption, the presence of foreign bases, and a too
                            strong pro-West stance. They are young, inexperienced officers between
                            the ages of 25 and 30, and have only vague ties to the various pan-Arab
                            ideological movements. Although they proclaimed appropriate slogans in
                            the early hours of their coup, they have not as yet developed a clear
                            and agreed upon political program. Libya's new rulers are seized both by
                            an enthusiasm for Arab nationalism and by a desire to modernize their
                            country. They have neither the expertise nor the machinery to make and
                            carry out decisions in an orderly manner, thus they are likely to be
                            caught up in cycles of failure and frustration.</p>
                        <p>3. The power relationship within the junta remains largely unknown.
                            Although Muammir Qaddafi has been named council president, prime
                            minister, and commander in chief of the armed forces, he does not appear
                            to be all powerful. The available evidence suggests that the 12-man
                            council, all of whose members have finally been publicly identified,
                            acts as a collegial group. There may also be other officers in the armed
                            forces who have a special relationship with and access to the council.
                            Recent evidence also suggests that the council has pro- and
                            anti-Egyptian factions with the former presently in the ascendancy.</p>
                        <p>4. The junta members, who were suspicious of the ease with which they
                            were able to oust the King, still are insecure. To date, however, the
                            junta has been challenged only by its own members. In December 1969, the
                            ministers of defense and interior were arrested before they could make a
                            planned move against <pb n="4" xml:id="d53-04" facs="d53-04"/>their
                            colleagues. There have been reports of discontent among the tribes of
                            Cyrenaica and elsewhere in the civilian sector. These groups do not
                            possess sufficient arms to challenge the army seriously, accordingly in
                            the present situation they do not appear to pose any real danger to the
                            regime. Under present circumstances, any move against the regime is
                            likely to come from within the army. The junta has begun transferring
                            units of the armed forces that seem most likely to become
                            troublesome—the Cyrenaicans—to Egypt for training and eventual duty
                            along the Suez Canal. Thus far, approximately 2,600 men have been sent
                            to Egypt, with another 1,900 scheduled to join them before the end of
                            February.</p>
                        <p>5. Perhaps of far more significance than this is the movement of Egyptian
                            troops into Libya, an operation that began in December. Some 1,500 to
                            2,000 Egyptian soldiers are now stationed in Benghazi and Tripoli.
                            Approximately 500 other Egyptians have been assigned to military,
                            security, and communications posts. Thus, the Egyptians may be in enough
                            key points to forestall any countercoup by indigenous elements. In the
                            event of foreign moves to topple the regime, these Egyptian units could
                            probably be considered as controlling an air- or beach-head through
                            which additional forces could be moved into Libya.</p>

                        <p>6. For Libya's new rulers, there is no obvious conflict between Libyan
                            and Arab nationalism. One of the first statements issued by the junta
                            was an attack on King Idris for his relatively passive attitude toward
                            the Palestinian guerrilla movement and the Arab-Israeli conflict. In
                            fact, however, there had been some support of the Arab cause by Idris.
                            The Palestine Liberation Organization was allowed to carry out a number
                            of activities in Libya, and sizable official contributions had been made
                            to it. By the end of 1969 Libya had also contributed more than $200
                            million to Egypt and Jordan, but for the junta this was not enough.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d53-05" facs="d53-05"/>
                        <p>7. At the recent Arab summit conference in Rabat, Qaddafi was most vocal
                            in his demands that wealthy Arab states increase their commitment to the
                            struggle against Israel. As proof of its own commitment the Libya
                            leadership now has decided to grant Egypt $96 million in addition to its
                            annual subsidy of $59 million. Another symbol of Libya's commitment to
                            the Arab war effort is its transfer of troops to Egypt, even though this
                            also serves as a convenient way to remove possible dissidents.</p>
                        <p>8. Upon seizing power, the council announced that it would honor existing
                            oil concessions, which brought in revenues last year that may have
                            amounted to $1.2 billion, and the oil companies report that operations
                            in Libya have continued without significant harassment. In January the
                            Libyan Government began negotiations with a number of operating oil
                            companies, including some US corporations. These talks aim at securing
                            higher posted prices on which government revenues are based. The
                            companies are being threatened with unspecified punitive actions if they
                            fail to reach an agreement. Nationalization, always the ultimate
                            possibility, has not been raised by the new Libyan rulers and at this
                            point does not appear to enter the picture. Indeed, Libyan commitments
                            to purchase a sizable number of French aircraft and promises of more aid
                            to Egypt and Jordan would suggest that Libya cannot afford to engage in
                            adventurism in its oil arrangements.</p>
                        <p>9. So far, given the quick US decision to meet Libyan demands for the
                            evacuation of Wheelus Air Base, official relations have not been overly
                            difficult. Certain irritations have arisen, however, and the Libyans
                            have so far failed to delineate the nature and the form of the military
                            assistance relationship they profess to desire. This may have to await
                            complete evacuation of the base, because the Libyans continue to be
                            highly suspicious of US and British intentions.</p>
                        <p>10. To date, the junta has kept the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            at arms length. The Soviets offered military assistance in the first few
                            days of the coup, but were quickly rejected. As far as we know,
                            subsequent approaches <pb n="6" xml:id="d53-06" facs="d53-06"/>have also
                            been rebuffed. This negative attitude of the Libyans may be reinforced
                            by the advice reportedly offered by Nasir not to become dependent upon
                            the Soviets for support. France, seeing a big power vacuum in Libya and
                            aware of the economic advantages available, is seeking to fill that void
                            partly. Paris' future intentions are unclear, other than its obvious
                            desire to increase its influence all along the North African littoral.
                            The Maghreb states, which are themselves moving toward a closer
                            relationship with France, probably hope that the growing role of France
                            in Libya is a force that will help preserve Libya's Maghreb
                            orientation.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">The Junta and its Future</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. The life expectancy of the junta will ultimately depend upon several
                            factors. First and foremost, the junta must guard against serious
                            dissidence within its own ranks. In December 1969, Qaddafi had to act
                            quickly to a potential threat from within the junta. Coup attempts are
                            also possible by either members of the former ruling clique or other
                            disaffected civilian groups; however because they lack cohesion and an
                            effective power base, their chances of dislodging the junta are minimal.
                            Moreover, Nasir is apparently willing to give support in preventing any
                            effort of this type. Over the longer run, the rulers of Libya need to
                            find ways to encourage popular support. To be sure, much mileage will be
                            gained from publicizing the removal of Western military forces from the
                            country and the use of the US as a whipping boy for Arab military
                            shortcomings. Public attention, however, cannot be diverted from
                            domestic problems forever. Such civilian support as there is for the
                            regime comes from professional men, university graduates, lower grade
                            military officers, lower level government officials, and
                            students—precisely the same elements that were the most disaffected
                            under the monarchy. Having proclaimed its intention to modernize Libya
                            and rid it of the evil vestiges of the old regime, the junta will have
                            to show some signs of making good its promise.</p>
                        <p>12. Another factor is the relationship between the junta and Egypt. At
                            some point, it could well <pb n="7" xml:id="d53-07" facs="d53-07"
                            />become a liability to both parties. At present it would be difficult
                            for opponents of the regime to attack its close cooperation with Egypt
                            without being accused of hampering the struggle against the Israelis. As
                            the relationship is maintained—and perhaps expanded—the presence of
                            large numbers of Egyptian advisers and troops in Libya could become a
                            source of irritation. A growing realization that financial resources
                            that could be used for internal development are being sent outside Libya
                            could add to public discontent. For the Egyptians, the tangible benefits
                            accruing from their present relationship are important. If the junta
                            maintains power and acquires a substantial arms inventory, Libyan
                            military equipment might eventually represent a contingency asset for
                            Cairo. During the next few years, however, Egyptian ability to
                            assimilate more sophisticated weapons will remain limited, and Libyan
                            arms will be of far less significance to Nasir than Libyan financial
                            support.</p>
                        <p>13. With the passage of time, increased self-confidence and experience
                            may make the Libyan junta more independent minded. Moreover, recalling
                            his previous difficulties in Syria and Yemen, Nasir himself may come to
                            have second thoughts about extensive involvement with the Libyan regime.
                            Whatever the course of Libyan-Egyptian relations and internal Libyan
                            politics, the junta's policy is likely to remain militantly anti-Israel.
                            This is probably the one important issue on which few Libyans would
                            disagree. Although Libya's business relations with the US will probably
                            be correct, Tripoli will be largely hostile, or at least cool, toward
                            the US which it will view as the chief mainstay of Israel.</p>

                                appropriate for you to use an occasion to go over this one lightly
                                with at least Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>?

                                our colleagues in State would be appreciative of your intervention.
                                However, all of us expect that if the F-5s are sold as agreed, there
                                would be almost insurmountable pressures to sell Phantoms to Israel.
                                If the government is not prepared to resist these pressures, it
                                would be better not to go through with the F-5 agreement.</item>

                                decided that we should take following positions re <gloss

                                of his Washington visit with principal emphasis on desire <gloss

                                government had in mind the professions of desire for a new
                                relationship after we agreed to leave Wheelus. Instead we have
                                experienced moves against both the official and private American
                                community. We have not seen the development of the new relationship

                                desire or intention to interfere in its internal affairs. We would
                                hope this could be reciprocated by a lessening of the apparent
                                suspicion directed toward us by some in the Libyan

                                take any prejudicial action at this time. Consequently, we have
                                taken a deliberate decision not to invoke Clause A-6 of the letter
                                of offer at this time but to make our decision on the basis of the
                                general area situation and the developing relationships between the
                                two countries much closer to the time of actual delivery.</item>

                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Oil is Libya's Major Diplomatic Weapon.</hi>
                            Concern over the ultimate intentions of the present Libyan Government
                            toward the mainly American and British-owned oil industry in Libya
                            appears well justified: the ruling junta is clearly no friend of the
                            international “majors” and is almost certainly considering a number of
                            a1ternative solutions to Libya's 3 present heavy dependence on those
                            companies (as evidenced by Libya's recent contacts with the Soviets and
                            other Eastern Europeans, the French, and the A1gerians). However, in
                            connection with the current negotiations over the “posted” or
                            tax-reference price of crude oil, it seems unlikely that the Libyans
                            would move against foreign equity interests in the industry as a
                            whole—by total or partial nationalization, by sequestration, or by
                            general revocation of concessions.</p>
                        <p>Libyan Prime Minister Mu'amar QADHAAFI probably views western (US, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and to a lesser extent <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) equity interests in Libyan oil as the
                            most important remaining hostage to the anti-Israel cause, and he
                            probably would not squander his highest trump card, unless and until he
                            were to reach the conclusions (a) that cooperation of any sort with the
                            pro-Israel Western states is counterproductive to the cause and (b) that
                            he could nationalize <pb n="2" xml:id="d58-02" facs="d58-02"/>the oil
                            interests of these states without military or subversive moves against
                            his regime.</p>
                        <p>There is little evidence that he has reached either conclusion. On the
                            first point, Libya is continuing to seek some limited military
                            cooperation with the US as well as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Furthermore, QADHAAFI has just
                            launched an inter-Arab diplomatic initiative for his own, as yet
                            undisclosed, plan for the settlement of the Arab-Israeli confrontation.
                            Given the great influence on QADHAAFI of UAR President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">NASSER</persName>, this “QADHAAFI plan” (although
                            almost certainly calling for strong Arab pressures against the US)
                            probably also reflects <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            waning hopes for a political settlement based on US influence over
                            Israel. Unless and until <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            called on Libya to take all-out action against US interests, QADHAAFI is
                            not likely to act rashly against the US oil interests in Libya. On the
                            latter point, QADHAAFI would in any case move extremely cautiously until
                            after the complete evacuation of American forces from Wheelus Air Base,
                            now scheduled for mid-June. On balance, and assuming that the Arab cause
                            does not deteriorate dramatically during this period, QADHAAFI probably
                            will not nationalize the industry as a whole over the next few
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Some Companies Are More Vulnerable Than
                                Others.</hi> On the other hand, the Libyans will almost certainly
                            continue to harass, threaten, and restrict individual companies in
                            different ways (such as the recent production limitations imposed on
                            Occidental). There is probably at least an even chance that the Libyans
                            will move soon against the equity interests of one or more American oil
                            companies (most likely, by the revocation of <pb n="3" xml:id="d58-03"
                                facs="d58-03"/>individual concession agreements), partly to settle
                            old scores and partly to pressure the rest of the industry into moving
                            toward an acceptable solution to the posted price issue. Many
                            Libyans—particularly chief oil negotiator and former Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMS1">Mahmud MAGHRABI</persName>—are convinced
                            that a number of companies (notably Occidental) engaged in flagrant
                            corruption not only in obtaining their original concessions, but also in
                            their other operational problems with the royalist government. Some of
                            the companies were associated very closely in one way or another with
                            now discredited officials of the former regime, some of whom have been
                            actively plotting against the present regime. There are many skeletons
                            in the closet, and, depending on which facts are known to and considered
                            important by the Libyans, a number of companies are undoubtedly
                            vulnerable to individual action. Furthermore, some companies may also be
                            subject to Libyan action for failure (by the present government's
                            stricter standards) to comply with their legal obligations under their
                            concession agreements and related regulations. Thus, action against any
                            one company over these next few weeks need not, and probably will not,
                            indicate Libyan intentions to move against the industry as a whole.</p>

                            Paragraph C of the Economic Assistance Agreement (the State position),
                            or whether the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has paid more than
                            legally required (the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> position
                            constructed from the negotiating history). While the Legal Adviser's
                            Office has accepted the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> position as
                            a plausible legal argument, it believes the more persuasive conclusion
                            is that the timing of the payments, as well as their totality, were in
                            consideration for Wheelus and that the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> is therefore obligated under Paragraph C of the
                            Agreement to pay $1,000,000 for 1968 and $906,840 for 1969 (the pro rata
                            amount through <pb n="2" xml:id="d59-02" facs="d59-02"/>November 19).
                            This amount could, of course, be offset by any valid claim which we
                            determined to exist and decided to press under international law arising
                            out of early termination of our effective use of Wheelus and other areas
                            at <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the view, based on recent consultations with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>, that
                            submission of the current <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position
                            would not be beneficial to overall <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            interests. We believe that it would be difficult to present, inasmuch as
                            it could not be supported by any written understanding with the Libyan
                            Government, and that it would almost certainly become the object of a
                            dispute. One possible <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> reaction
                            would be the demand that unpaid amounts under the Economic Assistance
                            Agreement be offset against the $7,000,000 due the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> under the 1967 F-5 contract. Another
                            reaction would be the contentious filing of claims in connection with
                            Wheelus withdrawal prior to the June 30, 1971 deadline provided in the
                            December 23, 1969 Agreed Minute.</p>
                        <p>The policy rationale underlying our decision to withdraw from Wheelus AFB
                            was based on our desire to remove an important stumbling block from
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> relations and to develop a fresh start. Having made
                            this basic decision, we believe it important to complete our final
                            withdrawal in a manner which promotes rather than detracts from this
                            objective. Such has been our conduct in other areas of the Wheelus
                            withdrawal. The Libyans have fulfilled their understanding thus far to
                            facilitate our withdrawal. Adherence to our present position would, in
                            our view, be inconsistent with our general policy. Despite uncertainties
                            in our relationship with Libya at this time, and in recognition of the
                            importance of other US interests in that country, we wish to avoid
                            positions on Wheelus, where possible, which we consider likely to
                            adversely affect our overall interests.</p>

                        <p>I would therefore appreciate your looking into this matter in the light
                            of the above points and would hope that you could concur in the attached
                            draft telegram which would authorize the Ambassador to acknowledge that
                            we owe $1,906,840 under the Economic Assistance Agreement but reserve
                            our right to present any valid claim we may wish to present under
                            international law and our intention of including this amount in the
                            discussion of other outstanding financial questions in the near future.
                            There is some urgency to this as we should send revised instructions to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> before the

                            <p>On June 11 the U.S. formally turned over Wheelus Air Force Base to

                                transferred command to the Libyan Air Force and the last 48 <gloss

                                departed for Germany.</p>
                            <p>Under the Wheelus Agreement all permanent constructions reverted to
                                the Libyan Government without compensation. This property cost $77
                                million at initial construction and is currently valued at $43
                                million after depreciation. During the withdrawal the <gloss

                                and $750,000 worth of aircraft fuel to the Libyan Government for
                                which full payment has been received. Over 4,000 airmen and
                                dependents were also withdrawn. Previous Wheelus functions (as a
                                weapons and gunnery training facility for <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                    >USAF</gloss> Europe-based tactical aircraft) have now been

                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has apparently renamed
                                Wheelus “Ukba ibn Nafia”, after the 7th century Arab conqueror of
                                North Africa (who also expelled the Christians from there). The

                                intended use of Wheelus other than to declare that it will be used
                                “to defend Arabism and humanity”. It has repeatedly denied that it
                                would allow control of former U.S. and U.K. bases to pass to
                                “foreigners”.</p>

                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>
                            <lb/>Under Secretary for Political Affairs<lb/>Department of
                            State<lb/>Washington, D. C. 20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Alex:</p>
                        <p>I am replying to your letter of June 2nd about possible payments due to
                            the Libyan Government, under the 1954 Economic Assistance Agreement, as
                            a quid pro quo for the use of Wheelus through November 1969. Given the
                            differing views of Counsel, I believe it would be an error to give the
                            Libyans any statement to the effect that we owe them anything under the
                            Economic Assistance Agreement. I should add that our lawyers remain
                            convinced that we do not have a legal obligation to pay the amounts in
                            question, and I do not think that we should be reluctant to explain to
                            the Libyans that our records show that the payments agreed under the
                            Economic Assistance Agreement in 1954 represented an average annual quid
                            pro quo of $2 million.</p>
                        <p>As a practical matter, I would recommend against any further payments
                            regardless of how one comes out of the legal question in view of our
                            claim for damages resulting from our forced, pre-mature withdrawal from
                            Wheelus. That claim exceeds, and thus cancels out, the $1.9 million that
                            the Libyans might argue are due under the Economic Assistance
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> be instructed accordingly.</p>

                            >Palmer</persName>'s recommendations for the forthcoming negotiations
                            with the Libyan Government (Tab B), we request Circular 175 authority
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to
                            negotiate and terminate, with one exception, all <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>-Libyan Government agreements currently in force. Both
                            Governments would reserve their respective legal positions regarding any
                            claims which may have arisen under international law in connection with
                            these agreements prior to their termination.</p>
                        <p>We believe this course of action desirable for the following reasons: (a)
                            amicable termination of the agreements may provide us with some leverage
                            with the Libyan Government which we believe is anxious to terminate
                            existing agreements, particularly the Wheelus Base, Economic Assistance
                            and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Agreements; (b) wiping the
                            slate clean of agreements negotiated with the former Monarchy shows our
                            willingness to respond to repeated Libyan assertions that such an action
                            is a necessary pre-condition for a new Us-<gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> relationship; (c) such a gesture may provide support
                            for those in Libyan Government councils who may be arguing for a
                            continuing relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                            For this reason, an important ingredient in our negotiations is the
                            tentative “post-aid” technical assistance proposals which we authorize
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to put
                            forward. (We have obtained agreement from <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> and the US Geological Survey to make certain
                            proposals.)</p>

                                        agreement, authority is needed to amend his instructions
                                        regarding the settlement of financial obligations under this
                                        Agreement. We have reached a compromise with Defense which
                                        we believe can be satisfactorily put forward to the Libyans,
                                        at least through the next negotiating round. Our strategy
                                        entails maneuvering the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                            >LARG</gloss> into balancing all the claims which it

                                        including any claim for payment of our obligations under the
                                        Economic Assistance Agreement, against a possible claim we
                                        will lay on the table for costs (which we are still
                                        determining) resulting from the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                            >LARG</gloss>'s denial of our effective use of Wheelus
                                        AFB after November 19, 1969. The amount of this possible

                                    agreements. Libya became an “aid-graduate” country in 1965 and
                                    several of these agreements are no longer operative. Despite the
                                    fact that some provisions of one of the agreements could be
                                    theoretically beneficial to future activities of American

                                    immunities), on balance we believe it desirable to terminate
                                    these agreements for the following reasons: (a) since the <gloss
                                        target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has indicated its opposition
                                    to their continuation, we believe we would have difficulty in
                                    securing <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> cooperation in

                                    projects; (b) we believe the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                        >LARG</gloss> would be receptive at this point only to a
                                    pragmatic, ad hoc approach to technical assistance; (c) possible
                                    service agencies (<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>S and
                                        <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>) indicate that the
                                    termination of these agreements would not affect their current
                                    authority to operate in Libya, and that they would be able to
                                    negotiate on an ad hoc basis for necessary <gloss

                            agreements would have little or no adverse effect on US programs, and we
                            believe it could have important advantages in laying the psychological
                            basis for a new “post-Wheelus” phase in <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>-Libyan relations. Our gesture towards a “post-aid”
                            relationship is an important step in responding directly to a Libyan
                            national interest and thus could be helpful to our efforts to protect
                            our substantial interests in the Libyan oil industry.</p>

                        <p>Libya became independent in 1951 and formed its first army in 1953. In
                            September 1969, an army coup replaced the monarchy with a Revolutionary
                            Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) headed by Colonel
                            Muammar Qaddafi. Before the coup, all weapons and military equipment
                            were of Western origin, primarily British and US, acquired through
                            purchase and grant aid worth in all about $75 million. Since the coup in
                            1969, Libya has drastically reduced its dependence upon the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US, has concluded a shaky
                            $400-million military-economic deal with France, and has received
                            clandestine deliveries of Soviet-made tanks from Egypt, as well as the
                            recent overt deliveries of tanks and other equipment via two Soviet
                            freighters. The 1970 Libyan defense budget is $245.5 million, about 21
                            percent of the total budget.</p>

                                equipment worth over $40 million, including tanks, armored cars,
                                artillery, small-arms, and naval ships. Some of this has not been
                                delivered; Libya has changed its mind about some items, and the

                            <item>Britain was instrumental in setting up the Libyan Army and
                                paramilitary forces through a military mission that was part of a

                                of government last year. Libya had previously regarded the agreement
                                primarily as a defense against Egypt. When the new government
                                patterned itself on Nasir's and brought in Egyptian troops and
                                security men to help sustain it, there was no longer any need for a
                                Western defender. This alienation from Western influence made the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wary of delivering its best
                                tanks into pro-Egyptian hands. London's new Tory government will
                                probably re-examine the order and may conclude that since British
                                tanks might pre-empt further Soviet deliveries, British commercial
                                interests should benefit from the sale. At present, only a small

                                impact. In January 1970, Paris announced the conclusion of a
                                military-economic assistance program that included the eventual sale
                                of 110 Mirage aircraft. The package was estimated at some $400
                                million. Despite pressure from Israel and the US, as well as from
                                domestic public opinion, Paris seized the opportunity of making the
                                sale to increase French prestige and influence in the Arab world and
                                reap the economic advantages that this seemed to entail. In
                                justifying their decision, the French argued that a vacuum existed

                                the Soviet Union. In any event, the equipment has been delivered by
                                Egyptian ships, and it has been manned by Egyptian personnel. It
                                consists of two or three ex-Soviet minesweepers and an estimated 65

                                transferred its own Naval Academy out of enemy range in Alexandria

                            <item>This program of military assistance has been supplemented by
                                political discussions concerning some form of tripartite union
                                between Egypt, Libya, and Sudan. To date any such “union” is without
                                substance, and the initial steps toward it have dealt largely with
                                economic cooperation. In short, it was believed that Nasir wished to
                                establish a relationship with Libya that would enable him to derive

                                now the Libyans had appeared to hold Moscow politely at arms'
                                length. Nasir is reported to have advised Libya in March to deal
                                with the French rather than the Soviets in order to bind Paris more
                                closely to the Arab cause. More recently, Soviet pressure on Nasir

                        <p>The introduction of Soviet medium tanks and armored personnel carriers
                            into Libya directly from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on
                            July 20-22 has not in itself significantly altered the arms balance in
                            the region. However, we are concerned over its implications for the
                            future of US-Libyan relations, and are therefore asking Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to return to
                            Washington for consultations.</p>
                        <p>Downgraded at 12-year intervals, not automatically declassified.</p>
                        <p>The tanks involved are medium models, more sophisticated than those
                            previously in the Libyan inventory. Our intelligence indicates that they
                            came directly from the Soviet Union. Their delivery follows a British
                            refusal to supply the Chieftain tanks contracted for by the old regime
                            and inconclusive <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> negotiations for
                            French and West German models. Although we have no information on the
                            extent of any Libyan-Soviet agreements covering the deliveries, the way
                            is clearly opened for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            become a significant supplier of the Libyan armed forces and possibly to
                            establish a training mission in Libya. This would make sense in Libyan
                            terms, since the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council suspects both the
                            US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as being hostile to the regime,
                            unreliable suppliers, and pro-Israeli. The fact that we have not
                            indicated that we will deliver the eight F-5s to Libya for which they
                            have a valid contract strengthens this Libyan impression of us. The
                            British find themselves in the same position inasmuch as they have
                            suspended indefinitely any action on the delivery of 188 <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d64-02" facs="d64-02"/>Chieftain tanks for which the Libyans
                            also have a valid contract. (Both contracts, of course, were signed with
                            the old regime.)</p>
                        <p>The purchase of Soviet equipment is also consistent with the strong
                            pro-UAR attitude of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s leader,
                            Colonel QADHAAFI. In fact, purchase of the Soviet equipment may have
                            been stimulated by the Egyptians, who have been urging other Arab
                            nations to accept Soviet offers of military equipment. Moreover,
                            purchase of the Soviet equipment would be consistent with the Libyan
                            regime's policy of “unity” with Egypt and Sudan, whose armed forces are
                            Soviet-equipped.</p>
                        <p>We still have two significant interests in Libya we wish to preserve: our
                            important stake in the petroleum industry, and our diplomatic presence.
                            The consultations with the Ambassador would be designed to obtain his
                            considered estimate of the chances of their survival over the near and
                            mid-term.</p>

                        <p>In an up-dating of the December 1969 National Intelligence Estimate
                                (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>) 36.5-69, prepared on 6 May
                            1970, the Office of National Estimates concluded that the earlier
                            assessment which stated that “the main interests of the U.S. are not
                            endangered by the new government in Libya” remained valid but conceded
                            that “there are, however, many potential problem spots in U.S.-Libyan
                            relations.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>,
                            reporting in a message to the Department of State on 8 June 1970,
                            concluded: “On balance, we see no hard evidence at this time that the
                            Libyan Government (<gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>) intends a
                            precipitate early break in relations, except as it may see its options
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="d66-05" facs="d66-05"/>foreclosed by some
                            development in the Middle East area or our Middle East policy.”</p>
                        <p>In spite of these cautiously optimistic judgments, the public posture of
                            the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) has been increasingly hostile to U.S. interests in
                            Libya; the Egyptian presence in Libya has grown, and the Libyans have
                            taken modest steps to expand their relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. While maintaining a rather
                            inflexible position in negotiations with the oil companies on posted
                            prices, the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has harassed
                            Occidental Petroleum and Amoseas by decreeing sharp cutbacks in
                            production and blocked exports on liquified natural gas from Esso's
                            newly completed plant. Steps have been taken toward closer coordination
                            of policies with the UAR and Sudan, and UAR military forces and training
                            facilities in Libya have reportedly been augmented. Partially as a
                            bargaining tactic with the U.S. oil companies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> flirted with the Soviet Union by
                            sending its Minister of Petroleum to Moscow and welcoming a Soviet
                            geological survey team in Libya shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>In none of these areas has there been a significant development that
                            dramatically alters the situation that existed in February 1970 when the
                            [text not declassfied] approved Option 1-A. Events in the Middle East
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="d66-06" facs="d66-06"/>during this period have,
                            however, produced a further erosion in the U.S. position. The policies
                            of the Libyan regime vis-à-vis the United States will be significantly
                            influenced by the course of the Middle East crisis surrounding the
                            Arab-Israel war and the Palestine problem. For example, a decision to
                            sell Phantoms to Israel, or a decision not to deliver those F-5's for
                            which the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has contracted, will
                            have an important impact on U.S.-Libya relations.</p>

                                    surveillance of foreign missions greatly restrict foreign

                                    these factors, outsiders have little if any capability to guide,

                        </list>
                        <p>State has sent over for your attention a file of cables (Tab A) which
                            raise the possibility of some form of armed intervention in Libya by a
                            combined group of Libyan exiles and mercenaries. The consensus of State
                            and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is that this activity, if it
                            takes place, is designed essentially to free certain figures prominent
                            under the old regime from prison. The plotters are billing it as a coup
                            attempt but from their description it is most likely a foray to release
                            political prisoners or a crude provocation.</p>
                        <p>The conspirators have sought our help but we have made it clear that we
                            have no desire to become involved in this operation. Their plot,
                            according to our embassy in Tripoli, seems doomed to political
                            self-defeat and even if successful would only result in the release of
                            detention of a group of undesirables anyway. More importantly if we were
                            suspected of involvement by the Government we could expect a “violent
                            reaction” and strong reaction against our interests in Libya. The
                            embassy concludes that “the operation only makes sense for the
                            instigator and possibly one of his jailed friends, certainly not for the
                            U.S. or West generally.”</p>
                        <p>All contacts with the plotters have been broken off and precautions are
                            being taken to insure that no U.S. military activity could inadvertently
                            be connected with the operation should it take place. <gloss

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> has again been
                            pressed by the Commander of the Libyan Air Force for an immediate
                            decision on the F-5s for Libya. The Libyan Commander has indicated his
                            awareness that the aircraft are virtually ready for delivery. He stated
                            that he had waited “long enough” and that he now had to know where he
                            stood. He concluded by saying that if the decision was not communicated
                            to him shortly, he would have to bring the “<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> back into the act”. The Ambassador has urged that we
                            respond by January 8.</p>
                        <p>The policy issues at stake remain unchanged since this subject was
                            outlined in my memorandum of December 4, 1970 to the Acting Secretary
                            (attached). <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> continues to share

                            it would be in the national interest for us to deliver the planes.</p>

                        <p>The eight Northrop <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss>-5 fighter aircraft
                            which the United States agreed to sell the previous Libyan regime in
                            June 1969 will leave the production line this December. They will be
                            ready for delivery on schedule in January and February. Officially, we
                            have had “under review” since March the question of whether it would be
                            in our interest to deliver these aircraft. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> believes strongly that we must
                            now decide this question since he may be asked by the Libyans at any
                            time regarding our intentions and he cannot indefinitely indicate that
                            no decision has been made. Defense has also asked for a decision
                            regarding the disposition of these planes in order to complete its
                            programming for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>A decision on this subject could conceivably be delayed until perhaps
                            March by disposing of these eight planes through the military assistance
                            program to another recipient than Libya, and by earmarking another eight
                            for delivery to Libya before the summer of 1971. <gloss target="#t_AF1"
                                >AF</gloss> does not believe the chances of a change for the better
                            in our bilateral relations with Libya or in the Middle East situation
                            between now and March are significant enough to warrant a continued
                            postponement of a decision. Although as noted below <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> is in agreement in principle with going
                            ahead with delivery, it <pb n="3" xml:id="d69-03" facs="d69-03"/>points
                            out that a decision to proceed at this time would probably result in an
                            adverse reaction from Congress thus jeopardizing the pending <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 supplemental request for military
                            assistance funds. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> therefore makes its
                            concurrence in this memo contingent on the supplemental request.</p>
                        <p>Defense has also raised the possibility of delivering the eight F-5s to
                            Libya out of the production of Northrup's Spanish licensee. Such
                            deliveries would, however, still require United States approval, and
                            those who object to delivery in principle would no doubt feel that this
                            procedure was merely a subterfuge.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador believes that we should deliver the eight planes on
                            schedule to Libya under the contract of June 1969. <gloss
                                target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            agree with him. NEA does not.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for delivering the planes are several.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>- We have a valid contract with the Libyan Government, although it
                                was signed with the pre-revolution regime. The contract does contain
                                a “changed circumstances” clause which L believes could be invoked
                                to justify non-delivery (see attachment.) However, <gloss
                                    target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> believes that doing so would set an
                                undesirable precedent and cast doubts on our role as a reliable
                                military supplier.</item>
                            <item>- Militarily, the eight planes are inconsequential in the Middle
                                East situation. Their flying range is limited and logistical support
                                of them in a combat zone over the canal would be either difficult or
                                impossible. Libyan pilot and mechanic skills are limited severely in
                                number and quality. Even with these planes Libya would have only 18
                                fighters.</item>
                            <item>- Politically, the delivery of the planes might reassure the
                                Libyan regime regarding our intentions toward it. Failure to fulfill
                                the contract would eliminate for a long time any basis for mutual
                                confidence that may exist. It could also provoke retaliation by the
                                regime against our diplomatic presence in Libya, and, at worst,
                                cause a break in relations with the last <pb n="4" xml:id="d69-04"
                                    facs="d69-04"/>“radical” Arab regime with which we have such
                                relations. Less likely, but still possible, would be a retaliation
                                against the American oil interest. Non-fulfillment would certainly
                                confirm to the regime its conviction that our policy toward the Arab
                                world is negative and toward Israel, positive.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>NEA does not disagree basically with the foregoing reasoning. However, it
                            believes that: <list>
                                <item>- We would encounter substantial Congressional, press and
                                    public criticism for “arming” a government which advocates a
                                    military solution to the Palestine problem and has been
                                    increasingly unfriendly in its attitude toward the United
                                    States. This criticism would be increased as a result of the
                                    political federation of Libya with the UAR and Sudan which Syria
                                    has now joined. H, in general, shares this estimate of the
                                    possible Congressional reaction.</item>
                                <item>- Israel, and its friends in the United States, would demand
                                    still more military assistance to offset the addition to Libya's
                                    air force, thus adding to pressures for escalation in military
                                    supply to the area.</item>
                                <item>- Libya does not need the planes for its defense. Its defense
                                    needs will be more than met by the purchase of a substantial
                                    number of French Mirages, delivery of which should begin soon.
                                    Critics of the F-5 transaction would make this point.
                                    (Originally, about 104 Mirages were ordered, but this number may
                                    be reduced to 60, according to unconfirmed intelligence
                                    reports.)</item>
                                <item>- Libyan preoccupation with our Middle East policy means that
                                    there is little we can do under present circumstances that is
                                    likely to change their attitude toward us basically. Despite our
                                    withdrawal from Wheelus, our attempts to maintain good relations
                                    have been basically one-sided.</item>
                                <item>- Deliveries of aircraft to Libya, in light of its closer
                                    relation with the UAR, in effect are deliveries to Egypt. Even
                                    the French are beginning to get concerned that further moves
                                    toward federation raise serious questions regarding Libya's
                                    commitment that the Mirages would not fall into third party
                                    hands and not be used in the Arab-Israel dispute. Libya is in no
                                    position to give such an assurance to the United States and,
                                    even if it did, it would be meaningless.</item>

                        </p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d69-05" facs="d69-05"/>
                        <p>NEA's view is shared at the staff level of the White House which regards
                            the possible disadvantages of fulfilling the contract as outweighing the
                            possible advantages of doing so.</p>
                        <p>Some consideration has been given to the possibility of delivery of the
                            planes to the Libyans on the condition that they transfer them and the
                            nine F-5s they now have to Tunisia through a bilateral arrangement with
                            that country after 17 Mirages had been delivered to Libya. NEA and H do
                            not believe this arrangement would off set the adverse public and
                            Congressional reaction that would be generated if we were to go through
                            with the deal now, or deflect increased Israeli demands on us. Defense
                            would have no objection in principle to the arrangement but notes that
                            it could not provide the funds that might be needed to make it work.
                            (Tunisian financial resources are sharply limited.)</p>
                        <p>Thus, the basic question is whether the U.S. interest would be best
                            served by (a) informing the Department of Defense that delivery of the
                            F-5s to Libya is to be made on schedule, or (b) informing the Department
                            of Defense that the contract is not to be fulfilled. Your approval of
                            one of these two options is requested below.</p>
                        <p>If the decision is to deliver the aircraft, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> would have to notify the
                            Libyan Government so that arrangements may be made by the Libyan Air
                            Force to receive them. If the decision is negative, the tactics and
                            timing of informing the Libyans would be left to Ambassador <persName

                            <item>One of the most immediate problems facing us is: “Who is making
                                the decisions in Libya?” I have not seen any reporting from the
                                Embassy that suggests that JALLUD has been downgraded and that the
                                relatively unknown Sulieman Qaradha (formerly Qaddafils private
                                secretary) and Al Huni are the dominant influences on foreign policy
                                — including the critical decisions that lie ahead on Libya's role in
                                the oil world. [text not declassfied] Does <gloss target="#t_OCI1"
                                    >OCI</gloss> have a clear view of this situation?</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>It is possible that the four OPEC producers in the Mediterranean
                                will reach agreement on guidelines which will then be the basis for
                                the individual country negotiations with the individual companies;
                                this is apparently what the Libyans have in mind. The positions of
                                the Libyans and the oil companies appear to be too widely separated
                                to be easily bridged by the complicated process of negotiations now
                                prospect. [text not declassfied] If pressures develop in this
                                process, it is clear that the wings are fairly crowded with parties
                                that are anxious to rush on stage and play a role in exploiting the
                                shaky situation which may develop. The British, some of the
                                Europeans (Germany and Italy for example), the Egyptians, the
                                Israelis, the Libyan exiles and, finally, the Soviets have
                                objectives and interests in Libya which, in the present context, are
                                not congruent with those of the U.S. Any of these might, in a
                                rapidly changing situation in Libya, be tempted to improve its
                                position at the expense of the U.S.</item>

                        <p>One of the issues that has been hanging around for a long time may come
                            to a point of decision in the next month. I believe the decision is
                            self-evident, but I do want to acquaint you with the issue.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration
                            and prior to the Libyan coup, the US had entered into a contract selling
                            a small number of F-5 aircraft to Libya. Ten were delivered long ago and
                            eight remain to be delivered under the contract. Delivery of the final
                            eight has been withheld because of the political situation in Libya and
                            the present government's position toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                            Also, the rationale for our involving ourselves with the Libyan air
                            force—our retention of Wheelus airbase ended with our departure from
                            Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>I personally cannot conceive how we could defend sending any combat
                            aircraft to Libya under the present circumstances. Therefore, I see it
                            as a foregone conclusion that we will not go through with this
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>, however, will
                            be back here on consultation next month, attempting to persuade
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to go ahead with
                            the sale. His rationale is that we need to maintain some line to this
                            Libyan government.</p>
                        <p>My answer to that is that this Libyan government is not going to like us
                            no matter what we do.</p>
                        <p>I assume you agree.</p>

                        <p>HAK:<lb/>I sympathize with Hal's view but (1) the F-5's can't do any
                            significant harm in the Arab-Israeli contest, (2) if we don't sell them
                            the French or the Russians will and (3) there may be a way we could use
                            them to loosen up the aid talks (and here we have a real economic
                            interest).</p>
                        <p>Obviously there would be domestic criticism unless a good aid settlement

                                <item>- a substantial increase in the posted price of oil, on which
                                    taxes are based;</item>
                                <item>- that the companies reinvest a portion of their profits in

                                <item>- and a bonus payment to the Mediterranean countries due to
                                    the savings realized by the companies because of the lower
                                    transportation costs for oil from Mediterranean, as opposed to
                                    Persian Gulf, terminals to Europe.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The oil companies are worried that Iraq and Algeria will support the
                            Libyan price demands by participating in an oil embargo, should the
                            companies reject Libya's proposals. They fear also that Libya and
                            Algeria are determined to force a price settlement in the Mediterranean
                            high enough above that recently reached between the companies and
                            Persian Gulf producers in Tehran to cause the Persian Gulf countries to
                            repudiate the Tehran agreement and ask for further increases in payments
                            from the oil companies. (The Shah has said he would not do this but if
                            the Mediterranean settlement is too high, domestic pressures may force
                            him to do so.) The companies are concerned that if the Mediterranean
                            companies do embargo oil the resulting oil shortage would be so
                            intolerable to governments of consuming countries that they would then
                            force the oil companies to accede to Libyan demands.</p>
                        <p>The companies are now considering their next moves. They have been told
                            informally that they must meet Libya's demands by midnight on March 18 —
                            (or else). However, Libya has so far avoided a major confrontation and
                            can continue to do so in the present situation if she so wishes.</p>

                        <p>This Estimate assesses likely developments in Libyan policy, particularly
                            with regard to international relations. Since the Libyan regime is a
                            small and secretive group that appears to have formulated few long-range
                            plans, there are areas of considerable uncertainty, and the judgments
                            are necessarily tentative. Most are intended to apply only to the next
                            year or two, although a few longer term trends also are indicated.</p>

                                    >RCC</gloss>), led by the 28 year-old Colonel <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>, has gained great credit in
                                Libya by forcing the evacuation of Western military bases and by
                                winning huge increases in income from oil. It has done little to
                                improve the lives of Libya's two million people or to provide for
                                broad participation in the running of the country. It is not likely
                                to move much farther in these areas in the months ahead, but since
                                the expectations of the Libyan people are not very high, dissension
                                will probably remain small in scale and geographically fragmented.
                                We believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has
                                sufficient assets—in public acceptance, troops, and money—to

                                steps to increase government control of the oil industry in Libya
                                will continue.</item>

                            <item>In a sharp break with the previous regime's policy, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has turned primarily to Egypt for
                                military training and technical assistance and to France, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Czechoslovakia for arms.
                                Concurrently, it has continued to seek some of the weapons ordered
                                from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US by the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName> regime, though it
                                wants to change some of the orders. The government clearly wants an
                                elaborate military establishment and prefers to avoid dependence on
                                any single source of supply. But Libyan personnel resources are so
                                severely limited that no amount of arms and money will give the
                                Libyan Armed Forces the capacity to pose a measurable military
                                threat to any of its neighbors, much less Israel.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> wants to be important in
                                Arab affairs. It has given a substantial portion of its income to
                                other countries, largely to encourage unity efforts and to promote
                                the anti-Israeli cause. <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName> has apparently been the prime advocate of

                                doubt that it will become a significant supranational organization,
                                but <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> wants to cooperate
                                with Egypt, derives some benefit from doing so, and by dint of the
                                subsidy to Cairo, gains a limited voice on general Arab policy
                                toward Israel. In any case, Libya's sheer financial ability to
                                influence Arab—and even world—affairs will grow rapidly.</item>

                            <item>Libyan relations with the Great Powers are colored by Libya's
                                fervent interest in the Arab-Israeli situation. The <gloss

                                its consistent support for the Arabs. Nevertheless, the <gloss

                                will continue to keep both the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                                expulsion of the US official presence and to a Libyan move against
                                one or more of the oil companies. A settlement, on the other hand,
                                could reduce Libyan involvement in eastern Arab affairs; in time, if

                                itself. There are periodic reports of disgruntlement, plotting, and

                                that they have adequate support within the country to make them a
                                serious threat to the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. The

                                Cyrenaican tribes have been further subjected to government control
                                by the transfer of title to all tribal lands to the state, which <pb

                                Expulsion of the resident Italian community (15,000-20,000 members)

                                most sharply affected were operated largely by and for foreigners.
                                Subsequent government actions have tended to revive sectors of the

                                oil production down from 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 2.9
                                million bpd. In the settlements reached in September 1970, which
                                featured playing off oil companies against one another, the

                                percent. As a result of the 1970 settlements, Libya was assured
                                about $1.4 billion in 1971 for roughly the same amount of oil that

                                oil industry has seen important changes. The 55 percent tax rate
                                rapidly was extended to most Persian Gulf producers, whose posted
                                prices also were increased somewhat. Venezuela unilaterally
                                legislated higher posted prices and an increased tax rate. The
                                Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) met and agreed
                                to cooperate in demands for further increases in prices and other
                                revenue measures. Libya immediately announced demands in addition to
                                those of OPEC—justifying the demands by pointing out Libya's
                                entitlement to retroactive compensation. In an effort to avoid being

                            <item>New talks between the companies and the Libyans began almost
                                immediately after the Teheran agreements. Oil industry
                                representatives, wary of being victimized again by Libyan divisive
                                tactics, mutually supported each other and agreed on common offers.
                                Deadlines were set, approached, and passed. The Libyan negotiators
                                alternately threatened and cajoled. Oil officials from Iraq, Saudi
                                Arabia, and Algeria—all with oil whose value would be affected by
                                the Libyan settlement— announced their support for Libya without
                                committing themselves on the extent of that support. After 6 hectic
                                weeks, an agreement was signed which will net Libya about $2.00 per
                                barrel for oil produced during the remainder of 1971 and as much as
                                $2.30 in 1975. (Under the late 1970 agreement, the Libyans had been
                                getting $1.30 per barrel.) If production runs at the 3.2 million bpd
                                level of early 1971, therefore, Libya will receive total oil
                                revenues of about $24 billion in 1971. The oil industry attained its
                                principal objective—a 5 year agreement generally consistent with the
                                Gulf settlement. Libya, on the basis of geographical advantage and
                                low sulphur oil won a higher permanent differential between the
                                payments for Libyan oil and for Gulf oil and an industry-wide
                                commitment on future exploration activity. For all the histrionics
                                and brinksmanship, the Libyan regime demonstrated a clear
                                understanding of the international oil situation and a willingness
                                to reach a negotiated settlement.</item>

                            <item>This is not to say that relations with the oil companies will be
                                tranquil in the future. The Libyans are determined and cocksure, and
                                they have shown themselves willing to get tough on occasion. They
                                undoubtedly will continue to make the oil companies pay a high and
                                rising price—in terms of revenues, reinvestment, and control of
                                operations—in exchange for the right to operate. They will probably
                                find excuses for reopening negotiations with one or more of the
                                companies well before the expiration of the five year contracts now

                            <item>While negotiating for higher revenues per barrel and imposing
                                production controls, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> also
                                has been pressing for a greater Libyan role in future oil
                                operations. A deep-seated interest in an independent oil production
                                capability no doubt is enhanced by the fact that almost 90 percent
                                of current production is controlled by US-owned companies, who are
                                subject to Libyan antagonism because of US support for Israel.
                                During the 1970 negotiations, one company preferred to relinquish a
                                small field rather than continue operating in accord with Libya's
                                demands; that field is now being operated by the Libyan National Oil
                                Company (<gloss target="#t_LNOC1">LNOC</gloss>). The <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has announced that future
                                concessions will be granted only to joint ventures with <gloss

                                distribution and marketing facilities have been nationalized. The
                                Libyans also have been consulting with the Algerians on methods of
                                dealing with foreign oil companies. This could presage a Libyan
                                move, along the lines developed by Algeria in 1967, to gain a
                                controlling voice in management of one or more of the oil companies
                                and control of their use of funds through administrative fiat rather
                                than legal change in ownership. All of this would serve, among other
                                things, to give Libyans badly needed experience in the operation of
                                the oil industry.</item>

                            <item>The Libyans probably intend to take over the oil industry
                                gradually, rather than by outright nationalization; we believe the
                                latter remains unlikely, at least within the next year or two. Under
                                the latest agreement, Libya can count on revenues of at least $2.3
                                billion annually. Nationalization would entail substantial loss of
                                income, at least for some months, and would require Libya to take
                                investment risks in exploring for new fields and developing new
                                markets. The number of Libyans capable of managing or participating
                                in modern industrial pursuits is extremely limited, and their
                                talents are sorely needed in other sectors of the economy. Our
                                judgment is that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> was not—and

                                that nationalization would entail. Therefore, the US balance of
                                payments will probably continue to benefit from substantial profit
                                remittances from Libya for at another couple of years—especially in

                                aircraft; on occasion, it is used as a dispersal field for Egyptian

                                training Libyan units. There are also a handful of Egyptians in
                                Ukbah Bin Nafi (formerly Wheelus) Air Base, which is used by the
                                Libyan Air Force, assisted by Greek and Pakistani training missions.
                                In 1970, when Egypt was subject to Israel's deep penetration raids,
                                the Egyptian Naval Academy was transferred to Libya, but it was
                                subsequently returned to Egypt.</item>

                                to proceed more or less according to schedule—24 in 1971 (including
                                the 6 already delivered), and a similar number in 1972, even though
                                the Libyans probably will not be able to handle any number of the
                                aircraft operationally within the next year or two. Libya has
                                already paid for 40 planes, and it probably would take an overt

                                Israeli requests for Chieftain tanks if they sell them to Libya,
                                since Jaluud has publicly insisted that all Libyan weapons will be

                                inherent in Libya's oil role and Libya's holdings of sterling, and
                                the rationale underlying the Conservative Government's decision to

                                and further deliveries are almost certain. At present, the Soviets

                                    corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> and company have plunged in.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has been the prime
                                mover in promoting various schemes for Arab unity. He has repeatedly
                                pressed the Egyptians to move forward on plans for unity faster than
                                they like. He has toured Arab capitals, often uninvited and without
                                prior warning of his impending arrival, ruffling tempers along the
                                way. He has loudly and simultaneously condemned King Hussein and
                                extremist Palestinians, to the obvious distress of both. He demanded
                                that all Arab states adhere to the <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName> plan—which boils down to a united Arab
                                nation ready to do battle with Israel. He tried to embarrass all
                                concerned into attending a summit meeting at which a schedule for
                                action would be drawn up. So far, all this effort has had two
                                obvious results: <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has
                                won recognition in other Arab capitals as a factor to be coped with
                                on the Arab scene (albeit as gingerly as possible), and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> seems to have become aware
                                that all the sincere rhetoric in the world will not necessarily
                                inspire the Arabs to united action.</item>

                            <item>The close relationship obtaining between Egypt and Libya is a
                                natural outgrowth of the history of the two countries and the two
                                regimes. For most Libyans, Cairo has long been the intellectual and
                                cultural capital of their world. Although Libyan resentment of
                                foreigners leads to pedodic complaints about the sizable Egyptian
                                presence, there is no evidence that such frictions are growing. For
                                the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> served as inspiration and
                                model before the revolution and as mentor immediately afterward. He
                                seems to have had considerable ability to influence their actions in
                                the months between the revolution and his death. With <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> gone, Egyptian influence on
                                the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably has declined
                                somewhat. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members probably
                                are inclined to see themselves—young and active revolutionaries—in
                                favorable contrast to an aging Egyptian leadership which has lost
                                its revolutionary èlan. Moreover the Libyan <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                    >RCC</gloss> is undoubtedly becoming less willing to seek advice
                                in the light of it successful confrontations with foreign
                                governments and foreign oil companies.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has been liberal with
                                money as well as words. In the 18 months since the revolution, he
                                has promised over $400 million to other Arab countries. He has
                                actually paid over about $250 million under these pledges, as well
                                as about $150 million under commitments made by the Idris
                                government. (See Table.) Cairo has been the major beneficiary;
                                without the $160 million or so received from Tripoli in the last
                                year, it might be suffering serious financial difficulties. Jordan
                                has been less fortunate; during the September 1970 confrontation
                                between Hussein and the fedayeen, Libyan payments of $25 million
                                annually due under the Khartoum agreement of 1961 were suspended,
                                and they have not been resumed.</item>

                            <item>Libya surely will continue to support Egypt financially in the
                                absence of a negotiated settlement with Israel, and the bilateral
                                relationship will remain important to both. Neither can easily
                                afford to antagonize the other seriously—at least in present
                                circumstances; both can gain from the friendship. Because of Cairo's
                                financial dependence, its advice will tend to be muted, while

                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> will probably continue
                                to press for progress toward a federation of Arab nations. Plans for
                                a very loose union of Egypt, Libya, and Syria—with the Sudan free to
                                join at some unspecified date—have been announced. but the timetable
                                for implementation is long and the details of the arrangement are
                                hazy. Evidently the federal government—if and when it comes into
                                being—will act largely as a coordinating body for foreign policy.
                                Initial reports indicate that two of the three heads of state will
                                be entitled to override the third, but powers of enforcement are
                                unspecified and probably will not exist. As a practical matter,
                                therefore, only unanimous decisions are likely to be pursued with
                                any vigor. Given the disparate assets and interests of the member
                                states, unanimity probably will equate with blandness—in deeds,
                                though not in words. All things considered, we doubt that the
                                federation will become much more than a consultative and
                                coordinating organization without substantial supranational
                                characteristics.</item>

                                cooperation in formulating negotiating positions. Algeria provides
                                technical assistance to the <gloss target="#t_LNOC1">LNOC</gloss>,
                                and the Libyans probably will continue to look to Algeria for
                                inspiration in developing an independent oil exploration and
                                production capacity. They also seem inclined, of late, to cultivate
                                the general ethnic and cultural ties they have with Tunisia. But the
                                essential focus of Libyan attention will almost certainly be
                                eastward.</item>

                                forces against Israel. Libya has at most 19,000 military personnel;
                                the bulk are men with less than a year's service and minimal
                                technical competence. In short, Libya will not have the capacity to
                                pose a measurable military threat to any of its neighbors, much less
                                to contribute significantly to Egyptian capabilities against
                                Israel.</item>

                            <item>Libya's financial capability to influence international
                                developments will, however, grow rapidly. Libya can be expected to
                                use its money to try to gain diplomatic support for the Arab cause
                                and to encourage “neutralism” in the East-West confrontation. At the
                                current production rate, annual revenues from oil will total $2.3
                                billion or more in each of the next several years. Libya cannot
                                possibly spend such sums for internal purposes. Imports of civilian
                                goods and services, excluding the oil sector, now run about $700
                                million annually; a 50 percent increase, which would be extremely
                                difficult to absorb in Libya's circumstances, would raise these
                                imports to about $1 billion annually. Defense imports currently are
                                budgeted at abut $140 million a year; Libyan ability to use even
                                that amount is highly questionable. Thus, Libya probably cannot
                                spend much more than $1 billion a year for its own requirements. It
                                will have a minimum of $1.0-$1.5 billion annually in the next
                                several years to give away, put in the bank, or use to strengthen
                                its position in the oil industry (e.g., by buying tankers). Last
                                year it gave away about $260 million. If gifts and loans continue at
                                about that level, Libyan reserves would rise at the rate of $1
                                billion or more annually, perhaps reaching $6 billion in 3 or 4
                                years. Even if foreign gifts and loans are greatly increased or
                                Libya spends heavily for oil-related investments, and only $500
                                million, say, is added to reserves annually, Libya would have $4
                                billion—as much hard currency as is now held by France or
                                Japan—within 5 years.</item>

                                services needed to maintain Libya's small fleet of US-supplied
                                military aircraft can be obtained outside of direct US-Libyan
                                official channels, albeit with some difficulty and added expense.
                                Far more important to the total relationship will be the

                            <item>If relations between Libya and the oil companies should
                                deteriorate to the point of a drastic curtailment or total shutdown
                                of oil production and export by companies now operating in Libya, we
                                believe that Libya could produce and market a substantial amount of
                                oil on its own account. Libya has ample financial reserves to
                                continue imports and other foreign transactions for several years.
                                And it would probably not take long before Libya would find foreign
                                purchasers (e.g., Germany, Italy, France) willing to buy oil
                                directly. Procurement of tanker charters and hiring of technical
                                assistance personnel would pose difficult, but probably not
                                insuperable, problems for the Libyans. Libya's geographical
                                position, the quality of its oil, its massive production, and limits
                                on excess capacity elsewhere are such that attempts by other oil
                                producers to replace Libya in European markets would probably fall
                                short of total success. In these circumstances, however, direct
                                Libyan sales certainty would remain well below current exports for
                                an extended period. If the Suez Canal were open at the time, the
                                problems for the Libyans would be greater.</item>

                                Libya thereby. Some Western governments (e.g., France, Italy, and
                                Germany) might offer to negotiate for direct purchase of oil from
                                Libya. Within the Arab world, there would be pressure for the other
                                oil producers to back Libyan demands, but there are limits on how
                                far they would go—as there were this year. Any Arab producers who
                                attempted to take advantage of the situation at Libya's expense
                                would incur sharp Libyan displeasure.</item>

                            <item>A major outbreak of Arab-Israeli hostilities probably would have
                                similar effects in some respects. It probably would lead the Libyans
                                to expel the US official presence and might lead them to move
                                against one or more of the oil companies, as a means of hurting
                                Israel's principal arms supplier. It could cause a rearrangement of
                                inter-Arab friendships, as Libya would embrace those countries that
                                fought hardest or talked loudest against Israel, while shunning the
                                others.</item>

                            <item>On the other hand, some sort of Arab Israeli settlement would
                                create indecision, confusion, and mental agony in Tripoli. The
                                Egyptians, conscious of their financial needs, would try to satisfy
                                the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, but the kind of Arab
                                concessions to Israel inherent in almost any conceivable settlement
                                would be viewed by the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as a
                                sellout of the Arab cause and the onus of Libyan blame would fall on
                                Cairo. After the initial shock wore off, however, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would probably realize that vocal
                                opposition to a settlement would antagonize Egypt without harming
                                Israel. In the end, Libya would probably come to accept the
                                situation and might reduce its involvement in eastern Arab affairs.
                                In time, if the settlement held, the greatest single impediment to
                                US-Libyan relations would decline in importance.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Following your conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> on the question of the aircraft for Libya, that
                            we have three choices: (1) to delay further, (2) to seek further
                            assurances from the Libyans; and (3) to decide not to deliver the
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> continues to
                            believe that delivery of the aircraft is important to the US-Libyan
                            relationship and that a negative decision may precipitate a substantial
                            set-back to our efforts to improve cooperation. At the same time, he
                            believes strongly that he cannot continue to put the Libyans off as we
                            have for the past year, particularly in light of growing Libyan
                            pressures for a yes or no answer.</p>
                        <p>After further consultations with him, we are inclined to regard the idea
                            of requesting further assurances from the Libyans as inadvisable.
                            Although it is quite possible that the Libyans would be willing
                            privately both to give and to honor such assurances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s statements on the Mirages cast
                            doubt on the regime's willingness publicly and unequivocally to confirm
                            them. To explain to the press or Congress, even on a background basis,
                            the fact that they could not really be moved from Libya efficiently
                            could only breed resentment with the Libyans. There is also the question
                            of whether we would feel the general area situation and state of
                            domestic opinion <pb n="2" xml:id="d75-02" facs="d75-02"/>would warrant
                            a positive decision. In other words, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> would be opposed to requesting
                            the assurances unless we were prepared promptly to deliver the planes
                            provided the assurances were both positive and publicly useable.</p>
                        <p>We therefore believe that we should say no to the Libyans on the
                            remaining eight aircraft, taking advantage of the changed circumstances
                            clause in the original contract. We would express our willingness to
                            provide all necessary help for their utilization of the remaining
                            aircraft, but express the view that it is in our common interest to
                            phase out our military relationship.</p>
                        <p>We anticipate some perhaps strong expressions of unhappiness on the part
                            of the Libyans but do not feel it will result in any break in diplomatic
                            relations. We can probably anticipate that should any difficulties arise
                            on the Mirage arrangements; the Libyans will obtain aircraft from the
                            Soviets, probably using our refusal as an excuse. We should be prepared
                            to explain the rationale of our decision to the Egyptians in Cairo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> dissents from this decision and
                            argues for a postponement of it if a favorable decision to deliver the
                            planes cannot be made. Its argument for a postponement is based on the
                            desirability of us knowing more about the key aspects of the
                            newly-formed Federation of Arab Republics. We share Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>'s view that he must have a
                            decision on this matter by the time he returns to Tripoli at the end of
                            May - which would be at least three months before the September 1
                            plebiscite called to ratify the establishment of the Federation. We
                            therefore regard <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s desire for
                            further delay as impractical, in addition to disagreeing with it on
                            substantive grounds.</p>

                        <p>You may recall that we mentioned to you last fall rumors of a plot by
                            some Libyans to try to free political prisoners in Libya and launch a
                            movement by them against the government. This has been on and off ever
                            since, and Dick Helms in the attached described some of the later
                            episodes. This is just to keep you informed.</p>

                                >CIA</gloss> [text not declassfied] were tipped off that a group of
                            European mercenaries (including British and French nationals) had been
                            recruited to conduct a commando raid against a prison in Tripoli with
                            the objective of freeing some 150 political prisoners, supplying them
                            with arms and turning them loose to form the core of a
                            counter-revolutionary force within Libya. The mercenaries were
                            reportedly to use a ship known as La Caravelle, bearing the Panamanian
                            flag, which was based in Bari, Italy.</p>
                        <p>

                            felt that all evidence pointed to the fact that the plot was unlikely to
                            succeed in overthrowing the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> and
                            that we would be blamed and that would jeopardize the oil negotiations
                            then going on. [text not declassfied] British mercenaries involved in
                            the plot were warned that their cover was blown and were advised to call
                            off the scheme. The upshot was that the mercenary leadership agreed to
                            do so, but not without passing a warning through its contacts that
                            another attempt would probably be made in the near future.</p>

                            may himself be calling the operation off since, despite his sizeable
                            investments in crews and ships, the plot has repeatedly failed.</p>

                                Israel by the Arab nations and promised Libyan financial support for
                                this action. In September 1970, Libya broke diplomatic relations
                                with the Kingdom of Jordan during that government's struggle with
                                the Fedayeen, and abrogated the Khartoum agreement to make regular
                                financial payments to Jordan. Early in November 1970, plans for the

                                on 18 July 1970 gave substance to the fears of many Western
                                observers that it was only a matter of time before the Soviet Union
                                would be able to exploit its Middle Eastern foreign policy
                                objectives, which appeared to be closely aligned with those of the
                                post-revolutionary Libyan leadership, and to utilize these common
                                interests to increase Soviet influence in Libya. In the wake of
                                further breakdowns in arms discussions between Libyan and British
                                leaders, problems with the French over the Mirage contracts, and the

                            <item>By September 1970, Libyan officials had successfully negotiated
                                settlements with all the major foreign oil producers in the country.
                                The agreement increased Libyan oil revenues approximately 20 percent
                                over the annual 1.2 billion dollars. The agreement also served as a
                                catalyst for new demands by the entire OPEC community. The
                                mid-February agreement between OPEC and the Persian Gulf producing
                                oil companies served as a foundation for additional Libyan demands

                                Jordan during the latter's struggle with the Fedayeen and supported

                        <p>In approving this paper, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> has stressed the importance of viewing U.S.
                            policy towards Libya not just in bilateral terms, but also in the wider
                            context of other significant U.S. interests and policies in the area
                            which condition all our relations with Libya. These include: (1) the
                            dependence of Europe on Libyan oil production and on U.S. oil companies
                            as suppliers, set against the unpredictable character, relatively
                            unrestrained freedom of action and aggressive oil policies of the
                            present Libyan regime; (2) the increased Soviet presence in the
                            Mediterranean combined with the reduction of Western (U.S., <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Italian influence in Libya since the
                            1969 coup; (3) the U.S. commitment to a peaceful solution of the
                            Arab-Israel conflict and to the security of Israel, set against Libya's
                            militant Arab nationalist posture; and (4) the fluid inter-Arab
                            political situation, including the evolving nature of the Arab
                            Federation.</p>
                        <p>In examining these considerations, it should be born in mind that we are
                            dealing with a primitive, largely illiterate people of under two
                            million, living in a country with presumed limited (apart from oil)
                            natural resources, and led by relatively inexperienced and unpredictable
                            men. Libya's income from oil revenues will soon be $2 billion a year,
                            and her foreign exchange reserves may, in five years, equal those of
                            Italy. How this enormous wealth will be used, and what will happen
                            politically and economically as a result, remains very much to be seen.
                            The American oil companies have retained their predominant position in
                            Libya, and the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> appears to be
                            inclined to turn to the U.S. for its technological needs. 450 Libyan
                            students are in the United States, and some movement of non-petroleum
                            oriented technology and capital towards Libya is discernible.</p>
                        <p>We are deliberately keeping a low official profile in Libya, and the next
                            months and probably years will be the ones of watchful waiting and
                            patient efforts to help keep the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>
                            on a moderate and sensible track. It follows that some of the listed

                            <lb/>Secretary of State<lb/>Department of State<lb/>Washington, D. C.
                            20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>As you know, our Ambassador to Libya has asked for guidance in explaining
                            the absence of a U.S. decision on Libya's requests for major military
                            equipment (F-5s, C-130s and 175mm artillery). Concurrently, the Spanish
                            Ambassador has asked Alex Johnson for a U.S. position on an export
                            license for five F-5s from the Spanish plant (CASA) for delivery to
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me the Spanish request might offer some promise for partially
                            resolving our dilemma. We could instruct Joe Palmer to tell the Libyans
                            quite frankly that (i) our decision on their requests is tied to our
                            overall arms policy to the Mid-East; (ii) in view of the present
                            situation, we wish to limit arms deliveries to all countries in the
                            area, and we cannot, consequently, give an answer to their requests at
                            this time; (iii) in deference to our relations with Libya we are
                            prepared to approve a Spanish request for an F-5 export license for a
                            limited number (up to eight) of F-5Bs (the trainer version); and, in the
                            meantime, we will continue to review Libya's other requests against
                            developments in the area.</p>
                        <p>While this may not be completely satisfactory to the Libyans, it would
                            demonstrate some forthcomingness on our part. This would also allow us
                            to release the aircraft we have had earmarked for the Libyans and avoid
                            further storage costs. There is, of course, always the risk of some
                            unfavorable publicity, particularly since the F-5Bs might be linked to
                            training Libyans to fly the Mirages being delivered from France. I would
                            think, however, that the non-combatant nature of the aircraft and the
                            indirect role of the U.S. would tend to mitigate such criticism.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that this is not an easy decision. I believe, however, that
                            the course I have proposed would be least disruptive to our Mid-East
                            posture while at the same time offering some promise of maintaining our
                            considerable interests in Libya. I continue to believe those interests
                            will be best served by avoiding the appearance of closing the door
                            completely on their requests.</p>

                        <p>The Libyan Radio and Libyan News Agency announced December 7 the
                            nationalization of British Petroleum's subsidiary in Libya, <gloss

                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> may have been nationalized because of
                            Libya's intense dissatisfaction with what it believes is the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> role in the Iranian seizure of the
                            Persian Gulf islands. The seizure may also have reflected <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> frustration over its inability to
                            resolve a long-outstanding financial dispute with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> centering around the aborted sale of a
                            missile defense system by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to the
                            former regime for which the monarchy had made a substantial down
                            payment.</p>
                        <p>In seizing <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> Libya, the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> hits the British government as well
                            as the company, since <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> owns nearly 50
                            percent of the parent company. Libya announced a new company will be
                            formed, the Arabian Gulf Prospecting Company, to take over <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'S assets.</p>
                        <p>With production in Libya of 200,000 barrels per day, <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> is one of the largest oil producing and
                            exporting companies there. Its importance to us is that it operates in
                            equal partnership with Nelson Bunker Hunt of Texas. There was no
                            indication Libya intends to take over Bunker Hunt or to nationalize
                            other companies. However, <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> was the
                            operator of the joint <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>-Bunker Hunt
                            concession. If <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> withdraws its
                            personnel, there may be temporary difficulties in finding technicians to
                            carry out oil operations in that concession area. The Libyan action will
                            also throw a fright into the other oil companies, chiefly American,
                            regarding their future.</p>

                        <p>The British Embassy in Tripoli expressed fears December 4 that Libya
                            might take some drastic move against British interest, including a break
                            in diplomatic relations. As yet, there is no indication either side
                            intends to break relations. However, earlier unconfirmed reports
                            indicated Libya was transferring funds out of London. Its total funds
                            there probably amount to over $2 billion. If confirmed, this transfer
                            obviously might pose major financial problems, at least temporarily, for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your letter of December 2, 1971 recommending that we permit
                            the Spanish firm (CASA) to sell five F-5's to Libya.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the need of maintaining our considerable interests in Libya.
                            For that reason I have declined to shut the door completely on sales of
                            major military equipment to Libya. However, I also do not believe it
                            possible at this time to permit the Spanish to transfer F-5's to the
                            Libyans for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>Political reasons predominate. There have been no signs of any Libyan
                            moderation in Middle Eastern affairs. On the contrary, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> still espouses armed conflict as
                            the only means of settling Arab-Israeli problems; his behavior still
                            remains erratic as shown by the December 7 nationalization of <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> Petroleum; Libyan funds support the
                            Fedayeen and there are now confirmed reports of the arrival in Syria of
                            Libyan commandos to support the Fedayeen; only a few months ago the
                            Libyans supported the coup in Morocco and still are causing difficulties
                            for the Government of Chad and Eritrea. The F-5's, whether from the US
                            or Spain, will be clearly identified as American aircraft and will be so
                            regarded by Libya's neighbors, including Arab governments friendly
                            toward the United States. I believe the political sensitivity of this
                            sale is not diminished by the fact that deliveries would be of <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d81-02" facs="d81-02"/>the F-5B trainer version, especially
                            since the Libyans have told us they want these aircraft to train pilots
                            to fly Mirage jets from France. All interested parties would know that
                            US Government approval is required for sale of the F-5s from Spain to
                            Libya. I do not believe we can or should appear to be enhancing Libyan
                            combat capability by facilitating the Libyan transition to Mirages.</p>

                        <p>There are legal aspects as well. In January, Congress passed an amendment
                            to the Foreign Military Sales Act (Section 9) providing that consent to
                            a third country transfer of defense articles should not be given unless
                            the U.S. itself would transfer the defense article under consideration
                            to that country. For policy reasons, we are not prepared to permit
                            Northrop to provide F-5's to Libya at this time. Thus we are constrained
                            under Section 9 from allowing the Spanish firm to do so.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the problems for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> in continuing to tell the Libyans that this sale
                            remains under review. However, having carefully considered the
                            alternatives, including your suggestion, I believe we should continue to
                            hold to the line. We will review this position, of course, should any
                            major developments in the area or in our bilateral relations with Libya
                            justify doing so.</p>
                        <p>I regret that I could not be more forthcoming to your recommendation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On December 7, the Libyan Government nationalized <gloss target="#t_BP1"
                                >BP</gloss>'s Libyan subsidiary, but the decree did not include
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s 50 percent American partner,
                            Bunker Hunt. Bunker Hunt is trying to cooperate with the Libyans to the
                            extent of keeping production going but has refused a Libyan request that
                            it market the ex-<gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> share of the oil as
                            well as its own. The Department has agreed to support the request of the
                            American oil companies operating in Libya for a business review letter
                            from the Department of Justice that will allow them to act in concert in
                            support of <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>, which intends to take
                            legal action against any purchasers of oil from its concession.</p>
                        <p>On December 10, the British Government requested US support for its
                            demarches to major oil consuming countries, and for a press statement by
                            us deploring the use of nationalization as a political weapon. The
                            request for a press statement was subsequently withdrawn. The British
                            intend to request governments of consuming countries not to purchase oil
                            from the nationalized concession and further to use their influence to
                            dissuade their oil companies from purchasing such oil.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Discussion:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Several considerations weighed against our supporting the British
                            demarches. The Libyan action against <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>
                            occurred at a time of rising Libyan frustration over long unsettled
                            claims against the British (former British base rights, a cancelled air
                            defense system contract, non-delivery of Chieftain tanks) which were
                            purely bilateral in nature and had nothing to do with the United States.
                            It carefully avoided action against any US companies in Libya, including
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s American partner. Any US
                            Government action in support of <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> or the
                            British which became known to the volatile and unpredictable Libyan
                            Government could precipitate Libyan retaliation against American
                            interests in Libya. Moreover, the American oil companies had not asked
                            us to take any action with regard to the nationalization beyond
                            supporting their request for a business review letter. The British, with
                            no substantial interests left in Libya, would have little to lose in
                            fighting the nationalization to the end; the United States would be
                            risking a great deal in supporting such an all-or-nothing policy. It was
                            also argued that our support for the British demarche would have very
                            little if any real effect on consuming governments. Nor would any
                            British or combined British-US action to foreclose the market ever
                            induce the nationalistic Libyans to reverse their nationalization and
                            return the concession to <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the Libyans followed up their nationalization of
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> with successful marketing of the
                            oil to <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> members, it would
                            inevitably weaken our own interests in Libya as well as other oil
                            producing states. Failure by the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>,
                            and particularly the US, to support the British in this instance would
                            compromise, perhaps fatally, the common front through which the
                            consuming countries and the oil companies hope to blunt the OPEC drive
                            for higher oil prices and eventual control of the companies. To the
                            degree that the Libyans nationalization could be made difficult, it
                            would serve to inhibit further such actions. By supporting the British
                            and maintaining some measure of consumer state solidarity, we would in
                            effect be supporting our own interests through the oil companies' joint
                            front tactics vis-à-vis OPEC.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On balance, the long range consequences of not supporting the British
                            seemed likely to be more serious than the immediate risk of provoking
                            Libyan Government action against our interests there. Moreover, the
                            Senior Review Group discussions on expropriation consistently favored
                            steps to organize consumer state solidarity in resistance to
                            nationalizations. Our maintenance of a common front now on Britain's
                            behalf should also be useful to us in other future contexts, such as the
                            Chilean nationalizations.</p>
                        <p>We have accordingly agreed to instruct our embassies in <gloss

                            governments to use their influence with their national oil companies and
                            refineries not to accept <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s

                            <lb/>Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs<lb/>Washington,
                            D.C.</p>
                        <p>Dear <persName>David</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I followed with great interest your recent trip and gather it was most
                            successful. Numeiri's backtracking was disappointing, although he seems
                            clearly to be moving in the right direction and the amount of time he
                            devoted to you was most impressive.</p>
                        <p>During your absence, our military supply problems have continued to
                            plague us. I had hoped to catch you in Europe on your way home to
                            discuss my concerns, but the telegram I sent to Khartoum suggesting this
                            missed you and I learned from Curt Moore that you would not be pausing
                            long in London.</p>
                        <p>I am therefore taking this means of letting you know of my
                            continuing—even increasing—concern with the accumulation of military
                            supply problems we are facing. To make things easier for you, I am
                            attaching the references.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">1. F-5's</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I know—and accept—that the “no decision” is the Secretary's decision.
                            What I have difficulty in understanding, however, is why, when I propose
                            a reply to YUNIS which is entirely consistent with the Secretary's line
                            with only slight non-substantive embroideries, I get no answer at all
                            from the Department. (See Tripoli 2167—para 2—TAB A)</p>
                        <p>Nor do I understand why, when I ask for some Washington approved language
                            to explain our “no decision”, I again meet with the same silence. As you
                            well know, Libyans, like <pb n="2" xml:id="d83-02" facs="d83-02"
                            />everyone else, ask questions. I just cannot continue to face them,
                            smile in a friendly manner, and say in effect that Washington has made
                            no decision but that I (1) don't know; (2) can't say; 3) won't tell; (4)
                            am too embarrassed to discuss/choose one/why!</p>
                        <p>I note that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> in his
                            memorandum of December 2 (TAB C) to the Secretary suggests that we
                            explain our problem on the basis of our wish to limit arms deliveries to
                            all countries in the area in the light of the general situation. I
                            believe that this would be particularly dangerous: (a) Are we actually
                            going to deliver the F-5's to Libya if we decide on further Phantom
                            deliveries to Israel? (b) Are we going to deliver the F-5's if there
                            should be some improvement in the area situation? I doubt that the
                            answer would be affirmative on either score. Similarly, it has been
                            informally suggested at various times in the past that the rationale
                            might be tied to the incompatibility of various Libyan actions with US
                            interests in the area. I think this would be even more dangerous and apt
                            to provoke an even worse confrontation than a flat turn down.</p>
                        <p>The fact of the matter is the Department has left me for about 18 months
                            now with no credible and presentable explanation for our failure,
                            inability or unwillingness to take a decision. Perhaps the problem is
                            that those responsible for answering our telegrams cannot come up with a
                            satisfactory rationale either. I am frank to say that I can't, but it
                            might help clear the air between Tripoli and the Department if we were
                            told frankly that Washington can't either.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, because of the Department's failure to address specifically
                            either of the two matters on which I requested guidance in paras. 2 and
                            3 of Tripoli 2167 (TAB A), I have lost the initiative with YUNIS and I
                            am vulnerable once again to further importunings by him or by other
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members pressing for some sort
                            of a response, and I shall have to go all through the sorry charade
                            again. I could understand the deafening silence if I had been pressing
                            for a reconsideration of the “no decision” policy, But I was not
                            pressing for such a reply. I was merely asking for an updated
                            reiteration of “no decision” tailored to a particular approach, and for
                            some additional guidance to explain the “no decision”. A month later I
                            have received nothing other than the pear-shaped second paragraph of
                            State 220238 (TAB B) which could equally as well have come by sea pouch
                            as by Immediate telegram.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d83-03" facs="d83-03"/>
                        <p>Incidentally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>'s
                            suggestion for licensing the F-5's from Spanish production (see Jim
                            Blake's letter of December 6—TAB C) seems on the surface to offer a
                            possibly attractive way out of our commitment. At the same time, the
                            planes would presumably have to be built from scratch with a
                            considerable delay in delivery time compared with the US model which the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> assumes are in storage and
                            ready for delivery anytime the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            prepared to release them. Since the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss>'s principal desire is to get the planes quickly for
                            transition training to the Mirages, they are unlikely to be mollified by
                            this offer. Moreover, from a Washington point of view, I remain dubious
                            about circuitous ploys of this kind. If we are concerned about
                            Congressional and public reaction to US F-5 deliveries to Libya, we
                            certainly run the risk of being pilloried even more by resorting to what
                            many would regard as a subterfuge in making the planes available through
                            the less than popular Spanish! We tried this with Pakistan via Turkey
                            several years ago and got clobbered!</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="underline">2. C-130's</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Enough on F-5's. Turning to the C-130's, let me first make clear my
                            concern that our Lockheed friends are playing fast and loose with us. At
                            least informally for the record, I would like to make several comments
                            on Cowden's letter of December 1 to you (TAB D). In the first place, I
                            have not seen or heard any sort of a satisfactory explanation from
                            Lockheed as to how the quantum jump from 4 to 8 aircraft took place, and
                            I cannot escape the suspicion that Lockheed itself may have encouraged
                            this increase in the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> request to
                            help solve the problem of its Marietta production line. Is there any
                            reason why the Department should not press Lockheed for an explanation
                            of this rather important new dimension of the problem? Secondly, I find
                            it strange that Cowden never mentioned to me that Farjani had told him
                            that failure to license the additional C-130's could result in a break
                            in diplomatic relations with the US. (All Cowden told me was that
                            Farjani had said that such failure could result in expulsion of the
                            Lockheed team, the “burning” of the present 8 planes, and the
                            acquisition of Soviet transport aircraft.) Again, I suspect that the
                            “break in relations” bit has been added after the fact in an effort to
                            influence the Department. Thirdly, I never told Cowden that I “did not
                            anticipate any problem in regard to Lockheed's air drop equipment and
                            training <pb n="4" xml:id="d83-04" facs="d83-04"/>program.” I did tell
                            him before he saw Farjani that I had recommended a favorable Department
                            response to the licensing application for the air drop equipment, adding
                            that I could not however say what the ultimate decision would be.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I was not in favor at the outset of permitting Lockheed to
                            proceed with discussions with the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss> for additional C-130's. I was wrong in permitting
                            myself to be persuaded at that time that Lockheed explorations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>, without commitment, would not
                            do any harm. It has done harm and added another horn to our present
                            dilemma. Nevertheless we started down the road and, if our objective is
                            to avoid confrontation, it seems to me that the present logic of the
                            situation is to permit Lockheed to go ahead with their contract and to
                            face up to the licensing problem in 1973. Meanwhile, like the baseball
                            team whose pitcher hasn't shown up, we can always pray for rain!</p>
                        <p>However, I agree with Jim Blake that we should not let Lockheed maneuver
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> into turning a blind eye on,
                            thereby tacitly approving, a type of contract that is misleading and
                            that will therefore give us even greater trouble with both the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> and Lockheed. I refer particularly to
                            paragraphs 2 c and d of Mr. <persName>Cowden</persName>'s letter to Jim
                            of December 3 (TAB E). Taken together they will lead, almost certainly,
                            to a situation where the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has a
                            claim against Lockheed for return of advance payments—due to the export
                            licenses not being forthcoming from the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>. Again, we will be in the middle, where Lockheed wants
                            us.</p>

                            This decision has already badly undermined the credibility of our “no
                            decision” on the F-5's and C-130's. (who will believe we will license 8
                            additional military C-130's if we won't license air drop equipment?)
                            Although I continue to believe we should have approved the request, it
                            seems to me that at the minimum we should have placed the item in limbo
                            with the F-5's and C-130's.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I would like to raise once again the question of the Sikorsky
                            helicopters which was the subject of our 2228 (TAB F), The only reaction
                            we have had to this message has been <persName corresp="#p_CWJ1">Warren
                                Clark</persName>'s short note of December 7 to Charles Marthinsen
                            (TAB G) saying that there has been “no approval by Sikorsky for the sale
                            of helicopters to the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>”, but that
                            “We would certainly want to look very closely at any such request,” I do
                            not know what “no approval by Sikorsky” means, but assume that “no
                            application by Sikorsky” was intended. In any event, the intent of our
                            telegram was to suggest that somebody contact Sikorsky, find out what
                            they have in mind, tell them right from the beginning that they haven't
                            got a Chinaman's chance of getting the necessary licenses, and urge them
                            to lay off. In short, we should do now with Sikorsky what I wish we had
                            done from the beginning with Lockheed. At least with Sikorsky there has
                            not been, as far as I know, any approach to the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> so we do have a chance to avoid the problem.</p>
                        <p>I regret the complaining tone which the foregoing recital of problems
                            conveys, I know the clearance problem on formal communications on such
                            sensitive and complicated problems, but informal channels are open to at

                        <p>January 7, 1972</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Joe:</p>
                        <p>Your letter of December 22 rings very sincerely with the frustration I am
                            sure you are encountering in the absence of decisions or further
                            instructions on the questions of military supplies to Libya.</p>
                        <p>As disappointing as it may be, I feel I have no alternative but to say
                            that I see little likelihood of change. Having been at least four times
                            up to the Secretary on this matter, Alex Johnson and I do not feel we
                            are in a position to go again in the absence of some genuine change in
                            the circumstances surrounding the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary's reasoning is thus: The absence of a decision, while it
                            has undoubtedly been difficult to live with in Tripoli, has not brought
                            any marked reaction from the Libyans. No one is able to make a
                            convincing case to him that the absence of a decision increases the risk
                            of an adverse Libyan reaction. This feeling is accentuated by the
                            impression that, if the Libyans for their own reason desire to move
                            against the interests of the United States, they will find reasons to do
                            so, no matter what we do. All of this is accompanied by a feeling that
                            any initiative, such as one with Colonel YUNIS, would not be helpful and
                            only tend further to aggravate the situation. The Secretary feels that a
                            negative decision could on the other hand provoke a reaction which the
                            absence of a decision will not.</p>
                        <p>The Honorable<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Joseph Palmer</persName> 2nd,<lb/>American
                            Ambassador,<lb/>Tripoli, Libya,</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d84-02" facs="d84-02"/>
                        <p>While, therefore, not wanting to make a negative decision, neither does
                            he feel he can make a positive decision, givan various Libyan third
                            country adventures, without running into serious public relations and
                            Congressional problems here. NEA is convinced the Israelis would make a
                            major issue of even symbolic shipments because of the active Libyan
                            support for Palestinian extremism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary feels that his instructions are clear and, for this reason
                            has not been interested in further communications or instructions on the
                            problem. We were, perhaps, remiss in not replying to 2167, but, as you
                            can see, there was little more that could be said. There the matter
                            stands. He knows that there are risks in this policy given <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s erratic character, and he
                            knows very well of your concerns. In the absence of some major new
                            development, however, or of some compelling argument for being more
                            precise, he simply will not change his view that our best position is
                            the one he has repeatedly adopted.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as the C-130s are concerned, you should by now have received the
                            report of my conversation with Messars. Cowden and Monro of Lockheed. I
                            believe they have no doubt regarding the Department's attitude toward a
                            contract with the Libyans which the company almost certainly could not
                            execute. Mr. <persName>Cowden</persName>, as a good salesman and
                            representative of his company, is determined to get this sale because of
                            the real threat to the existence of the Lockheed-Georgia plant unless
                            its production line can be assured. He has promised, however, to convey
                            the Department's views to the company's management and to let us know
                            what its decision will be. If the decision is to go ahead with the
                            contract, then we will seek the intervention of higher levels of the
                            Department with Lockheed's top management.</p>

                        <p>You asked about air drop equipment. Our refusal to license it for export
                            to Libya has nothing to do with the proposed additional eight C-130s for
                            the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> since the equipment could be
                            used on the C-130s that <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> now
                            possesses. I see no reason why the Libyans should conclude that the sale
                            of the original C-130s implied a willingness on our part to sell
                            everything else that could augment the capability of the planes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWJ1">Warren Clark</persName> received a
                            representative of United Aircraft on January 4 in connection with the
                            company's interest in selling helicopters to Libya. By now you should
                            have our cable on that subject as well as that reporting my conversation
                            with the Lockheed representatives. While I understand your desire that
                            we tell United Aircraft or others that we are opposed to the sale to
                            Libya of helicopters having a major military role, I am satisfied that
                                <persName>Warren</persName>'s exposition to the United Aircraft
                            representative satisfactorily reflected for the time being our position
                            regarding the sales in question.</p>
                        <p>I know how it is to receive a letter like this, but I have no choice. If
                            you have further arguments either for some new initiative or for a new
                            policy let us have them. Meanwhile, we here see little way out of the
                            impasse.</p>

                            interest to the Nation of Islam (NOI), more commonly known as the Black
                            Muslims.</p>
                        <p>NOI is a radical black organization which advocates the establishment of
                            an independent black nation in the United States, preaches hatred of the
                            white man while teaching strong puritanical self-disciple for its black
                            followers, and purports to follow the Moslem religion. Founded in the
                            1930's by Elijah Muhammad, the self-styled “Messenger of Allah,” NOI has
                            established temples throughout the country and a lavish headquarters in
                            Chicago. Its most prominent follower, until a split led to his
                            assassination, was Malcolm X. More recently, younger dissident elements
                            have started open warfare with the NOI leadership and sparked violent
                            confrontations such as the recent incident in Baton Rouge, La. which
                            resulted in four deaths.</p>
                        <p>In mid-December Herbert Muhammad, the son of Elijah Muhammad, met in
                            Tripoli with Libyan Prime Minister Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM1"
                                >Mu'ammar Qadhafi</persName> to request aid. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> agreed to lend NOI one
                            million Libyan pounds (about three million dollars) without interest on
                            the assumption that the money would be used to establish church
                            facilities for teaching the Arabic language and the Islamic religion.
                            The loan was to be consummated through the Libyan Ambassador to the
                            United States, Abdullah Suisi.</p>
                        <p>Investigations by Ambassador Suisi and Minister of Religious Affairs
                            Bashir Al Saghir Al Hawadi have convinced them that NOI is not a Moslem
                            organization in the true sense of the word and that any financial
                            assistance received by them would go toward the personal betterment of
                            Black Muslim leaders. Both Suisi and Hawadi have recently attempted to
                            persuade Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            that no loan should be made. As of January 25, the Ambassador had not
                            yet released the funds to NOI.</p>

                        <p>By an exchange of notes in Tripoli February 5, we have terminated nine
                            bilateral agreements with Libya, including the military base agreement
                            of 1955. Most of these agreements were related to our presence at
                            Wheelus Air Force Base and had no longer served any useful purpose
                            following evacuation of the base in June 1970. Included in the exchange
                            of notes was an agreement we had sought to a mutual washout of financial
                            claims arising from the agreements.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Libyan Government, we have also agreed to withdraw
                            the Military Liaison Staff (<gloss target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss>) from
                            our Embassy in Tripoli by March 15. The mission of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss> was to assist the Libyan armed forces
                            in procurement of military supplies, which has recently covered items
                            such as spare parts for existing equipment purchased from the US prior
                            to the coup in 1969. The request for withdrawal of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss> may be connected with our reluctance to
                            approve exports of major military equipment to Libya such as F-5s and
                            C-130s. Libya also recently requested withdrawal of British military and
                            naval missions.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<lb/>WASHINGTON<lb/>1 MAR 1972</p>
                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>
                            <lb/>Secretary of State<lb/>Department of Stat<lb/>Washington, D. C.
                            20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>The imminent termination of the F-5A production line reduces and
                            complicates the possible options open to us in handling the Libyan F-5
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Since June 1971, when we released the six F-5As from storage, we have
                            relied on earmarking aircraft from future production for Libya in order
                            to avoid storage costs. The last aircraft from the production line,
                            earmarked for Libya, will be completed at the end of March. One <gloss
                                target="#t_RF1">RF</gloss>-5 is currently in storage, and one F-5B
                            is on 30-day recall.</p>
                        <p>We must now consider whether we want to continue to defer a decision on
                            delivery and place the aircraft in storage, or choose from the other
                            options that have been proposed in the past, e.g., agree to deliver
                            eight F-5Bs (trainers) or agree to a delivery from the Spanish
                            facility.</p>
                        <p>Storage costs (about $1850 for each aircraft a month) will become
                            increasingly difficult to fund and, while adding to unit costs, diminish
                            the possibility of selling them to other recipients. Consequently, we
                            need to resolve this matter at an early date and, in any event, before
                            the end of March.</p>
                        <p>The legal restriction raised in your letter of 15 December—that we are
                            constrained by Section 9 of the Foreign Military Sales Act from agreeing
                            to third-country transfers of equipment that the U.S. itself is not
                            willing to transfer—only applies to equipment sold under <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> or provided under grant <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. I understand that the U.S. Air Force
                            has determined that the Spanish F-5 facility is supported entirely from
                            commercial sources. Consequently, the constraints under Section 9 would
                            not arise.</p>
                        <p>I believe our considerable interest in Libya can best be promoted by
                            offering to deliver the trainer version, preferably from the U.S. but
                            alternatively from Spanish production (similar to the proposed Italian
                            M-113 sale). Despite the nil practical effect of such deliveries on the
                            Mid-East arms balance, I recognize the potential for a publicity effort
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d87-02" facs="d87-02"/>to argue the contrary.
                            Juxtaposed against our recent substantial and highly publicized aircraft
                            sales to Israel, I can only conclude that an effort to ballyhoo the sale
                            of eight trainers would fall flat. A decision to provide F-5Bs
                            ourselves, however, would have to be made before April 1, in order to
                            avoid a significant break in the production line and the associated much
                            higher costs.</p>

                        <p>Now that you have decided to hold in abeyance the sale of F-5 aircraft to
                            Libya, replies can be made to letters from Mr. <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> recommended sale of the
                            F-5B either from US or Spanish production. He also asked you to resolve
                            the problem raised by storage costs for the aircraft. We propose that
                            you inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> that: (a)
                            the sale of F-5s to Libya is being held in abeyance; (b) if our policy
                            changes in the future we plan to offer F-5B trainers and (c) we
                            therefore agree to the sale to other countries of the F-5As presently in
                            storage but we wish to keep available for delivery to Libya the one
                            F-5B.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Foreign Minister requested US approval to sell Spanish
                            assembled F-5Bs to Libya. The proposed reply informs him that you desire
                            to hold in abeyance for now a decision on delivery of F-5s to Libya from
                            the US and that we thus cannot agree at this time to the sale from
                            Spanish production.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Libyan Ministry of Unity and Foreign Affairs told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> May 30 that the
                            Libyan Government considers it necessary to limit the US Mission to
                            seven diplomatic and seven administrative American members in Tripoli
                            and Benghazi. There are now 35 Americans at the two posts in Libya.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> was told there
                            were no political reasons for the reduction. The Note from the Ministry
                            said the reductions were because of the prevailing conditions in the two
                            countries; the imbalance of the number of members of the Libyan mission
                            in the US and the US mission in Libya; and the lack of resources
                            (including human resources) at the Ministry of Unity and Foreign Affairs
                            which makes it impossible to undertake the necessary coordination.</p>
                        <p>We are not sure what connection there may be between this and the recent
                            reductions in the US Interests Section in Cairo. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Mission was reduced to the same number of
                            positions. We understand the French and Soviet Embassies may also be
                            reduced. It may be that the Libyans view this reduction as some sort of
                            first step towards their cherished goal of consolidating the Foreign
                            Ministries and foreign policies of the three members of the
                            Confederation of Arab Republics.</p>
                        <p>We are awaiting recommendations from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> before taking further action.

                            that each of the three options presents risks, tends toward option two.
                            He would recommend that we try clearly to separate the oil question from
                            the arms question and talk to the companies about an approach to the
                            Libyans which would emphasize the need to avoid abrupt and hostile
                            action against the companies when they may be moving toward
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>I tend to favor fulfilling our contract on the F-5 aircraft without
                            seeking a specific quid pro quo on the oil company matter. This would
                            remove an obvious irritant in our relations with Libya and might clear
                            the way for less hostile discussions of our overall relations in the
                            future. The rationale of proposing to begin the delivery of the aircraft
                            could be the changed situation in the area, as well as our desire to
                            improve relations with Libya.</p>

                        <p>We have several indications suggesting that Libya may be seriously
                            contemplating the partial (51%) or complete nationalization of one or
                            more of the 13 U.S. companies which currently account for 90% of Libya's
                            production.</p>
                        <p>Senior executives of the companies were summoned to Libya June 9 and were
                            urged by Major JALLUD, currently the Libyan Prime Minister, to urge the
                            U.S. Government to change its policy in the Middle East and its policy
                            on arms supply to Libya. A threat to move against the companies was
                            implied.</p>
                        <p>Major al-Huni, another high ranking member of the regime, coupled the
                            arms supply question with our Middle East policy in telling Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> on July 10 why he
                            saw little prospect for cooperation between the United States and
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence reports indicate that Libya may be preparing to nationalize
                            some or all of the companies on or about September 1, the third
                            anniversary of the military coup. Although such reports have been
                            current in the past, these appear to have more substance to them. Libyan
                            nationalization of the industry would be consistent with what we know of
                            the aim of the Libyans to control their oil, the intense Libyan
                            dissatisfaction with our policy in the Middle East and Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s desire to use oil as a
                            political weapon against the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d90-03" facs="d90-03"/>
                        <p>The Libyan regime also resents our refusal to supply it with certain
                            fighter aircraft which were contracted for by the former government and
                            for other military equipment (C-130's, howitzers, and possibly
                            Sidewinders) which were not contracted for but which they have requested
                            over the past two years. Particularly at issue are eight F-5 aircraft
                            sold to the old regime in 1969 before the coup but not yet delivered and
                            eight additional C-130's offered to them by Lockheed. We have been
                            unwilling to give assurances that we would issue export licenses for
                            these aircraft in 1973. The fact that we have continued to license spare
                            parts for the F-5's and other military equipment we sold to them and
                            that we have authorized the Italians to sell Libya armored personnel
                            carriers, howitzers, recoilless rifles and ammunition which we control
                            through production licenses has not lessened the Libyan Government's
                            resentment against our restrictive arms policy.</p>
                        <p>Nationalization of the Libyan oil industry would be a severe blow to
                            American interests. The industry represents a billion dollars (book
                            value) of U.S. private investment, although some of it (Esso) has
                            apparently already been largely written off. The industry returns as
                            much as $400 million annually to our balance of payments. It produces
                            about two million barrels of oil a day, chiefly for Western European
                            markets, which would be irreplaceable. Loss of the oil, coupled with the
                            shutdown of the Iraq Petroleum Company, would almost certainly force
                            European consumers to come to terms with both Iraq and Libya, possibly
                            bypassing the U.S. companies and discounting any U.S. official
                            opposition. The position of those in the Arab world and elsewhere who
                            wish to nationalize American assets would be strengthened. The move
                            toward nationalization has already gained momentum in the Persian Gulf
                            area and elsewhere in OPEC.</p>

                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> has
                            recently discussed the Libyan situation twice with oil company
                            executives at the senior vice-presidential level, reviewing for them
                            what we might do to head off nationalization. The executives expressed
                            the hope that the U.S. might find some symbolic gesture it would make,
                            at least to buy time.</p>
                        <p>We believe we have three options: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>We could offer to deliver the eight F-5's for which we signed
                                        a contract in 1969 (in the trainer version now desired by
                                        Libya). As a symbolic gesture we might offer to deliver two
                                        planes by the end of the year and the rest within a year.
                                        The purpose of this action would be two-fold: to buy time
                                        during which perhaps the Libyans would not take any
                                        precipitate action against our companies, and to buy enough
                                        time for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States to negotiate with
                                        the oil companies a reasonable settlement of the
                                        “participation” issue. We believe the chances of a
                                        reasonable settlement would be diminished if the Saudis and
                                        the other moderates were confronted by a total Libyan
                                        takeover of the American companies; in such circumstances
                                        they would find themselves under pressure to nationalize
                                        completely as well.</p>
                                    <p>Even if the Libyans were to respond positively to our offer
                                        and we were to obtain a few months time, the basic problem
                                        would not be solved. There can be no guarantee that this or
                                        any other offer to Libya of a modest arms supply
                                        relationship will be effective, even in the short term. We
                                        believe Libya will move against the companies whenever it
                                        believes it can extract the maximum political and economic
                                        advantage. Arms deliveries will not permanently deflect
                                        Libya from such a move; at best, they may delay it. Such a
                                        delay should make a satisfactory settlement of the oil
                                        companies in Iraq more probable and should make the move
                                        toward total nationalization throughout OPEC less likely <pb
                                            n="5" xml:id="d90-05" facs="d90-05"/>over the near to
                                        mid-term. One of the serious disadvantages of this option is
                                        that it would link arms supply and oil in the Libyan mind,
                                        thereby opening us to Libyan blackmail.</p>
                                    <p>We must recognize nevertheless that the Libyans are attaching
                                        importance to obtaining some arms from us despite their
                                        extensive acquisitions from the French and the Russians.
                                        This is the only action they have hinted could lead to
                                        improved relations with the U.S. or at least to a less
                                        hostile attitude toward the oil companies. Under this option
                                        we would make clear to the Libyans that we expect improved
                                        relations would follow this gesture. If at any time during
                                        the period of the delivery of the aircraft Libya moved
                                        against the companies, shipments could be stopped and so
                                        could shipments of spare parts for the aircraft and other
                                        equipment of American origin that Libya now has in its
                                        inventory. Although Libya could assume that its ploy of
                                        linking arms and oil had worked and could ask for more
                                        sophisticated equipment (such as Sidewinders and C-130's),
                                        each new case could be discussed for a long period and
                                        deliveries prolonged over an extended period of several
                                        years. Libyan oil will decline in relative importance during
                                        the next decade, and any additional time the companies might
                                        have to operate in Libya would be valuable.</p>
                                    <p>Although Israel could be mollified by an advance warning of
                                        our action and an explanation of it, any supply of arms to
                                        Libya would present grave problems both domestically and
                                        with more moderate countries in the Mediterranean area.
                                        Libya has intervened in the internal affairs of Morocco, has
                                        supported extreme Palestine groups, and has supported
                                        dissidents in numerous countries.</p>

                                        companies, we would indicate to the Libyans that we
                                        recognize their desire for increased participation and that
                                        we will not oppose participation along lines agreed upon
                                        between Saudi Arabia and Aramco. At the same time we would
                                        urge the Libyans not to undertake any sudden or preemptive
                                        nationalizations since this would obviously create
                                        difficulties for the kind of smooth transition which is in

                                        arrangements between the companies and Libya in which the

                                    <p>Saudi Arabia and Aramco are currently negotiating a partial
                                        nationalization which would begin with a 20% participation
                                        by the government in Aramco increasing to 51% probably over
                                        a period of five years. At least two of the American Aramco
                                        partners and probably a third are resigned to accepting such
                                        an arrangement with the most serious bar to agreement
                                        probably residing in the terms for compensation. The
                                        settlement reached in Saudi Arabia is to apply also to Libya
                                        in accordance with the OPEC arrangements. Most of the
                                        American companies in Libya are prepared to accept this
                                        fact, but their willingness to do so has not been
                                        communicated by them to the Libyans who may, in any event,
                                        want more than 51% and want it sooner than five years.</p>
                                    <p>If the U.S. were to accept the option of orderly
                                        nationalization and indicate its acceptance to the Libyans,
                                        it would be taking a step less palatable to the oil
                                        companies than a “symbolic” political or military gesture.
                                        Also, it could put the U.S. in the position of appearing to
                                        support nationalizations. The option could not be exercised
                                        without further high level consultations with the
                                        companies.</p>
                                    <p>The main advantage of this option would be its separation of
                                        the oil and arms supply issues from each other. Having <pb

                                        political concessions.</p>

                                        that the Libyans will proceed to nationalize on their own
                                        timetable and that any intervention on our part is not
                                        likely to be effective, we could take no action.</p>
                                    <p>While there are signs of a clear Libyan intention to move at
                                        some point against some or all of the companies, we have no
                                        firm evidence that they have made such a decision. We have
                                        no certainty that the interventions proposed under options 1
                                        or 2 would achieve the purpose of buying time or deterring
                                        nationalization. We have made clear to the Libyan Government
                                        and to the companies our current policy of not supplying
                                        arms to Libya. Although the companies would like to have us
                                        make a symbolic gesture, they understand the difficulties we
                                        face in doing so. The Libyans probably do not expect further
                                        moves from us.</p>
                                    <p>Under these circumstances we could continue to talk with the
                                        Libyans along the lines of our present policy but take no
                                        action specifically with respect either to the planes or to
                                        the question of nationalization.</p>
                                    <p>The disadvantages of this are that it leaves us open to
                                        charges that we have not been sufficiently active in
                                        protecting the major American interests involved. The
                                        advantage would be that it would not draw us further into
                                        the efforts by Libya to use the companies to extract arms
                                        and changes in policy from us.</p>
                                    <p>We are submitting the foregoing for your review and for such

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to share with you an inside view of the
                            situation in Libya as it may affect our oil companies there over the
                            next month or so. Those companies live under the constant threat of
                            cutbacks in their production, and now we have reports that the
                            government is planning to nationalize three of them on September 1, the
                            anniversary of the Libyan revolution. The US government has been brought
                            into this situation — ostensibly because of our arms policy toward Libya
                            but actually because of our policy toward the Arab-Israel problem.</p>
                        <p>The event which led to the present situation took place in mid-June when
                            Libyan oil negotiator and now Prime Minister JALLUD called in the heads
                            of the oil companies doing business in Libya and told them that their
                            position is jeopardized because of the US government policy of refusing
                            to provide arms to Libya. He exaggerated in describing Libya requests to
                            the US which he said had been turned down, but as you know there are
                            still 8 F-5 aircraft dating from a commitment made prior to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s takeover which have never been
                            delivered. We agreed to sell them at a time when we were working with
                            the Libyan air force as a means of holding our position at Wheelus
                            Airbase. After the revolutionary command deposed King <persName
                                corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>, we held the remaining eight
                            aircraft under that contract “under review,” and that is still their
                            status. Another dimension of this problem for the future is that the
                            Libyans have ordered 8 C-130s through commercial channels for delivery
                            next year, and the issue of licensing them will come up at some
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The situation within Libya provides the reason why we have been as
                            reluctant to say “no” as we have to say “yes” on the F-5s. We have <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d91-02" facs="d91-02"/>not said “yes” because of the
                            problem of appearing to support the radical Libyan regime. However,
                            among those people working most closely with Dick Helms on this problem
                            there is a view that failure to release those planes is a major
                            irritant. They feel that whatever moderation exists in Libya today —
                            particularly toward our oil companies— is the work of one very strong
                            faction headed by Al Houni, who is the Minister of the Interior and the
                            head of the intelligence and security services. He is third in power to
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>, although he lacks
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s charisma and does
                            not have a popular base. He does have a substantial in-government
                            following among those who feel that Libya should maintain its
                            relationships with Western Europe and the US. It is <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s judgment that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s more radical instincts would
                            dominate if it were not for Al Houni and his faction.</p>
                        <p>Here is where the aircraft come in. Apparently Al Houni has argued [text
                            not declassfied] that the issue is not so much the aircraft in
                            themselves because the Libyans have more than they can handle in the
                            French Mirages but the fact that the US appears to be applying some sort
                            of double standard to Libya by refusing to honor a previous contract. Al
                            Houni points out that the nationalization of British petroleum interests
                            in Libya was the result of a flash reaction to British arms policy. He
                            feels the same could happen to the US companies.</p>
                        <p>No one argues that fulfilling the terms of the original contract would
                            buy us a significantly different situation in Libya. Our basic problem
                            is that we are dealing with a government that has no time for us because
                            of our Arab-Israeli policy. Libyan attitudes toward us are not likely to
                            change until the Arab-Israeli situation changes, if then. However, one
                            school of thought argues that releasing the aircraft would remove the
                            one specific bilateral bone of contention between our governments. There
                            would be plenty of continuing issues in the Arab-Israeli dispute, but
                            there would be no remaining bilateral evidence that the US was somehow
                            treating Libya differently. The oil companies have not pressed us to
                            release those aircraft, but if some of them are nationalized after the
                            approach that has been made to them on pressing our government to change
                            its arms policy, there will be some room for criticism.</p>
                        <p>This is one of those situations where there seems to be no answer. It is
                            difficult to see us releasing even 8 F-5s to Libya now — and equally
                            difficult to believe that it would change the Libyan attitude toward us
                            significantly. At the same time, it is not difficult to see further
                            moves against the oil companies, although that is not certain in the
                            immediate future. <pb n="3" xml:id="d91-03" facs="d91-03"/>The only
                            steps one can envision in this situation are small and may not do much
                            good. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                                companies as to warrant serious consideration of releasing at least
                                a couple of the 8 F-5s now with a tentative promise to release the
                                rest next year?</hi>

                        </list>
                        <p>You have indicated that you thought we “should consider” releasing the
                            eight F-5 aircraft which the Libyans want and asked how we would
                            proceed.</p>
                        <p>We could begin by asking State for its views. As it turns out, however,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has just
                            completed a review of our arms policy toward Libya and has concluded
                            that “any modification of the present arms supply policy would not buy
                            much, if any, security for American oil companies.” This was based on
                            the view that the Libyans are probably bent on nationalizing the entire
                            oil industry and will do so no matter what we do whenever it best suits
                            their political and other purposes. It was also concluded that the
                            major, and probably overriding, factor determining U.S.-Libyan
                            relations, and probably also the future of the oil companies, is the
                            intense Libyan hostility towards our policy on the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the Secretary has decided that there should be no change in
                            our present policy of providing no new weapons to Libya, but attempting
                            to avoid a direct “Yes-No” confrontation over the F-5s. Spares for
                            previously supplied equipment, including aircraft, will continue to be
                            sold and the U.S. approval of the Italian sale of U.S. origin <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s and artillery will remain in effect.
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> has
                            informed the oil companies.</p>
                        <p>The problem, therefore, boils down to whether or not you wish to override
                            State on this one or ride along with the actions they have just taken to
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d92-02" facs="d92-02"/>revalidate the present
                            policy. If you did want to go ahead, it would probably mean selling all
                            eight aircraft, since dribbling them out would not reduce and might even
                            raise Libyan sensitivities. This could be done in a low-key way but,
                            given the situation in the Middle East, could not be kept secret.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that this is not a particularly good time to change our
                            Libyan arms policy. For one thing, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> is an anathma to the Israelis because of his
                            strong support of the fedayeen, financial subsidizing of Egypt and
                            tending to push Sadat toward radical solutions. He is also opposed to
                            Arab friends like Kings Hussein, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and Faisal and has made contributions to radical
                            groups in the U.S. like the Black Panthers. But more important is the
                            fact that the hostile Libyan attitude toward the U.S. is not likely to
                            change until the Arab-Israeli situation changes, if then. As for the oil
                            companies, from all indications they are living on borrowed time in
                            Libya no matter what happens, so long as the present regime remains in
                            power.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Recommendation:</hi> That we stick with the present
                            arms policy toward Libya subject to later review if the situation

                            UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR THREE YEARS TO SETTLE THIS MATTER. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> BELIEVES THAT F-5's POSE MAJOR ISSUE
                            BETWEEN US AND LIBYA ASIDE FROM PALESTINE PROBLEM. NOTING THAT US IS
                            PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH PHANTOMS, KIKHIA ASKED WHY LIBYA CANNOT RECEIVE
                            EIGHT OR NINE F-5'S.</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SOMEWHAT SINCE
                            CONTRACT SIGNED. HE ASKED HOW MANY MIRAGE AIRCRAFT LIBYA NOW HAS. <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID INVENTORY IS SUPPOSED TO REACH 100
                            BUT NOW STANDSAT ABOUT 30. SECRETARY EXPRESSED US CONCERN ABOUT WHAT
                            LIBYA APPEARS TO BE DOING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. <gloss target="#t_FM1"
                                >FM</gloss> REPLIED THAT LIBYA IS FIGHTING AGAINST COLONIALISM.
                            SECRETARY ASKED WHAT <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> WOULD DO WITH
                            ADDITIONAL F-5's. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> REPLIED THEY WOULD
                            BE USED FOR DEFENSE. SECRETARY ASKED AGAINST WHOM. <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> STRESSED THAT LIBYA NEEDS AIR FORCE FOR
                            ITS DEFENSE AND SEES US STANCE ON DELIVERIES OF F-5's AS PRESSURE
                            AGAINST IT. SECRETARY SAID THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT LIBYA SHOULD
                            HAVE ARMED FORCES TO ENSURE ITS DEFENSES. HOWEVER, US IS CONCERNED ABOUT
                            SIZE OF LIBYAN MILITARY FORCE. KIKHIA POINTED OUT THAT IT WILL BE MANY
                            YEARS BEFORE LIBYA HAS ENOUGH PILOTS TO FLY ITS AIRCRAFT. MOREOVER,
                            THERE IS NO QUESTION OF LIBYAN AIR FORCE PLAYING OFFENSIVE ROLE. LIBYA
                            NEEDS GOOD AIR FORCE BECAUSE IT IS VERY LARGE COUNTRY, WITH VERY LONG
                            BORDERS. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> SAID THAT US IS
                            CONTINUALLY CONSIDERING QUESTION OF F-S'S BUT <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
                                >GOL</gloss> SHOULD KNOW THAT ISSUE INVOLVES PHRASE IN CONTRACT
                            LIMITING, AIRCRAFT TO DEFENSIVE PURPOSES AND PROHIBITING THEIR TRANSFER
                            TO OR USE BY COUNTRIES OTHER THAN LIBYA. FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETIME AGO
                            LIBYAN F-5's WERE SENT TO PAKISTAN. THIS POSED DIFFICULT LEGAL PROBLEMS
                            FOR US. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> STRESSED THAT US
                            MUST BE SURE THAT F-S'S WILL BE USED FOR PURPOSES STIPULATED IN
                            CONTRACT.</p>
                        <p>6. KIKHIA SAID THAT WHEN <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> WORKED OUT
                            AGREEMENT ON WHEELUS, IT CONCLUDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO REMAINING
                            COMPLICATIONS IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US. ON PURELY BILATERAL SIDE,
                            MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF PETROLEUM ACTIVITY IN LIBYA IS BY US COMPANIES.
                            US SHOULD NOTE THAT LIBYA IS ONLY COUNTRY IN AREA WHICH FIGHTS SO HARD
                            AGAINST COMMUNISM. LIBYA MAY DISAGREE WITH US ON MID-EAST ISSUE, BUT
                            THAT IS MID-EAST MATTER. SECRETARY SAID US DOES NOT MIND DISAGREEING
                            WITH LIBYA ON MID-EAST; IT ALSO DISAGREES WITH SOME OTHER ARAB STATES.
                            HOWEVER, WHAT DOES CONCERN US ARE VITRIOLIC ATTACKS WHICH COME FROM
                            LIBYA. CERTAIN <pb n="3" xml:id="d93-03" facs="d93-03"/>LIBYAN
                            STATEMENTS HAVE SUGGESTED <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>
                            INTERFERENCE IN AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. KIKHIA ASKED WHETHER
                            SECRETARY WAS REFERRING TO IRELAND. SECRETARY SAID HE WAS REFERRING TO
                            LIBYA'S NEIGHBORS, WHICH HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT LIBYA'S ATTITUDES.
                            SECRETARY SAID US WANTS GOOD RELATIONS WITH LIBYA. THIS WAS PROVEN WHEN
                            US VACATED WHEELUS WHEN <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> ASKED, EVEN
                            THOUGH LEASE HAD NOT YET EXPIRED. KIKHIA SAID LIBYA HAS NO REAL QUARREL
                            WITH US BUT IS DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT US CONTINUES TO SIDE WITH LIBYA'S
                            ENEMY, ISRAEL.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> REMARKED THAT US WONDERS
                            WHY <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> ATTACHES SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE
                            TO F-5 CONTRACT. ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP SEEMS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO BOTH
                            LIBYA AND US. MOREOVER, IT MAY BE IN BEST INTERST OF US AND LIBYA TO END
                            MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. LIBYA'S POSITION ON MID-EAST AND OTHER ISSUES
                            FRANKLY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP.
                            KIKHIA AGREED THAT LIBYA WISHES TO PRESERVE CULTURAL TIES WITH US,
                            ESPECIALLY PROGRAMS TO SEND LIBYANS TO US UNIVERSITIES. HE SAID,
                            HOWEVER, THAT F-5 PROBLEM LOOMS LARGE. SECRETARY TOLD <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> THAT US WILL CONTINUE TO EXAMINE
                            QUESTION. (IN A BRIEF MEETING FOLLOWING SESSION WITH SECRETARY, MAGHUR
                            TOLD <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> LIBYANS WOULD BE
                            PREPARED RETURN ALL PRESENT F-5's TO US AND WIPE OUT CONTRACT IF US SO
                            WISHED. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> SAID HE WOULD SO
                            INFORM SECRETARY BUT REPEATED THAT SECRETARY DESIRED TAKE FURTHER LOOK
                            AT QUESTION OVER NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.)</p>
                        <p>8. MID-EAST: SECRETARY SAID THAT US IS EAGER TO FIND SOLUTION TO MID-EAST
                            PROBLEM. US HAS NO QUARREL WITH ARABS AND MOST OF THEM SEEM TO LIKE US
                            BETTER THAN COMMUNISTS. THIS MAY BE BECAUSE ARABS KNOW THAT US IS NOT UP
                            TO ANYTHING. <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> SHOULD KNOW THAT US
                            RECOGNIZES JUSTICE OF PALESTINIAN CLAIM. PROBLEM IS HOW TO SETTLE IT
                            FAIRLY. SECRETARY NOTED THAT ARABS DO NOT HELP PROBLEM BY SPEAKING WITH
                            SO MANY VOICES. SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT US HAS ALSO HAD ITS PROBLEM
                            WITH ISRAEL WITH CERTAIN US PROPOSALS TAKING CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES.
                            IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT FINAL SETTLEMENT CANNOT MEET ALL DEMANDS OF BOTH
                            SIDES. HOWEVER, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SETTLEMENT BY
                            GETTING MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY. SECRETARY EMPHASIZED THAT ACTS
                            OF TERRORISM CAN ONLY HARM ARAB CAUSE. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            REPLIED THAT PALESTINIANS ARE FRUSTRATED, DISPERSED, AND DIFFICULT TO
                            SPEAK WITH. LIBYANS KNOW HOW THEY FEEL. UNDER ITALY'S CONTROL 40 PERCENT
                            OF ARAB POPULATION OF LIBYA WAS EXTERMINATED. LIBYANS UNDERSTAND WHY
                            PALESTINIANS FIGHT WITH ALL MEANS THEY HAVE. <pb n="4" xml:id="d93-04"
                                facs="d93-04"/>SECRETARY ASKED WHETHER <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
                                >GOL</gloss> BELIEVES THAT TERRORISM WILL ACHIEVE ARAB GOALS. KIKHIA
                            REPLIED THAT TERRORISM COULD SERVE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO ARAB CAUSE.
                            SECRETARY COUNTERED AGAIN THAT TERRORISM CAN ONLY HARM THEIR CAUSE.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID THAT US CAN PLAY USEFUL ROLE BY
                            NOT CONTINUING ITS EXAGGERATED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. US PROVIDES ISRAEL
                            WITH MAJOR MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE BUT REFUSES TO DELIVER SMALL
                            NUMBER OF F-5's TO LIBYA. ARAB WORLD HAS SEEN CLEARLY THAT US GIVES TOP
                            PRIORITY TO ISRAEL. ONE NEED LOOK ONLY AT WHAT US HAS DONE IN LEBANON
                            AND JORDAN TO PROVE THIS POINT. SECRETARY SAID <gloss target="#t_FM1"
                                >FM</gloss> IS ONLY ARAB THAT HAS EXPRESSED THOSE SENTIMENTS TO HIM.
                            KIKHIA SUGGESTED THAT OTHERS ARE PERHAPS MORE DIPLOMATIC. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> REMARKED THAT LIBYA WAS ONE OF
                            FEW ARAB COUNTRIES TO REJECT <gloss target="#t_SCRES1">SC RES</gloss>
                            242. SECRETARY SAID THAT IN HIS TRAVELS TO OTHER ARAB STATES, IN ALL HIS
                            CONVERSATIONS WITH ARAB LEADERS AND COMMON PEOPLE, THESE SENTIMENTS HAVE
                            NOT BEEN EXPRESSED. HE SAID THAT LIBYA DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ARAB WORLD.
                            SECRETARY SUGGESTED LIBYA TAKE MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH, CALM ITS HARSH
                            STATEMENTS AND DROP ITS SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. SECRETARY SAID BEST HOPE
                            FOR MID-EAST SETTLEMENT PROBABLY LIES IN INDIRECT DISCUSSIONS. KIKHIA
                            ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DISCUSSIONS. SECRETARY SAID THAT
                            RE-OPENING OF CANAL SHOULD BE FIRST PRIORITY, FOLLOWED BY MOVEMENT OF
                            EGYPTIANS TO SOME POINT ACROSS CANAL. NEXT STEP COULD BE TO ADOPT <gloss
                                target="#t_SCRES1">SC RES</gloss> 242 AND SEEK WORK OUT SOLUTION FOR
                            PALESTINE PEOPLE. KIKHIA ASKED HOW PROBLEMS OF PALESTINIANS WOULD BE
                            RESOLVED THROUGH SUCH A PROCEDURE. SECRETARY REPLIED THAT AMBASSADOR
                            JARRING COULD PURSUE MATTER AFTER <gloss target="#t_SCRES1">SC
                                RES</gloss> 242 WAS ADOPTED. SECRETARY CONCLUDED CONVERSATION BY
                            ASKING THAT HIS BEST REGARDS BE CONVEYED TO PRESIDENT <persName

                                OTHER STATES, BUT LAR HAS GAINED LITTLE THEREBY. LAR, LIKE <persName

                                TO SEEK ACCOMMODATION WITH <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                WHILE LAR FORTHRIGHTLY AND CONSISTENTLY HAS OPPOSED COMMUNISM IN

                                REPLIED THAT “MY COUNTRY FEELS THREATENED” AND THAT WEAPONS WOULD
                                ONLY BE USED DEFENSIVELY. ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT EXPLICIT, CLEAR
                                IMPLICATION WAS ONE OF CONCERN ABOUT AN ISRAELI ATTACK. I REMINDED

                                I WISHED TO RECIPROCATE IN SAME SPIRIT. I PICKED UP HIS EARLIER

                                NOT SPEAKING TO THE POINT: THE FACT WAS THAT LAR HAD SENT PLANES

                            <item>I SAID THAT I WOULD, OF COURSE, REPORT TO WASHINGTON HIS INTEREST
                                IN FURTHER ARMS ACQUISITIONS FROM THE US. AT THE SAME TIME, I WISHED
                                AGAIN TO BE FRANK. THE PAKISTANI ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM WAS ONLY ONE
                                ELEMENT. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT ARMS SUPPLY IS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE
                                SUBJECT THAT CAN ONLY BE DEALT WITH WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE
                                OVERALL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES. WE HAD TO FACE THE FACT THAT
                                THE PRESENT RELATIONSHIP IS DEFICIENT - CERTAINLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO
                                MAKE EXTENSIVE MILITARY COOPERATION A PROMISING FIELD UNDER PRESENT
                                CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN WITH STRONG ASSURANCES REGARDING DEFENSIVE USE,
                                THEREFORE, I WOULD NOT WISH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO BELIEVE ADVANCED
                                WEAPONRY COULD REALLY BE FORTHCOMING.</item>

                            <item>I WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER TOGETHER WHAT IS
                                WRONG WITH OUR OVERALL RELATIONSHIP AND SUGGESTED FOR OPENERS THAT
                                WE WHAT LACK IS A <pb n="6" xml:id="d94-06" facs="d94-06"
                                />CONTINUING DIALOGUE. OUR CONTACTS TEND TO BE INTERMITTENT MOST OF
                                THE TIME. WHEN DIALOGUE HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS, MAJOR PROBLEMS—E.G.
                                EVACUATION, TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS, SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS,
                                RELATIONS WITH OIL COMPANIES, ETC.—HAVE BEEN SMOOTHLY RESOLVED. WHAT
                                WE NEED IS FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHERS POINTS OF VIEW.
                                FOR EXAMPLE, I POINTED OUT, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                    >QADHAFI</persName> HAD SEVERAL TIMES EARLIER REFERRED TO THE
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'S “TOTAL COMMITMENT” TO
                                ISRAEL. THE US HAS NO SUCH COMMITMENT. THE US, I SAID, IS “TOTALLY
                                COMMITTED” ONLY TO ITS OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS. SO FAR AS ME IS
                                CONCERNED US STRONGLY SUPPORTS INDEPENDENCE OF <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> MEMBER ISRAEL, BUT IT EQUALLY
                                SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ARAB
                                NEIGHBORS, A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO ARAB-ISRAELI DISPUTE, AND JUSTICE
                                FOR PALESTINIANS, ALL WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> RESOLUTION 242. PERHAPS, I
                                SUGGESTED, THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IS ALSO AT FAULT
                                IN MISUNDERSTANDING LIBYAN POINTS OF VIEW. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HEAR
                                LIBYA SAYING THAT IT IS “TOTALLY OPPOSED” TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO
                                THE MIDDLE EASTERN PROBLEM. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS IS TRUE. BUT,
                                THIS IS WHAT I HEARD MAJOR JALLUD SAYING ONLY THE OTHER DAY. PEPHAPS
                                IF WE SPENT MORE TIME IN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WE WOULD DISCOVER
                                THAT FACILE GENERALIZATIONS ARE INCORRECT AND THAT THERE ARE
                                IMPORTANT AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST AND OVERLAP. I THEREFORE URGED ON

                                RISE TO STRONG DIFFERENCES OF OPINION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ISRAEL

                                TEMPORARY, IS NO LONGER CREDIBLE. AFTER TWO OR MORE YEARS IT IS
                                TANTAMOUNT TO A REFUSAL TO DELIVER. I PERSONALLY STILL RECOMMEND WE
                                DELIVER 8 F-5B'S AND THUS FULFILL THE CONTRACT SATISFACTORLY. BUT I
                                CANNOT SAY THIS WOULD DO MORE THAN POSSIBLY KEEP US OFF THE SLIPPERY
                                SLOPE: NO MORE SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF IT. IF HOWEVER WE CANNOT DECIDE
                                TO DELIVER, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DECIDE NOT TO DELIVER AND TELL THE
                                    <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> WHY. THERE ARE ADEQUATE

                                RIGHT TO WITHDRAW ALSO. I DO NOT THINK THAT SAYING SO WOULD SURPRISE

                        </list>
                        <p>I share your concern with the FBI report which indicates the Libyan
                            Ambassador is connected with potential terrorist activities in the US.
                            We believe <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> was initially
                            reluctant to support terrorism outside the Middle East, believing that
                            Arabs should concentrate on guerilla activities aimed directly against
                            Israel and the occupied territories. However, as you point out, there is
                            growing evidence <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> is
                            willing to support terrorism outside the Middle East which, in his view,
                            may have become a necessary if temporary expedient. As Embassy Tripoli
                            has pointed out in a recent airgram (A-176 of 23 November, attached)
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s approach towards
                            terrorism in general has not been unambiguous.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, I am afraid there is nothing we can say now directly to
                            the Libyan Ambassador about proper diplomatic conduct which would not
                            possibly risk compromising the FBI report. We may, however, have
                            occasion to talk with the Libyan Ambassador in the near future on
                            another subject. If so, we may be able to make some general remarks
                            deploring terrorism which is so often directed against innocent third
                            parties.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The Tripoli daily newspaper, al-Faji al-Jadid, on November 14,
                            1972 featured a news report heavily larded with editorial content
                            regarding terrorism. The substance of the reportage is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>, while it must defend and justify
                            terrorist operations mounted by Palestinians and their sympathizers,
                            sees little benefit to the Arab Cause accruing as a result of those
                            operations and would strongly prefer that Fedayeen operations be
                            confined to Israel and the surrounding Arab countries. Al-Fajr may be
                            regarded, in our view, as an authoritative mouthpiece for the <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> regime. Lamentable, the paper
                            gave no indication that the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> is
                            prepared to use its moral and financial influence with the Fedayeen to
                            reflect its reservations about “unlimited terrorism.”</p>

                        <p>Under the headline, “Secret Decisions of the American Government against
                            Arabs Residing in the United States,” Tripoli's daily al-Fajr al-Jadid
                            November 14, 1972 reported that the “huge wave of anti-Arab propaganda
                            now sweeping Europe and the United States is directed in general against
                            the Arab States and in particular against LAR.” Al-Fajr said that the
                            release of their “comrade commandos” from “enemy prisons” by the
                            Lufthansa hijackers and the fact that all the commandos sought asylum in
                            LAR sparked this propaganda and the “violent, anti-Arab measures by
                            governmental and semi-official authorities in Europe and the United
                            States” directed against Arab students and <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03"
                                facs="d96-03"/>laborers.</p>
                        <p>Al-Fajr reproduced part of an article published recently by the
                            Washington Star and headlined, “Secret Memo of the State Department
                            Restricts Arab Visits to the United States.” The Star reported that
                            secret <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decisions “against the Arabs”
                            were implemented beginning October 19. Al-Fajr also referred to the
                            resolve of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> to “protect every Zionist in the United States,
                            liquidate, all elements supporting the Arab Cause, confiscate all Arab
                            publications concerning the Arab Cause and silence every voice
                            supporting that Cause, particularly among Arab students in American
                            Universities.” The US aims at making Arabs in America feel that everyone
                            moving and speaking in favor of that Cause is subject to surveillance by
                            American Intelligence, and at subduing and humiliating the national
                            feelings of Arab students while bolstering Zionists feelings of pride
                            that they enjoy American support of their State, the paper said.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Al-Fajr charged, at the University of North Carolina “Arab
                            students—including eight Libyans—were subject to ridiculous questions
                            such as, 'Why does Libya help the Commando Organizations? What do you
                            know about these Organizations? Do you know any Palestinian student
                            here? Do you promise not to talk about the Palestinian Problem? Do you
                            have any circulars or pictures or statements regarding the Palestinian
                            Cause?'”</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">LAR Position?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Al-Fajr in commenting on the above, asserted that the United States and
                            Britain were “motivated by Zionist Intelligence to take advantage of
                            what they call 'Terrorism', in order to justify the committing of more
                            acts of aggression. “It is strange that they forgot that the Zionists
                            were the first people to use terrorism through their terrorist bands of
                            Irgun, Stern, and Hagana.” The paper asked, “What benefits accrue to the
                            Arabs as a result of these acts of terrorism? Are the Arabs getting any
                            benefits?” “Of course not. In fact, the Arabs are the only ones harmed
                            by these terrorist operations.”</p>
                        <p>“In fact” Al-Fajr concludes the Arab States, particularly the LAR, bear
                            with deep conviction their responsibility <pb n="4" xml:id="d96-04"

                            whose home has been usurped by Terrorism; their struggle to restore

                            conviction, the LAR received the Munich commandos.</p>

                            the Palestinian Cause because they provoke hostility against the Arabs
                            and tend to increase disunity among the several Commando organizations.
                            Moreover, the behavior of the LAR's top leadership towards terrorists
                            over the last several months tends to confirm <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> displeasure with their operations. Tripoli's media made

                            killed in Munich. Rather, private Libyan citizens reportedly initiated
                            and financed the arrangements for the funeral in Tripoli and no <gloss

                            ceremonies. Also, it was noteworthy that during the time the Lufthansa
                            hijackers were in Tripoli, including the occasion of their press
                            conference, no <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members were on hand.
                            Indeed, there was no public mention of any contacts between them or

                        <p>On the other hand, foreigners' suggestions that the <gloss

                            such terrorists—described locally as “Commando heroes"—excites the scorn

                        <p>As is his wont, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> would like
                            to have his cake and eat it too; he ipso facto abets Fedayeen terrorist
                            activities with Libyan funds and defends their operations anywhere, even
                            though he would prefer that a unified commando movement, in tandem with

                        <p>I. SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>Soviet drive into Western Mediterranean and defection of France from NATO
                            underline importance of strategic US presence and facilities in Morocco
                            and their integral role in Western defense system. Excellent relations
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> have kept US presence intact,
                            but Soviet influence has grown rapidly. In face of massive influx of
                            Soviet arms and technicians into Algeria as part of Soviet policy of
                            cut-rate arms sales to create exploitable areas of tension, national
                            security and economic development are Morocco's prime concerns. US and
                            Western economic and military aid have not been fully responsive to
                            these concerns. At same time, Arab-Israel confrontation generates
                            pressures on King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> to adopt
                            more neutral posture and to align Morocco with Arab extremists. In this
                            connection, concern that Middle East tensions could provoke major
                            conflagration has created nascent receptivity in Morocco to Yugoslav,
                            Spanish and French proposals for neutralization of Mediterranean through
                            withdrawal of US and Soviet fleets. <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is prepared to help King economically and, in
                            difficult years ahead, to exploit threats to Moroccan stability to
                            detriment of US. In these circumstances, US also may face return to
                            grant military assistance or prospect of concessionary Soviet military
                            aid to Morocco. Clear mark of Soviet interest in Morocco is <persName

                            Strategic importance and economic potential of Morocco warrant special
                            effort to blunt Soviet drive. Higher levels of US-inspired multilateral
                            and bilateral economic aid supplemented by grant military assistance
                            would go far toward giving <pb n="2" xml:id="d97-02" facs="d97-02"/>King
                            greater sense of security within context of improving economy. Morocco
                            is Western-oriented and King would prefer association with West. Like
                            most leaders, however, he feels bound to act according to his view of
                            Morocco's vital interests.</p>

                                <p>Primary importance of Morocco is its strategic location
                                    commanding entrance to Mediterranean. US presence in Morocco
                                    helps assure against harassment of Sixth Fleet use of Straits of
                                    Gibraltar and lines of supply and communications to southern
                                    NATO and CENTO countries. Morocco also provides site for vital

                                    relay station. Thus, continued US presence in Morocco is
                                    integral part of Western defense system. French defection from
                                    NATO, Soviet naval buildup in Western Mediterranean and growing
                                    Soviet military and economic presence in Algeria further enhance
                                    strategic importance of Morocco to US.</p>

                        <p>Foregoing future projection stresses dangers to vital US interests in
                            Morocco, but, we believe, accurately portrays forces at work inside and
                            outside Morocco and direction of their thrust. US faces difficult period
                            ahead when conjunction of Moroccan domestic economic problems, expanding
                            Soviet influence, uncertain relations with Algeria, and Arab-Israel
                            problem could seriously damage US position in Morocco. Judicious and
                            adequate response to Moroccan concerns about security and economic
                            development, however, would enable US to take maximum advantage of
                            existing assets such as pro-Western orientation of King <persName

                            Moreover, Morocco, unlike many African and Middle Eastern countries, has
                            human and material resources necessary for successful transition from
                            underdevelopment to economic viability in modern world. Strategic
                            importance of Morocco, its economic potential and manageable size and
                            nature of its development problems argue that US consider Morocco
                            intensive aid target. Higher levels of US-inspired multilateral and
                            bilateral economic aid supplemented by small, but continuing grant
                            military assistance program would go far toward counteracting effect of

                        <p>After a brief private meeting with the President, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> made a formal presentation of his
                            message from King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            stressing that the King's interest was in preserving the spiritual and
                            moral bond with the U.S. He expressed the King's sincere and profound
                            friendship. The King, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName>, regards President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> as the spiritual son of President EISENHOWER for
                            whom the King had such a high regard. President EISENHOWER was
                            outstanding in faithfulness which he showed to friends of the U.S. whom
                            he supported without reservations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> said that the present
                            political situation in North Africa was a source of great concern to the
                            King of Morocco. He cited recent developments in Libya and in Tunisia.
                            The Moroccan reaction was to see the progress of extremism and
                            subversion across North Africa. The King wondered to what extent the
                            leader of the free world would follow passively these developments. The
                            King asked the question before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName> left “Where does the U.S. plan to establish its
                            last defense against subversion?”</p>
                        <p>Morocco, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName>, has set
                            its path and is on its way to the difficult goal of bringing a good life
                            to its people. It is also seeking to make its contribution to peace in
                            the Middle East as well as in the Mediterranean area. The King brought
                            together the <pb n="2" xml:id="d99-02" facs="d99-02"/>leaders of the
                            Moslem world in a constructive fashion at the Islamic Conference.
                            Morocco can in the future play a significant role.</p>
                        <p>The King wished by his mission to show that his only concern was a
                            constructive relationship with the United States and the internal
                            strength of Morocco. Military strength was not a problem. The primary
                            problem was economic.</p>
                        <p>At a level to be decided by the President, the King hoped that a new
                            basis for cooperation “outside normal paperwork” could be established.
                            This would involve new procedures and a new policy.</p>
                        <p>In reply the President said he would welcome concrete suggestions from
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> as to what procedures
                            needed changing. The U.S. considers Morocco a strong anchor in the
                            Mediterranean and wants to keep it that way.</p>
                        <p>(In a subsequent conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName> was more specific about what the King had in
                            mind. He said the King wished to lay this groundwork for a possible
                            visit in the future at which time he and the President could map out the
                            level of cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> that the
                            Department would consider the approach made to the President and would
                            send further comments to the Moroccan Government.)</p>

                                have tended to look at the North African situation on a pragmatic

                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> fears that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s next step will be to eliminate
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumedienne</persName> of Algeria
                            in favor of someone more willing to accept his leadership in the Arab
                            world. The elimination of <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumedienne</persName>, according to the King, would greatly
                            increase the subversive potential of both Nasser and the Soviets in
                            Tunisia and Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The King would like the U.S. to use whatever appropriate influence is
                            available to prevent <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s and
                            Soviet plans in the Maghreb countries from succeeding. He feels that
                            unless we take a positive interest in this matter, there is a real
                            danger that the entire littoral of the southern Mediterranean, from the
                            UAR to Morocco, is likely to fall to Communist domination.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has been
                            understandably nervous since the Libyan coup. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s growing influence in Libya has
                            contributed further to his agitation, even though there is no immediate
                            organized threat to his throne. The lining up of Morocco, Tunisia and
                            Algeria against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s demands
                            at the recent Arab summit—and Hassan's moderating influence there—have
                            probably also contributed to his fear that Morocco may be close to the
                            top of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s list for
                            reprisal.</p>

                                >Hassan</persName>'s impression during the Arab summit that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would like to conclude
                            an agreement with Israel but fears overthrow if he did. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> feels that the Palestinians—not
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>—are the key to a
                            settlement now.</p>
                        <p>All of this indicates the need for a systematic review of the North

                                JUST THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN. THE ONLY OUTSTANDING POINT STILL IN
                                LITIGATION WAS SPANISH SAHARA. AS EVERYONE KNEW, THIS TERRITORY WAS
                                ARAB IN POPULATION. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> RESOLUTION
                                ADVOCATING SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF SPANISH SAHARA HAD
                                BEEN INTRODUCED BY MOROCCO. THIS SHOWED THAT MOROCCO WAS NOT
                                INTERESTED IN EXPANSION OR ANNEXATION. HOWEVER, MOROCCO'S APPROACHES
                                TO SPAIN, INCLUDING KING <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >HASSAN</persName>'S VISIT TO MADRID IN 1969, HAD NOT BORNE
                                FRUIT. IT WAS THE STRATEGIC, NOT ECONOMIC SIDE OF SPANISH SAHARA
                                WHICH INTERESTED MOROCCO. ISSUE OF SAHARAN PHOSPHATES HAD BEEN BLOWN
                                UP OUT OF ALL PROPORTION. THERE WAS A RESERVE OF ONLY ONE AND A HALF
                                BILLION TONS OF PHOSPHATE IN SPANISH SAHARA, WHEREAS THE MOROCCAN
                                RESERVE WAS 20 BILLION. THE COST OF PRODUCING SAHARAN PHOSPHATES
                                WOULD BE LESS THAN IN THE USA OR MOROCCO. HOWEVER, PHOSPHATE
                                PRODUCTION IN MOROCCO WAS A STATE MONOPOLY. THE STATE COULD MAKE THE
                                NECESSARY SACRIFICES OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD IF IT WISHED TO
                                OVERWHELM SAHARAN PHOSPHATES. POPULATION OF SPANISH SAHARA WAS VERY

                                TO THE ATLANTIC. MOROCCO HAD NOT GIVEN UP HOPE OF REACHING AN

                                FOLLOW. HE SAID HIS MAJESTY HAD TRIED TO LEAD ALGERIAN REGIME TOWARD

                                SHOWN CERTAIN CONCURRENCE OF VIEWS BETWEEN ALGERIAN AND MOROCCAN

                                RELATIONS WERE IMPROVING, AS INDICATED BY LARGE EL PASO CONTRACT. US
                                WOULD BE HAPPY RENEW RELATIONS WHENEVER ALGERIANS WISHED. IT AGREED
                                ALSO THAT MAGHREB UNITY SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. HE WAS GLAD

                                GREAT POWERS DID NOT SUCCEED IN IMPOSING PEACE, THERE WAS RISK OF

                                IMPOSSIBLE IN VIEW OF HATRED AND DISTRUST BETWEEN ARABS AND

                                IRAQ, SUDAN, AND LIBYA. THE SCREW WAS BEING TIGHTENED. THE TREND WAS

                                FAILURE. A SOLUTION ACCEPTABLE TO THE PALESTINIANS WHO WERE
                                REALISTIC, AS MOROCCO HAD OBSERVED AT THE ARAB SUMMIT, WOULD BE A
                                JUST SOLUTION. IT WAS ADMITTEDLY DIFFICULT TO ASK SUCH PIONEERS OF

                        <p>1. Morocco. Although reports often conflicting, three developments have
                            recently disturbed Moroccan scene and led to almost constant state alert
                            among military and police forces. First, [text not declassified]military
                            plot against regime discovered late December or early January and some
                            military officers, all captains or below, summarily executed. Second,
                            according to press and intelligence reports, six or more Moroccan
                            terrorists were apprehended in Spain in January. Their reported
                            objectives were assassination of King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and, according one report, <persName

                            student unrest, including strikes after Id al Kebir holidays, is highly

                            and butter issues appear, at least on surface, major concern of

                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is sending Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> as a special
                            emissary to discuss with you deterioration in the Mid-Eastern situation.
                            This initiative results from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s request that the King intervene personally with
                            you to underscore the seriousness of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s peace appeal to you. Comparable emissaries have
                            already been received by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1"
                                >Wilson</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_PG1"

                                    Moscow has not been constructive on either count. This has been

                            <item>The Prime Minister said King Hasson thought the recent appeal from
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was a
                                positive element in the Middle East situation. He does not believe
                                that direct negotiations are possible in the present circumstances.
                                Rather, a settlement would have to be reached through indirect or
                                secret negotiation. Morocco is seriously concerned about the decline
                                of US influence in the Mediterranean and the Near East. If no
                                solution is found to the present conflict the whole area will
                                increasingly drift away from Western influence and the <gloss

                                influence. Morocco believes that in view of Israel's air and

                                seriously. The US must use its influence to bring Israel to accept

                                restraint. He said the US stood by the principle of Israel's right
                                to exist and that Israel's position in relation to its neighbors
                                should not be weakened. The US is concerned about the introduction

                            <item>The President said that discussions were being held with Israel,
                                with the Russians, and also at the Four-Power Conferences, to arrive
                                at a just <pb n="4" xml:id="d105-04" facs="d105-04"/>and balanced
                                solution. Our conversations with the Russians have been quite
                                unsuccessful. The President also stated that our policy towards the
                                Middle East is still under review, that there are frequent meetings
                                on the Middle East, and that there would be one next week. It could
                                be that nothing dramatic would come out of the meeting. He
                                appreciated today's thoughtful and constructive conversation.</item>

                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the

                        <p>In a July 9 birthday message to the Moroccan people, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> announced plans to end the
                            “state of exception” by which he has ruled since June 7, 1965. He
                            intends to submit constitutional revisions to a referendum on July 24,
                            then provide for a two-round election, on August 21 and 28, for a
                            unicameral parliament. While he has not yet made public the precise
                            powers of the new legislative body, they will presumably be very limited
                            and clearly subordinate to those of the monarch.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The King's initiative seems to some observers a concession to various
                            domestic political pressures. Many educated Moroccans and the political
                            parties have resented the longevity and blatant absolutism of his
                            emergency rule. Anti-monarchical sentiment has risen since the fall of
                            Libya's Kinq Idris in September 1969. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s regime has been beset from
                            several quarters since late 1969. The discovery of a subversive group
                            prompted the rounding-up of some 400 left wing dissidents throughout the
                            country. Student unrest of unprecedented intensity led to university
                            strikes lasting nearly 11 weeks. Revelations of official corruption
                            embarrassed <pb n="2" xml:id="d106-02" facs="d106-02"/>the government
                            and raised nagging doubts about the accountability of high officials.
                            Irredentist elements, led by the conservative Istiqlal Party, erupted in
                            outrage after <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> recently
                            gave up Morocco's longstanding claims to Algerian-held territory.</p>

                        <p>None of these pressures, however, appears genuinely to have threatened
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s rule or even
                            influenced significantly his decision to restore parliament at this
                            time. He has had constitutional revisions under consideration for
                            several years. Moreover, various indications, starting in early 1969 and
                            multiplying after the October local elections, have suggested the
                            probability of a timetable to lift the “state of exception” sometime in
                            1970. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            taken extraordinary precautions to ensure the success of his plans and
                            to forestall any organized opposition. He made his announcement with
                            little forewarning and deliberately set early dates for the voting
                            exercises to coincide with the summer vacation season. He has also
                            issued veiled warnings to the electorate that rejection of the
                            referendum would mean continuation of the “state of exception” and to
                            political parties that those who preach boycott would find themselves
                            excluded from the political system.</p>

                            also extend to the composition of the parliament. He apparently plans to
                            draw at least one-half <pb n="3" xml:id="d106-03" facs="d106-03"/>of the

                            provincial assemblies, municipal and communal councils, and professional
                            chambers representing business, labor, and agriculture. He is
                            encouraging his cabinet ministers and other loyal aides to run for the
                            remaining seats. He presumably expects that his efficient Minister of
                            Interior will supervise the elections with the same magisterial aplomb

                            parliament and apprehensive about electoral rigging, will be under
                            severe pressure to “cooperate” with the palace and to participate.
                            However they decide, Hassan will be able to install a loyalist-dominated
                            legislature in early September and thereby add what could become a

                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s future actions will
                            determine whether he has created a new institutional bulwark for his
                            monarchy or has opened a Pandora's box. He will face a formidable
                            problem in making the new parliament a credible political institution.
                            Over the past nine years he has used the “divide and manipulate”
                            technique to hold power. He has factionalized the political elite,
                            including his most fervent supporters, to the point of immobilism. Just
                            as he divided the loyal majority in the 1963-65 parliament, he could do
                            the same with the loyal majority in the new body. Indeed, unless
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> decides to change his
                            tactics and to promote the development of a cohesive working majority,
                            perhaps under the aegis of a new political party or under another form
                            of leadership authority vested outside his person, he will risk
                            immobilism in the new assembly and eventually another breakdown in
                            parliament-palace relations. The representative character and power of
                            the legislature also appear crucial. If the deputies lack genuine
                            grassroots support and have no real power, they could seem to to the
                            Moroccan public like a band of self-serving sycophants. This lack of
                            confidence could be of critical importance, for even today Moroccans
                            under 30 years old, and comprising around two-thirds of the total
                            populace, tend to have little respect for either regime or parties.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MOROCCO: KENITRA AND THE KING</p>
                        <p>Since the evacuation of Wheelus airbase in June 1970, the sole American
                            military facilities remaining in the Arab world are in Morocco: the US
                            Navy Training Command at Kenitra and sensitive communications
                            installactions at nearby Bouknadel and Sidi Yahia. A king's word rather
                            than any written treaty guarantees their existence. In 1963, when the US
                            evacuated the military bases it had occupied in Morocco, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> orally assured President
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> that these facilities could remain
                            indefinitely; he repeated this oral assurance to President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> in 1967. Both sentimental and political
                            reasons appear to lie behind the King's commitment. This, however, may
                            increasingly be eroded by anti-US pressures and by his own excessive
                            efforts to utilize the existence of the bases as a lever for obtaining
                            greater US aid and support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Royal Sentiment.</hi> King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s personal feelings towards the
                            US cannot be accurately measured. We do know, however, that they go back
                            to a memorable boyhood experience: his presence at the 1943 meeting at
                            Casablanca between his father, Mohammed V and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RABJ1">Roosevelt</persName>. Since then, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has placed considerable value on
                            friendship with the US, probably reflecting a continuing sense of <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d107-02" facs="d107-02"/>personal gratitude to the
                            first major Western power that expressed favorable interest in Moroccan
                            independence. In addition, the king probably retains favorable memories
                            of his contacts with American personnel at Kenitra while he was Crown
                            Prince in the late 1950's: he, his brother, and sisters got to know
                            Americans there and learned to rely on US facilities for luxury goods
                            and on base officials for various personal and political services.</p>
                        <p>A Convenient Option. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            also developed important political reasons to cultivate the US. His
                            “American option” has become a means to many ends. On different
                            occasions he has been able to use the US as counterweight in various
                            dealings: with his domestic opposition, hostile neighbors (notably
                            Algeria), ex-colonial power France, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. His trip to Washington in 1963, for example, enabled
                            him to draw an implied US stamp of approval for the controversial
                            constitutional system he installed at that time. Similarly, he played up
                            Moroccan-US ties during the four-year period, 1965-69, when the French
                            withdrew their ambassador and suspended economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>From the outset <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> apparently
                            recognized that his US option, to be credible, required a continuing and
                            visible US interest in close relations with Morocco. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> probably appreciated the element
                            of disinterest in US diplomatic friendship for Morocco—in contrast to
                            the French whose designs he considered neo-colonialist—he also seemed to
                            have <pb n="3" xml:id="d107-03" facs="d107-03"/>realized it could well
                            lead to declining US attentiveness. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> therefore looked to the US military for support
                            and sought White House attention, skillfully trying to establish a
                            personal relationship with each new president.</p>
                        <p>To place his US insurance policy on a more secure basis, he assured
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> in 1963 that the Kenitra
                            facilities could remain. Three years later, he attempted to carry his
                            “special relationship” with the US a step farther. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s domestic problems in 1966 were
                            formidable; drought had caused a severe shortfall in farm production,
                            and the political parties were chafing under a state of emergency rule
                            imposed the previous year. Moreover, Morocco was at odds with its North
                            African neighbors as well as Spain and France, and the king was under
                            military pressure to counter the Algerian threat with an arms buildup.
                            In a deftly orchestrated campaign (including a visit to Moscow and
                            bilateral talks with the US at diplomatic, military, [text not
                            declassified]), <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> laid the
                            groundwork for his proposition in January 1967, that Morocco and the US
                            conclude a formal mutual security arrangement. His proposal met with
                            rebuff by US officials, but <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> nevertheless reassured President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>, during a visit to Washington in
                            February 1967, that the US could continue using the Kenitra
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>Advantages to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> Outweigh
                            Drawbacks. The arrangements on Kenitra have provided <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> with considerable leverage to
                            help ensure a continuing flow of US military aid and economic
                            assistance. It has enabled <pb n="4" xml:id="d107-04" facs="d107-04"
                            />him to prevent a gradual phase-down in US aid levels that had been
                            planned as a consequence of the 1963 evacuation. Instead he was able to
                            count on substantial US support in later years. Overall, through fiscal
                            year 1969, Morocco has received, since 1953, about $66.2 million under
                            the military assistance program and an additional $692.4 million in US
                            economic aid ($56.2 and $292.5 million, respectively, since <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963).</p>
                        <p>Over the past seven years, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            has thus parlayed the US stake in Kenitra into concrete political and
                            economic advantages for his regime. These benefits give <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, if anything, a greater stake
                            than Washington in a continued US military presence. Moreover, he has
                            thus far succeeded in neutralizing the political drawbacks in the
                            arrangements. Foreign criticism from radical Arab quarters, notably
                            Algeria during the June 1967 war, has not deterred him from maintaining
                            this apparent anachronism in the Arab world—nor has it barred him from
                            active participation in Arab councils and diplomatic campaigns. At home
                            he has been able to sidestep the potentially embarrassing question of
                            whether the US military facilities constitute an infringement of
                            Moroccan sovereignty. By placing Moroccan flags over the three
                            installations, Moroccan military insignia on the uniforms of US
                            personnel, and a sizeable Moroccan military presence at the Kenitra
                            base, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has been able to
                            marshal supporting evidence for his claim that the three bases are
                            legally—and genuinely—Moroccan. (Moroccan military and civilian
                            officials and, to a considerable extent, educated Moroccans in general,
                            are aware of the continuing US <pb n="5" xml:id="d107-05" facs="d107-05"
                            />military presence at these installations—although not the details of
                            their activities). Indeed, at a press conference in July <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> baldly asserted that even Soviet
                            party leader Brezhnev had acknowledged the bases to be Moroccan. His
                            credibility appears to remain intact even though the Moroccan opposition
                            press, echoing news despatches on the Symington sub-committee hearings,
                            has recently begun for the first time to question the US military
                            presence. His defense of the status quo serves to tie his past verbal
                            assurances even closer to his power and prestige.</p>

                        <p>Notwithstanding this royal support, the US military facilities in Morocco
                            face an uncertain future and may be increasingly subject to royal
                            pressure. The Moroccan monarch appears in a paradoxical situation. On
                            the one hand, his present determination to preserve the US presence
                            leaves him increasingly vulnerable to the tides of popular opinion.
                            Another rapid rise in Middle East tensions could compromise the US
                            facilities, and a renewed outbreak of Arab/Israeli hostilities almost
                            certainly would do so. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s uncompromising stance toward his domestic
                            opposition is likely to drive the political opposition, desperately
                            searching for ways to embarrass and harass the regime, to intensify its
                            attacks on the US presence. Moreover, organized labor is likely to join
                            the attack since the authorities on October 1 ordered the Moroccan
                            workers (over 750) employed at US facilities on the three installations
                            to disaffiliate from the country's largest trade union.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, the growing number of dissatisfactions Morocco finds
                            in its bilateral relations with the US, including the prospects of
                            declining American economic and military assistance, will probably cause
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> once again to attempt
                            to use the bases as leverage against the US. That the regime has thus
                            far permitted the opposition press to publish articles critical of
                            Kenitra—while Morocco seizes newspaper issues and arrests journalists
                            for articles on numerous other subjects—suggests that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> may already have opened such a
                            campaign. If the American response is unsatisfactory to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, he may well put additional
                            pressure on the US by increasing Moroccan controls over the bases.</p>

                        <p>You may have seen the telegram at Tab B reporting the King of Morocco's
                            desire to discuss the status of the U.S. communications facility at
                            Kenitra (Morocco) with a Presidential emissary.</p>
                        <p>As you know, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has a
                            distressing penchant for emissaries, but <pb n="2" xml:id="d109-02"
                                facs="d109-02"/>in this case he has more reason than usual. The
                            presence of our communications facilities—naval [text not
                            declassified]—is based only on an oral understanding between him and
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> in 1963. When our SAC bases there
                            were closed, these facilities stayed on under the Moroccan flag and
                            training activities for Moroccans are conducted there.</p>
                        <p>As a result of news stories coming out of the Symington Subcommittee,
                            this has again blown up as a public issue in Morocco. The King's
                            opposition has charged the King with allowing a U.S. “base” on Moroccan
                            soil. Disturbed by this, the King has asked for an emissary (a) to
                            review the implications of the continued existence of these bases and
                            (b) to assure him that they are indeed Communications facilities and not
                            operational bases.</p>
                        <p>The logical course of action would be: <list>
                                <item>—to complete our own review (underway) of the need for these
                                    facilities;</item>
                                <item>—to discuss our conclusions with the Moroccan technical
                                    level;</item>
                                <item>—to ratify new arrangements at the top.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> proposed this
                            procedure, but the King still feels he would like to see an
                            emissary.</p>
                        <p>In this case, I would be inclined to go along since there is one possible
                            emissary who would make a lot of sense. Robert Murphy not only has a
                            longstanding association with the King [text not declassified] One of
                            the issues here will be what price the U.S. will be prepared to pay
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in military assistance
                            (from a depleted African budget) in return for continuation at
                            Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>The telegram at Tab A, therefore, says we are prepared to send an
                            emissary in two or three weeks, as soon as the latest round of publicity
                            on the issue has died down.</p>
                        <p>While I would normally try to turn this off, I think we might as well
                            respond promptly and get this issue settled. Otherwise, this problem
                            will still be hanging around to confront the President when <persName

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>, who was
                            present at the meeting, sent in a report based on both is own and Mr.
                                <persName>Murphy</persName>'s observations which was sent to you at
                            the time. What it all boiled down to was the fact that the King wanted
                            more U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>To wind up his responsibilities, Mr. <persName>Murphy</persName> has sent
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> a fuller account
                            of the meeting with a copy of the letter designated for you [attached].
                            Murphy's report is basically in harmony with <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                                >Rockwell</persName>'s: <list>
                                <item>--Murphy shares with <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                                        >Rockwell</persName> the impression that the King is simply
                                    trying to exploit the situation to derive substantial material
                                    benefits from the U.S. He was told that “nominal and picayune
                                    items will no longer do.” However, Murphy also stressed that the
                                    atmosphere was entirely friendly and he does not believe the
                                    King intends to eject or threaten to eject the facilities. [As
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> had noted,
                                    the King indicated that he had no complexes about bases; he
                                    simply wanted to know “what President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wanted” in connection
                                    with them.]</item>
                                <item>--Murphy also concluded that the King has decided that this is
                                    a good time to bargain and that the negotiations ought to be
                                    kept at the Chief of State level.</item>
                                <item>--The King agreed that the Russians have been active in
                                    stimulating domestic opposition to the U.S. facilities,
                                    doubtless because of the ramifications they may have for the
                                    Soviet Mediterranean fleet. He indicated that he had been quite
                                    courageous in his talks with Brezhnev in Moscow. In that
                                    connection, <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>
                                    recalled the King's annoyance over the yearly negotiations for
                                        <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 wheat and other aid
                                    which were not felt to be commensurate with the difficulties
                                    occasioned by the U.S. military presence in Morocco; in the
                                    King's words, “if, however, the counterpart were sufficient,
                                    then I could look Brezhnev in the face.”</item>

                                <item>--Murphy was hopeful the King would be more specific as to his
                                    wants — he went only so far as to say he would send an emissary
                                    to Washington and, of course, discuss the matter with the
                                    President himself —- and the King was equally disappointed that
                                    Murphy had nothing substantial to say on the matter of
                                    “counterpart.”</item>
                                <item>--Murphy also came away with the impression that the hasty
                                    American departure from Wheelus came as somewhat of a surprise
                                    to the Moroccans.</item>

                                We probably cannot prevent his raising the subject with the
                                President because he remembers bargaining personally with President
                                    <persName>Kennedy</persName> for more aid in return for allowing
                                us to stay at Kenitra when our SAC bases closed in 1963.
                                Nevertheless, I have told State I did not think President <persName

                        </p>
                        <p>When the U.S. closed down its three Strategic Air Command bases in
                            Morocco in 1963, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            reached an oral agreement with President <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                            during a state visit in the spring of that year which permitted the U.S.
                            to stay on at its naval [text not declassified] communications
                            facilities at Kenitra. The base was transferred to Moroccan control, and
                            the US Navy established a communications training school for the
                            Moroccan military there. Also, the training program for the F-5 aircraft
                            which we sold to Morocco was located at that installation. In that same
                            talk with President <persName>Kennedy</persName>, certain levels of
                            economic and military assistance for the next couple of years were also
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The operation continued smoothly until last summer when there were leaks
                            from the Symington sub-committee's hearings on U.S. installations
                            abroad. Those newspaper stories were picked up in Morocco, and the
                            opposition party and press made a good thing of the idea that the U.S.
                            still had a “base” in Morocco. The Moroccan government handled the
                            problem reasonably well, saying that this was not a U.S. base and that
                            the main activity there was training Moroccans with some U.S.
                            communications on the side.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of that political flurry, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> last November said he wanted to
                            discuss with you how he could show his people that the continuation of
                            this relationship with the U.S. at Kenitra worked to their advantage.
                            Robert Murphy was asked to talk with the King about this. His assessment
                            was that the King did not wish to get rid of the U.S. installation but
                            was angling for more aid in return for it. Apparently he <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d112-02" facs="d112-02"/>remembered the arrangement he had
                            made directly with President <persName>Kennedy</persName> and had in
                            mind capitalizing on his forthcoming state visit to get something more
                            for the facility.</p>
                        <p>A complete intra-U.S. Government review has now taken place, and the Navy
                            [text not declassified] concluded that it would be helpful if our
                            facilities could remain in being as long as possible, although if
                            popular political pressure in Morocco mounted, we would withdraw and
                            duplicate their function as much as possible in Spain and elsewhere.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The present problem, therefore, is to explain to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> our requirements in relation to
                            the Kenitra facilities and our general programming for military and
                            economic assistance to Morocco. The purpose of the present exercise is
                            to get as much of this settled before he comes on his state visit at the
                            end of April, so that you will not have to do more than simply note that
                            a satisfactory understanding has been reached. This cannot be guaranteed
                            because the King has a notion that the way to do business on something
                            like this is between heads of state. But as much will be done as
                            possible to save you from anything more than a simple ratification of a
                            general understanding.</p>
                        <p>The line of action which has been proposed through the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> system is to instruct Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> to go to the King
                            and to make the following points in your name: <list>
                                <item>—The U.S. has appreciated its continued access to these
                                    facilities.</item>
                                <item>—The U.S. has not tied its assistance programs to Morocco to
                                    our continued access to the base. Our economic aid program (over
                                    $660 million through 1969) has been based on our estimates not
                                    only of Moroccan economic requirements but also our general
                                    friendly relationship with Morocco.</item>
                                <item>—The President wishes the King to know that, subject to
                                    Congressional appropriations, the U.S. will continue to assist
                                    Morocco in the future because of our continued interest in
                                    Morocco's legitimate security and development needs.</item>
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d112-03" facs="d112-03"/>
                                <item>—With regard to Kenitra, at any time His Majesty concludes
                                    that our presence there poses unacceptable political liabilities
                                    to him we would understand and would be prepared to discuss with
                                    his government altering our presence as appropriate. In fact,
                                    some changes are already being made. We hope that the Moroccan
                                    government will find a way of conveying to the Moroccan people a
                                    full understanding of the substantial U.S. economic and military
                                    assistance the U.S. has provided. Morocco is the largest African
                                    recipient of U.S. economic and military assistance since World
                                    War II.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> would also be
                            authorized, at his discretion, to review with the King our plans for
                            general economic and military assistance through <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1972. This would include $15 million in military credit
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 and again in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. This will require a Presidential
                            determination that it is important to U.S. interests to provide this
                            amount, but that has been included in your Budget. At the same time, the
                            Navy will make improvements at the installation, which will benefit the
                            Moroccans, which will total approximately $14 million and will expand
                            the telecommunications school for the Moroccan military.</p>
                        <p>The one issue in this approach is whether Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> should be authorized to speak
                            to the King about aid levels. The argument against doing so is that if
                            the King were to raise the subject here when he comes, you would not
                            have anything new to offer. However, it seems desirable to make some
                            effort to give the King fully what we have in mind and then tell him, in
                            the course of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                            >Rockwell</persName>'s presentation, that you hope this subject can be
                            laid aside so that other matters of common concern may be discussed
                            during the King's visit.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>In short, this is a holding action. We do not believe that the King
                            really wants us to leave. He wants a continuing association with the
                            U.S. He also wants as much military and economic assistance as he can
                            get from us. The amount that has been offered is as much as we can do
                            within the scope of our appropriations and what the Moroccans can
                            use.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> plan. Morocco has used
                            its influence to get the <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            plan accepted. Since then <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            has died. Many changes have occurred—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s death and various peace proposals. We have good
                            relations with the UAR and they check everything with us. We have kept
                            up the pressure to maintain the ceasefire but the present circumstances
                            are very delicate. His Majesty has asked that there be an urgent
                            convening of the Arab Summit. We want to bring the Arab World to
                            realism. Our objective is to get more realism into the outlook of the
                            Arabs. The planned meeting would coincide with the <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d113-02" facs="d113-02"/>visit of His Majesty to the U.S.
                            and it is obvious that his Majesty cannot absent himself from a Summit
                            he himself has called.</p>
                        <p>Last week His Majesty received emissaries from Hussein and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. We are the only Arabs who
                            are on good terms with all other Arabs. This has produced a series of
                            dilemmas for the King. Either to come but not speak at the National
                            Press Club and on Meet the Press, which is against his nature, or to
                            have the public appearances and thereby jeopardize the Summit. We
                            recognize that these trips are planned months ahead and therefore we
                            have two proposals to make. One, we could turn the visit into a private
                            one. His Majesty would arrive in the morning and leave in the evening.
                            Or, we could postpone the visit. Above all, His Majesty wants it to be
                            clear that nothing that is done will affect the bilateral relationship.
                            His Majesty leaves the decision up to the President.”</p>
                        <p>The President said, “I agree completely with the role of Morocco. Morocco
                            is the most stable and objective nation in the area. Secondly, we want
                            to enhance His Majesty's role and we will do whatever His Majesty wants.
                            If he came on a private visit he need not make any public speeches. On
                            the other hand, we want to give His Majesty the honor befitting his
                            station and that would suggest that a dinner would be better than a
                            lunch, so if he came on a private visit he should plan to stay
                            overnight. But we would like to work it out, whichever is more
                            convenient.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> said, “His Majesty has left
                            me the discussion of turning it into a private visit or postponement. I
                            believe that turning it <pb n="3" xml:id="d113-03" facs="d113-03"/>into
                            a private visit might appear to some that the best Arab friend of the
                            U.S. was being treated in a cavalier way, and a certain sector of the
                            press would exploit it. Therefore, let us postpone the visit until June
                            or October. If by then there has been an Arab Summit we will brief you
                            on it; if not, we will give you our view of the situation. It was
                            noticeable that now the Arab Summit seemed much less imminent.” There
                            was then some desultory conversation about possible dates, and the
                            meeting ended.</p>

                        <p>In its A-97 of May 19, the Embassy forwarded to the Department an
                            analysis by Mr. <persName>Edward Djerejian</persName>, the
                            Labor-Political Officer at Casablanca, recommending a reorientation of
                            U.S. policy in Morocco. Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> maintained
                            that we are over-committed to Morocco and that our real interest here is
                            in supporting an independent and democratic Morocco which will be able
                            to achieve the social and economic development which is the basis of
                            social justice. We made no comment on his analysis at that time but
                            promised one later. A group of substantive officers and I have since
                            discussed the report at some length with Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName> himself and the following represents
                            a distillation of our principal comments on the paper.</p>
                        <p>First of all, we all agree that Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> has
                            done a useful job in focusing our attention on important aspects of our
                            policy toward Morocco and of forcing us to reexamine some of the
                            fundamental concepts under which we have been operating. I think he is
                            to be commended for his imaginative and thoughtful analysis. We do not
                            agree with all of it but we think it is provocative and worth
                            discussing.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName>'s recommendations amount to, we
                            think, is that we dissociate ourselves from the regime and that we
                            encourage those elements which are by their nature opposed to <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d114-02" facs="d114-02"/>autocratic government in Morocco.
                            This assumes the existence of such elements and that they are likely
                            contenders for power. I do not know that such elements, having a
                            realistic possibility of attaining power, do in fact exist. All
                            observers seem to be agreed that the only likely force to mount a
                            revolution here is the Army, and I do not think we would find the Army
                            any less autocratic or more effective in promoting the social and
                            economic development of the country than is the present regime. Nor do I
                            think that lessening of our economic support to the regime would promote
                            the economic and social development of the country.</p>
                        <p>There are two fundamental assumptions of Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName>'s analysis which seem open to
                            question. One is that we are overcommitted here and the other is that
                            radical change is inevitable. We have had a long discussion about
                            whether or not we are overcommitted; I think we can all agree that our
                            present commitment is an inheritance from the past. Were we to arrive on
                            the scene today and were there no naval communications facilities here,
                            I doubt we would decide that Morocco should be the largest <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> recipient country in Africa. We would
                            probably put some of that money some place else. The point is, however,
                            that we are not arriving fresh on the scene and that to alter radically
                            the level of our bilateral aid to Morocco would inevitably affect our
                            relations with this government and would affect our tenure at Kenitra,
                            Sidi Yahya and Bouknadel. I personally do not feel that in the
                            circumstances we are overcommitted. While there may be some question
                            about the utilization of some of the aid we have given Morocco, I think
                            in general it has been well used and that our aid Mission is doing an
                            effective job of stimulating the Moroccan government into rational
                            change. We are getting value for our money in terms of our tenure at
                            Kenitra and the other installations, and I understand that those
                            installations are in fact of great value to our military forces.</p>
                        <p>We also find it difficult to accept the thesis that radical change here
                            is inevitable. One can compare the population and unemployment figures
                            with the pace of economic development and look at the examples set by
                            other Arab countries and conclude that radical change within the next 10
                            years is possible, or even likely, but one should not conclude that it
                            is inevitable.</p>
                        <p>We hold no brief for King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            but we do not think one should sell him short. A great deal of money and
                            effort has gone into the building of <pb n="3" xml:id="d114-03"
                                facs="d114-03"/>infrastructure in this country, and they are on the
                            eve of paying off—structures like the new dams on the lower Moulouya and
                            the Ziz Rivers are only now beginning to perform their planned
                            functions. An era of agricultural development is opening up which may
                            change many of our basic assumptions. It certainly is in our interests
                            that these efforts come to fruition, that Morocco continue to enjoy
                            stability and a reasonable degree of freedom and that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> succeed in bringing this country
                            through its transition from a traditional to a modern state by peaceful
                            means. We may not approve totally of the way he is doing it, but our
                            experiences with the Shah of Iran show that we are not always right
                            about such things.</p>
                        <p>We fully agree with Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> that we should do
                            what we can to urge the regime to increase popular participation in the
                            development effort and to make better utilization of its human
                            resources. Our leverage in this regard should not be overestimated,
                            however, and a constant harping on this theme is likely to reduce our
                            effectiveness. We also agree that we should not associate ourselves with
                            the repressive political aspects of the regime and will do our best to
                            avoid doing so, We doubt, however, that we could do much to change the
                            regime's attitude or tactics towards the radical opposition, nor are we
                            sure it would be wise to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> recommended that we undertake an
                            intensive informational and cultural effort to communicate and cultivate
                            Moroccan youth and potential leaders. We are already carrying out a
                            fairly active program in this regard, principally through <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, and there are built-in limitations
                            as to how far we can go because of the regime's desire to control
                            contacts between foreigners and Moroccans. Our new Embassy Youth
                            Committee is at the moment considering possibilities for new approaches

                        <p>In its A-97 of May 19, the Embassy forwarded to the Department an
                            analysis by Mr. <persName>Edward Djerejian</persName>, the
                            Labor-Political Officer at Casablanca, recommending a reorientation of
                            U.S. policy in Morocco. Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> maintained
                            that we are over-committed to Morocco and that our real interest here is
                            in supporting an independent and democratic Morocco which will be able
                            to achieve the social and economic development which is the basis of
                            social justice. We made no comment on his analysis at that time but
                            promised one later. A group of substantive officers and I have since
                            discussed the report at some length with Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName> himself and the following represents
                            a distillation of our principal comments on the paper.</p>
                        <p>First of all, we all agree that Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> has
                            done a useful job in focusing our attention on important aspects of our
                            policy toward Morocco and of forcing us to reexamine some of the
                            fundamental concepts under which we have been operating. I think he is
                            to be commended for his imaginative and thoughtful analysis. We do not
                            agree with all of it but we think it is provocative and worth
                            discussing.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName>'s recommendations amount to, we
                            think, is that we dissociate ourselves from the regime and that we
                            encourage those elements which are by their nature opposed to autocratic
                            government in Morocco. This assumes the existence of such elements and
                            that they are likely contenders for power. I do not know that such
                            elements, having a realistic possibility of attaining power, do in fact
                            exist. All observers seem to be agreed that the only likely force to
                            mount a revolution here is the Army, and I do not think we would find
                            the Army any less autocratic or more effective in promoting the social
                            and economic development of the country than is the present regime. Nor
                            do I think that lessening of our economic support to the regime would
                            promote the economic and social development of the country.</p>
                        <p>There are two fundamental assumptions of Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName>'s analysis which seem open to
                            question. One is that we are overcommitted here and the other is that
                            radical change is inevitable. We have had a long discussion about
                            whether or not we are overcommitted; I think we can all agree that our
                            present commitment is an inheritance from the past. Were we to arrive on
                            the scene today and were there no naval communications facilities here,
                            I doubt we would decide that Morocco should be the largest AID recipient
                            country in Africa. We would probably put some of that money some place
                            else. The point is, however, that we are not arriving fresh on the scene
                            and that to alter radically the level of our bilateral aid to Morocco
                            would inevitably affect our relations with this government and would
                            affect our tenure at Kenitra, Sidi Yahya and Bouknadel. I personally do
                            not feel that in the circumstances we are overcommitted. While there may
                            be some question about the utilization of some of the aid we have given
                            Morocco, I think in general it has been well used and that our aid
                            Mission is doing an effective job of stimulating the Moroccan government
                            into rational change. We are getting value for our money in terms of our
                            tenure at Kenitra and the other installations, and I understand that
                            those installations are in fact of great value to our military
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>We also find it difficult to accept the thesis that radical change here
                            is inevitable. One can compare the population and unemployment figures
                            with the pace of economic development and look at the examples set by
                            other Arab countries and conclude that radical change within the next 10
                            years is possible, or even likely, but one should not conclude that it
                            is inevitable. We hold no brief for King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> but we do not think one should sell him short. A
                            great deal of money and effort has gone into the building of
                            infrastructure in this country, and they are on the eve of paying
                            off—structures like the new dams on the lower Moulouya and the Ziz
                            Rivers are only now beginning to perform their planned functions. An era
                            of agricultural development is opening up which may change many of our
                            basic assumptions. It certainly is in our interests that these efforts
                            come to fruition, that Morocco continue to enjoy stability and a
                            reasonable degree of freedom and that King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> succeed in bringing this country through its
                            transition from a traditional to a modern state by peaceful means. We
                            may not approve totally of the way he is doing it, but our experiences
                            with the Shah of Iran show that we are not always right about such
                            things.</p>
                        <p>We fully agree with Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> that we should do
                            what we can to urge the regime to increase popular participation in the
                            development effort and to make better utilization of its human
                            resources. Our leverage in this regard should not be overestimated,
                            however, and a constant harping on this theme is likely to reduce our
                            effectiveness. We also agree that we should not associate ourselves with
                            the repressive political aspects of the regime and will do our best to
                            avoid doing so, We doubt, however, that we could do much to change the
                            regime's attitude or tactics towards the radical opposition, nor are we
                            sure it would be wise to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> recommended that we undertake an
                            intensive informational and cultural effort to communicate and cultivate
                            Moroccan youth and potential leaders. We are already carrying out a
                            fairly active program in this regard, principally through <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, and there are built-in limitations
                            as to how far we can go because of the regime's desire to control
                            contacts between foreigners and Moroccans. Our new Embassy Youth
                            Committee is at the moment considering possibilities for new approaches
                            in this field and it may be that we will decide to reexamine or retread
                            some of our present programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> also recommended that we expand our
                            contacts with representative social and political groups such as the
                            trade union movement. From discussion with Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName> we have learned that he has in mind
                            more the question of contacts between diplomatic representatives here
                            and labor leaders in Casablanca, for example. We have no problem with
                            this and will try to improve our track record.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d114-04" facs="d114-04"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> recommends expanding unilateral and
                            multilateral assistance and eliminating bilateral assistance except for
                            Promotion Nationale, Peace Corps and unilateral programs. We have also
                            discussed this at some length and believe we have convinced Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName> that in terms of his stated goal of
                            promoting the economic and social development of Morocco, we have
                            greater influence through a bilateral program than we would have if we
                            relied entirely on multilateral efforts, even assuming the latter was
                            possible under aid legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> recommends reducing military
                            assistance levels, but his recommendation seems to have been based upon
                            a misunderstanding as to the nature and level of our assistance. Our
                            program today consists of about $1 million grant aid and $10 million in
                            credit sales each year. This is already a very modest program and in the
                            present circumstances we think it is the minimum we can do and still
                            make any effective contribution to the Moroccan defense capability. We
                            think Morocco does need a defense capability and that it is in our
                            interests to help develop it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName>Djerejian</persName> recommends timely withdrawal
                            from our installations at Kenitra, Sidi Yahya and Bouknadel if they are
                            no longer in our strategic interests. We fully agree, but we believe
                            that those installations are in fact in our strategic interests at
                            present. Or rather, this is what we have been given to understand by
                            Washington and we are in no position to judge otherwise.</p>
                        <p>This discussion calls to mind the fact that we still have no national
                            policy paper for Morocco. We are aware of the problems with NSSM 87 but
                            it seems to us that a thoroughgoing discussion of what our interests are
                            and what we should be doing about them is still in order. If it does no
                            more than highlight the need for such a discussion, Mr.
                                <persName>Djerejian</persName>'s paper will have served a useful
                            purpose.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Although Morocco has distinctively North African characteristics and
                                is a part of the “Arab” (or at any rate, Islamic world), geography
                                and the economics of location have given it a very strong North and
                                West orientation. It is a key strategic land mass at the Atlantic
                                end of the Mediterranean, with old cultural and commercial ties with
                                Spain and France.</p>
                            <p>Historically, the prime American interest in Morocco has been to keep
                                it and its adjacent waters free from influences that might be
                                detrimental to the free flow of commerce and navigation. This is
                                still a major concern. Since World War II, however, we have had a
                                more specific strategic interest in the country, reflected in the
                                1950's by SAC bases and now by the Kenitra Naval Communications
                                Station. Over the years we have developed something resembling a
                                “special relationship” with the Moroccan Government. This
                                relationship has not only been significant in the bilateral sense,
                                it has helped provide on occasion a bridge of understanding and
                                comprehension to other Arab states.</p>
                            <p>Our commercial relations with Morocco are still relatively modest. As
                                the country develops, however, we would hope that the technical and
                                financial aid we have provided over the years, would give American
                                business a valuable entree.</p>

                        <p>The following is the situation in Morocco based on the most recent
                            reports available: <list>
                                <item>—A disaffected group of Moroccan military apparently led by
                                    three Army Brigadiers, Military Region Commander, and a Lt.
                                    Colonel, who commands the Non-Commissioned Officers School,
                                    today attempted a coup against <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                        >Hassan</persName>. The attack was made on the Royal Palace
                                    near Rabat where the King was hosting a large group of diplomats
                                    and notables in celebration of his 42nd birthday.</item>
                                <item>—The affair at the Palace was bloody but the King was not
                                    harmed. The Belgium Ambassador and several other important
                                    figures apparently were killed. The King's brother reportedly is
                                    seriously wounded.</item>
                                <item>—We have no reports on Americans being harmed although
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> and
                                    other Americans were present at the King's celebration.</item>
                                <item>—The King still is in control of the situation and has given
                                    full military and civilian powers to Interior Minister, General
                                        <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>.</item>
                                <item>—The King is expected shortly to broadcast an appeal over
                                    Moroccan radio to the people and the Armed Forces.</item>
                                <item>—The King and the Queen are reportedly aboard a Moroccan Naval
                                    vessel off the coast.</item>
                                <item>—At this time order seems to be returning and the coup attempt
                                    apparently has failed.</item>

                                >Hassan</persName> II of Morocco apparently has failed, although
                            some sporadic fighting continues and some of the rebels are still to be
                            rounded up.</p>
                        <p>The latest reporting from our Embassy indicates that the situation seems
                            to be normal everywhere in the country except Rabat. There is still,
                            however, occasional firing in the downtown area of the capital city,
                            particularly around the radio station and near army headquarters. The
                            Royal Palace apparently is still in rebel hands. All known principals of

                            is unharmed and, after initially putting out to sea, he has returned to
                            a small palace that he maintains outside of Rabat. In a radio statement,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> said Morocco had
                            passed through the most serious crisis in its history and declared the
                            army remains loyal.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Interior General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >Oufkir</persName> has been given full military and civilian powers
                            to restore order and clean out the rebels and, for all practical
                            purposes, is the man actually running the country at this moment. He is
                            a very tough, well-seasoned and controversial figure characterized in
                            the past by both his loyalty to the King and harshness in suppressing
                            opposition. If he bails out Hassan this time, <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> can be expected to play a very
                            influential role in the future. He is reported to be well disposed to
                            the U. S. and the West but as a pragmatist he is capable of being
                            accommodating to the Soviets if he thought this were in Morocco's
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans reportedly have placed their armed forces on alert and have
                            proclaimed their support for the rebels. The King reacted to this
                            announcement with utter contempt. It is doubtful at this point that the
                            Libyans will <pb n="2" xml:id="d117-02" facs="d117-02"/>go beyond
                            propaganda and perhaps threats. The Algerians have not committed
                            themselves one way or the other and seem to be lying low. So far no
                            other government in the area has taken any public position.</p>

                            >Hassan</persName>, HIS ARMY, AND HIS FUTURE</p>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The near-miss coup attempt of July 10 in Morocco—which resulted in a
                            savage internecine army bloodbath—is now effectively quelled. The full
                            details of the military conspiracy and of what actually transpired at
                            the tragic birthday party remain yet to be clarified, but the events of
                            July add up to a major turning point in the reign of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. His relationship to the army
                            has changed significantly and, although presently secure, he seems in
                            greater eventual jeopardy than ever before from basic military and
                            civilian discontent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Army's Loyalty Shattered</hi>—The senior military
                            leadership, split between rebels and loyalists, is severely decimated.
                            Nine of the country's 16 generals are known to have been killed or
                            executed thus far, and numerous colonels, majors, and lower-ranking
                            officers have died. But the prime casualty was the idea that the army
                            gave monolithic and unconditional loyalty to the monarch. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, founder and commander-in-chief
                            of the Royal Armed Forces, had assiduously cultivated the myth and
                            almost certainly regarded the military as indispensable. The coup
                            attempt has cast doubt on the military establishment. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> understandably has publicly
                            maintained that the army remains “pure and honest”, his top surviving
                            military supporters, <pb n="2" xml:id="d118-02" facs="d118-02"/>Generals
                            Mohamed Oufkir and Driss Ben Aomar, are leading a hunt for those in the
                            army allied to or sympathetic toward the conspirators. Presumably, a
                            thorough-going purge of the officer corps—which may have been much more
                            broadly implicated in the coup affair than is presently known—will
                            ensue. Even so, the army probably cannot be put together again as a
                            wholly loyal instrument of royal will. The wholesale slaughter of
                            brother officers could well set in motion deep-seated resentments and
                            blood revenge motives within the clannish Berbers, who make up most of
                            the senior officer corps. And the vacancies in higher ranks raise the
                            inevitable prospect of promotion into command responsibilities for the
                            better-educated younger generation of middle-grade officers, a group
                            whose ultimate reliability thus far is open to question.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Growing Military Influence?</hi> While the specific
                            grievances that triggered the army officers' revolt remain unclear,
                            substantial military dissatisfaction on several scores has been evident
                            over the past year. The King's decision to restore constitutional
                            government and parliament in the summer of 1970 (after five years of
                            emergency rule in which the military and security forces had a largely
                            unfettered hand) was not popular in military ranks even though army
                            officers were given a role in managing the elections. Of probably
                            greater significance was military unhappiness over blatant corruption
                            and <pb n="3" xml:id="d118-03" facs="d118-03"/>favoritism among high
                            civilian ministers and officials—not that all the military were immune.
                            A corruption scandal in April sullied the regime's reputation, led the
                            King to postpone his visit to the US, and obliged him to dismiss four
                            ministers and other lesser officials. The military were also displeased
                            over the King's Algerian policy which, in the eyes of nationalist army
                            officers, appeared to amount to virtual capitulation on Morocco's
                            long-standing border claims.</p>
                        <p>The loyalist military leaders, on whom the King is dependent to a greater
                            degree than ever before, have an innate antipathy toward the existing
                            political system, viewing parties as basically demagogic and civilian
                            officials as venal and ineffective. To rally morale in the military,
                            they will almost certainly request—and receive in the coming
                            months—accelerated promotions and increased arms of impressive
                            proportions. Moreover, they are likely to exploit their present
                            bargaining position to press for a more efficient, perhaps military-led,
                            government and for policies with popular appeal and more nationalist
                            content. They may press the King to seek revisions in the US military
                            presence at Kenitra if not satisfied with American responsiveness to
                            present and likely additional requests for arms.</p>

                                Restoring a Political Balance.</hi> To a considerable extent, King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is himself responsible
                            for his present predicament: over-reliance on his military
                            establishment. His consummate success over 11 years of rule in
                            progressively concentrating <pb n="4" xml:id="d118-04" facs="d118-04"
                            />virtually all effective powers in his hands destroyed the balance of
                            political forces on which the monarchy rested when he acceded to the
                            throne in 1961. Political parties, trade unions, and other civilian
                            political forces eroded into near impotence, leaving the King virtually
                            alone with the military. By relying heavily on the security forces to
                            repress popular discontent, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> contained potential trouble but deepened
                            resentment against the regime. And by disregarding the military
                            officers' dissatisfactions over policy and the course of domestic
                            events, the King became increasingly vulnerable to the kind of military
                            reaction that occurred on July 10. Even though he has mustered
                            sufficient army support to overcome that challenge, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s existing relationship with the
                            military leaves him basically vulnerable. He may attempt to neutralize
                            the military, seeking even more than in the past to play against one
                            another various army units as well as the security police, gendarmerie,
                            and auxiliary forces. But he is unlikely willingly to alter his
                            autocratic style of rule or allow civilian political groups to develop
                            into a significant opposing force. As a consequence, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s throne appears in greater
                            jeopardy over the longer term than ever before.</p>

                                APRIL 6, 1971) THAT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE HARD TO FIX. IT HAS CERTAINLY

                                CORRUPTION IS A POPULAR ISSUE, HOWEVER, AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A

                                THAT HE IS THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO RULE, AND THAT HIS DAYS ARE

                                THERE WERE NO DECLARATIONS ABOUT CORRUPT RULE AND NO CALL FOR THE

                                MAY REMAIN, BUT CAN BE BETTER CONTROLLED IF HE HAS SOME INSTITUTIONS
                                OTHER THAN STATE SECURITY APPARATUS ON WHICH HE CAN DEPEND FOR
                                SUPPORT. HE WILL HAVE TO SHOW FAR MORE VIGOR AND DEDICATION TO
                                RUNNING COUNTRY THAN HE HAS TO DATE, HOWEVER, HE MIGHT TAKE CLUE
                                FROM HIS SHARIFIS, COUSIN, KING HUSSEIN, PUT DOWN HIS GOLF CLUB,
                                FOREGO HIS CONCUBINES, AND ROLL UP HIS SLEEVES. HE WOULD DO EVEN
                                BETTER TO EMULATE IRAN'S SHAH AND PROCLAIM AND PURSUE HIS OWN WHITE
                                REVOLUTION. WHATEVER HE DOES, KING MUST REALIZE HE IS IN DESPERATE
                                COMPETITION WITH SERIOUS COUNTERCLAIMANTS FOR POWER. HE WILL HAVE TO

                        <p>The Secretary welcomed the Prime Minister to Washington. He expressed
                            great pleasure in meeting the Prime Minister for the first time and
                            congratulated him on his new assignment. We were pleased, he said, that
                            things were more stable in Morocco now. The Secretary said he looked
                            back upon his visit to Morocco with great pleasure. It was a visit
                            neither Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> nor he would
                            ever forget.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary and conveyed to him His
                            Majesty's personal greetings. In Morocco, the Prime Minister said, His
                            Majesty and the Moroccan Government have warm recollections of the
                            Secretary's visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were very distressed by the recent
                            difficulties in Morocco. The President, who considered the King a close
                            friend, spoke of him often and had been very worried, and then relieved.
                            We were happy also that the Vice President's visit had gone so well.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had come to Washington primarily to
                            attend the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> meetings, he being also Minister of Finance, but he
                            had sought this occasion to inform the Secretary personally of the
                            evolution of the situation in Morocco. The events of July 10 had taken
                            them all by surprise. The attempted coup had not been based on any
                            doctrinal or political motives. It had not involved any open or
                            clandestine political organization, nor had it been based on any
                            particular ideology. It had been organized by a few high ranking
                            officers who used their power and influence to take over a school for
                            non-commissioned officers and to stage this abominable action. It had
                            been aimed at everyone, right and left, political parties included, and
                            His Majesty himself. What they would have done subsequently had they
                            succeeded has never been determined but the savagery of their attack did
                            not bode well for the future.</p>
                        <p>Karim-Lamrani said that world press reports had been of serious concern
                            to Morocco. Today one should not say that all was for the best in the
                            best of all possible worlds in Morocco. A great deal of rethinking had
                            to take place regarding the institutions of the state, its economic and
                            financial structure and everything affecting the education, training and
                            employment of the Moroccan man himself. Such is the difficult mandate,
                            the Prime Minister said, which had been given his government. In record
                            time it had the task of straightening out a number of problems in
                            different areas. Its work would be aimed primarily at that large segment
                            of the Moroccan population constituting the “have nots”.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized that it was up to the Moroccans to
                            reorganize themselves, plan their programs, and generate their own
                            material and human requirements. They would need, however, the
                            understanding and help of their friends to achieve even the minimum
                            required. With renewed vigor and earnestness they could reach these
                            goals rapidly, but the popular consensus must continue to support the
                            monarchy and the person of the King. After 13 centuries of monarchy,
                            Morocco is not prepared to accept an overnight change. The Monarchy
                            remains the basis on which necessary programs must be established.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d122-03" facs="d122-03"/>
                        <p>If Moroccans themselves are concerned to bring about a restoration of
                            serenity in Morocco, the Prime Minister went on, the free world must
                            feel the same way. Because of the political and strategic importance of
                            Morocco, of which the United States is well aware, whatever happens in
                            Morocco is bound to have international importance.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Prime Minister said he wished to stress that Morocco
                            had gone to work. It needed understanding, however, and also help to
                            carry out its vast program of economic development. The Prime Minister
                            said he was making his first trip as Prime Minister to Washington
                            because he looked upon the United States as the prime partner of Morocco
                            and the country most capable of understanding Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation for and concurrence in the Prime
                            Minister's remarks. The United States, the Secretary said, attaches
                            great importance to its friendship and close relations with Morocco and
                            shares the Prime Minister's assessment of Morocco's strategic position.
                            The Secretary assured the Prime Minister that the United States would
                            give careful and sympathetic consideration to specific proposals Morocco
                            might wish to make. We feel that relations between our two countries are
                            very good. We want them to remain very good. We are pleased at the
                            approach taken by Morocco in promoting social and economic development
                            which is so essential in the long run to insure the stability of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the problems mentioned by the Prime Minister as facing
                            Morocco, the Secretary said, there was the shortage of natural
                            resources. He said he hoped that Morocco would soon find oil. A second
                            problem, the Secretary continued, derived from the fact that in our
                            modern world the institutions of monarchy were looked upon by some as
                            being anachronistic.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d122-04" facs="d122-04"/>
                        <p>The programs outlined by the Prime Minister were therefore going in the
                            right direction, the Secretary said. They centered upon improving the
                            situation of the people and would give the monarchy greater visibility,
                            thereby compensating for one of the problems of a king. The Secretary
                            noted that the King enjoyed great respect in Morocco as well as
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that the natural resource experts of today
                            were convinced that oil would be found in Morocco. Moreover, the
                            government was developing the mining sector and the agricultural sector.
                            The areas served by new irrigation dams were under development and
                            agrarian reforms were being implemented.</p>
                        <p>As to the compatibility between the Monarchy as an institution and our
                            modern world, the Prime Minister said, whether a nation was a republic
                            or a kingdom, in itself, meant little--what mattered was what was in it.
                            Some monarchies were very democratic as in northern Europe. Some
                            republics were fascist, not to cite any by name, but the socialist
                            republics came to mind. What gave value to a system was the nature of
                            the man leading it. Morocco was fortunate to have a king who was young
                            and modern and close to his people. The Prime Minister concluded that
                            the King must draw even closer to his people. His Majesty needed to be
                            closer to the population at all levels in day to day acts as well as the
                            acts of statesmanship. What mattered most of all was that the steps
                            taken and measures announced be carried out in a healthy climate and
                            with a serious attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, in conclusion, pointed out that he was no
                            professional politician. He had not sought to be Prime Minister. The job
                            had been thrust upon him. This gave him the right, he said, to impose
                            certain conditions without which no governmental program could be
                            implemented.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation for this opportunity to meet the
                            Prime Minister and to have a frank discussion with him. He stressed the
                            respect His Majesty enjoys in the <pb n="5" xml:id="d122-05"
                                facs="d122-05"/>United States, and specifically referred to
                            President Eisenhower's and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s high regard for the King.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was pleased to see that the Government of Morocco
                            was concerning itself with modernizing the monarchy. Our administration,
                            he said, did not feel that it could give advice to countries about their
                            internal affairs; there had been too much of that in the past. Each
                            country must be guided by its own past and tradition. We want the Prime
                            Minister to know, the Secretary concluded, that the United States fully
                            supports the Moroccan monarchy and its King, and we want to be as
                            helpful to Morocco as we can.</p>

                                in Morocco deriving from its geographic location. Consequently we
                                wish Morocco to maintain its defensive capability and internal
                                security. Future Moroccan support in Law of the Sea negotiations for
                                free transit through Straits of Gibraltar would be desirable.
                                However, limitations on our resources, desirability of U.S. not

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good Afternoon, Your
                            Majesty. I have disturbed you this afternoon to present to you my views
                            on a subject that I consider to be of the greatest importance, the vote
                            in the United Nations on Chinese representation, which will occur on
                            Tuesday. As you know, since we had the opportunity to meet in 1957, I
                            have always had the very greatest respect for you and also for the
                            independence and integrity of your country. And because I cherish our
                            personal relationship, I want to speak to you in the frankest terms
                            about this important issue. It is my conviction that the removal of an
                            honorable member of the United Nations by a simple majority vote would
                            be a precedent of the most disastrous consequences. It could have the
                            most serious implications for the future survival of this organization.
                            And for this reason, I would ask you to consider voting with the United
                            States in favor of making the issue of expelling the government of
                            Taiwan an “important question” and at the same time to support the
                            position in establishing this matter as one of priority during Tuesday's
                            deliberation. I believe this is in the interest of the United Nations in
                            the future, because if any member can be expelled at any time by a
                            simple majority vote, this could unravel the organization in years to
                            come. And if if you could find it possible to vote with the United
                            States on this issue alone, that is of the “important question,” I would
                            consider it a very great personal favor. And I look forward, Your
                            Majesty, to our meeting again at some time. I know we have planned it,
                            but events have intervened, and I — Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and I look forward to welcoming Your Majesty at a

                            looked into this matter of China. I know that it is a highly delicate

                                >Rockwell</persName>. And it was my intention to look into this
                            matter again this afternoon with my government. I want you to tell the
                            President that I fully understand the concern of the United States. I
                            want you to tell the President that I am deeply touched that he has
                            called me personally. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>:

                            want you to convey to the President my wishes for his personal happiness
                            and prosperity, and I will not fail to send you a message regarding our

                            <item>Morocco is a poor country with a medieval monarchy facing growing
                                pressures for political, economic, and social change. King <persName

                                overthrown in a military uprising in July 1971, has learned little
                                from his narrow escape. He still believes that he can continue to
                                rule in the style of an oriental potentate. This virtually assures
                                that other challenges to the King will take place, but <persName

                                not guarantee a decrease in political tension. Indeed, there is no

                            <item>Morocco is a basically conservative and traditional state in which
                                there are increasingly ominous rumblings of change. Its uneven
                                exposure to European ideas and ways has left it a mixture of the
                                traditional and the contemporary. Since the end of the French and
                                Spanish Protectorates in 1956, it has made little progress in
                                developing modern political, economic, and social institutions. The
                                legacy of the French policy of divide and rule, accentuating the
                                differences between the Berbers of the mountains and the Arabized
                                population of the towns and lowlands, has played its part.<note
                                    n="*" xml:id="d125fn4">The Moroccan population is overwhelmingly
                                    Berber in origin, and the majority of those who now call
                                    themselves Arabs are really Arabized Berbers. Those who are
                                    termed Berbers—roughly 25 percent of the population—are so
                                    called because of their adherence to Berber speech and
                                    folkways.</note> But even more significant have been the effects
                                of the sharply segmented, still partly feudal, Moroccan social
                                system in which power and authority are widely diffused among
                                competing individuals and factions. Though the tribal structure has
                                weakened among the Arabized population, the traditional system still
                                strongly influences political alignments and discourages the rise of
                                effective national parties. Only the monarchy provides cohesion,
                                combining as it does both political and religious authority and
                                attracting the loyalty of both Arab and Berber.</item>

                            <item>The Moroccan system, despite its conservative character, has
                                elements of flexibility and resilience. It is based on personal
                                relationships and loyalties rather than on law. And serious
                                confrontation is avoided by opening back doors when the front doors
                                close. It is ruled by and for a small Arabized elite around King

                                including the royal family and hangers-on at court. Within broad
                                limits this is considered normal by most Moroccans, and the small
                                politically conscious minority of the population becomes concerned
                                only if corruption and personal influence exceed customary bounds.
                                Many in this minority also become concerned when the King shows
                                signs of losing control. It is precisely for these reasons that

                            <item>This whole structure was nearly toppled in July 1971 by a military
                                uprising. At that time, a nucleus of middle grade officers, joined
                                by some of the senior generals, seized and held the King briefly.
                                Their coup quickly collapsed because of failures in planning and
                                leadership, disunity among the conspirators, loyalty to the King in
                                the armed forces, and bad luck. The alleged conspirators were
                                promptly put to death—which may serve as a deterrent to future
                                attempts or may merely cause future conspirators to plan more
                                carefully. But the attempt indicated that pressures for change were
                                mounting, and it called into question the durability of the
                                traditional system in Morocco.</item>

                                consolidated the royal power. Since acceding to the throne in 1961,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has gone even
                                further than his father in asserting the supremacy of the monarchy.
                                When bloody riots broke out in Casablanca in 1965, he prorogued
                                parliament and virtually suspended political activity. But after
                                five years of a “state of exception,” he felt it expedient to
                                regularize the regime. He drew up a constitution in 1970, confirming
                                royal authority over all facets of the government and providing some
                                illusion of popular participation in government.</item>

                                reduced the influence of civilian politicians. On the one hand he
                                has attempted to prevent the formation of groups powerful enough to
                                threaten his position, and on the other has made skillful use of
                                patronage and the desire for office that animates Moroccan
                                politicians in general. He has made office the gateway to riches,
                                not political power, and his pandering to the acquisitiveness of the
                                elite has aggravated the problem of corruption. Another source of
                                discontent is his luxurious style of living which is considered
                                inappropriate by both traditionalists and modernists.</item>

                                concession. Thus soon after the suppression of the attempted
                                military coup of last July he acknowledged the need for popular
                                participation in the governing process. This stance, however, has
                                turned out to have been mainly a device to buy time. In his
                                subsequent dealings with the politicians—consulting, but in the end
                                facing them with faits accompli—<persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >Hassan</persName> has clearly demonstrated that he does not
                                want to share power nor to act as a constitutional monarch. His
                                actions over the past 10 months lead us to judge that he believes it
                                possible to continue the traditional system of royal rule without
                                meaningful concessions to the political parties.</item>

                                preoccupation with the pursuit of pleasure. His expenditures of time
                                and money on golf are legendary in Morocco as are the pomp and
                                circumstance of royal travel. Moreover, he is autocratic and not

                                The shock of his near deposition last July seems only to have
                                accentuated this tendency. In short, he appears to have learned

                                Protectorates in 1956, but the political parties today lack the
                                strength to force the King to deal with them. In part, their
                                weakness stems from the inability of the politicians to pull
                                together. After independence this factionalism led the left wing of
                                the Istiqlal to split off to form the National Union of Popular
                                Forces (UNFP). Other minor groupings also arose, including the
                                Popular Movement, which was inspired by the Palace as a
                                counterweight to the Istiqlal and has cooperated closely with the
                                monarchy. Thanks to this disunity and rivalry, the civilian
                                politicians found themselves unable to contest the assumption of
                                supreme power by the monarch. The party leaders never effectively
                                controlled the Cabinet, even during the first few years after
                                independence when they were nominally part of the governmental
                                coalition. And their organizations have been further weakened,
                                demoralized, and disrupted by their exclusion from normal political
                                activity since 1965.</item>

                            <item>The party leaders themselves have contributed to the growth of
                                factionalism. The head of the more conservative Istiqlal Party,
                                Allal al-Fassi, a traditional Arab leader from the city of Fez, has
                                been willing to engage in private discussions with the King and with
                                leaders of other parties, but he is rigidly insistent that his party
                                should have the dominant position. His generally uncompromising
                                stand and elitist approach have undermined cooperative efforts among
                                the politicians. He has just suffered a heart attack and may have to
                                curtail his activity. This may make him all the less willing to see
                                his political rivals in the UNFP play a major role in directing
                                opposition to the King.</item>

                            <item>The UNFP leaders, Abderrahim Bouabid and Abdallah Ibrahim, are
                                somewhat more flexible in their approach. Despite their differences
                                with the Istiqlal and the rather imperious al-Fassi, they agreed in
                                1970 to patch together a so-called National Front of the two parties
                                in order better to face the King with the appearance of unity. This
                                effort has not been very successful. The rival parties continue to
                                pull in different directions in their negotiations with the King.
                                And even though the UNFP views the monarchy as basically a medieval
                                institution which should be stripped of its dominant power, the
                                party's leaders in talks with the King have been more conciliatory
                                than their counterparts in the Istiqlal. Recognizing their party's
                                weakness, Bouabid and <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Ibrahim</persName>

                            <item>The troubles of the parties also stem from their limited
                                constituencies and poor image. Neither party has a mass base or a
                                nation-wide following. In the 1963 elections the Istiqlal got about
                                30 and the UNFP about 22 percent of the vote; their popular backing
                                has no doubt decreased in the interim. The Istiqlal appeals to the
                                traditional Arab mercantile and land-owning elite, particularly
                                around Fez, though it also has some support from Arabized elements
                                in rural areas. The UNFP is basically an urban party, backed by <pb

                            <item>The 60,000-man military establishment is both the chief prop of
                                and potential threat to the crown. In fact, the cadets who took part
                                in the July uprising thought that they were protecting the King.
                                Particularly since a number of officers of questionable loyalty were
                                killed or removed as a result of the coup attempt, the remaining
                                senior officers are generally conservative and monarchist in
                                outlook. We know little about the attitudes and intentions of the
                                officer corps as a whole, however. Broadly speaking, the armed
                                forces do not conceive of the military establishment as an
                                independent political force.</item>

                            <item>The uprising of last July was the first attack against the throne
                                since independence. It stemmed in part from the revulsion of a few
                                officers against the corruption rampant in the regime. This was
                                particularly true of General <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                    >Medbouh</persName>, who joined a group of middle grade officers
                                who had taken the initiative in planning the coup attempt. Despite
                                the King's subsequent purge of elements suspected of disloyalty,
                                there are reports that some officers remain concerned over the
                                continuing corruption in high places. Moreover, the purge may itself
                                have created resentment among the junior officers. There are also
                                signs that some officers are disturbed by the King's fitful
                                attention to the business of governing and by the unsteady course of
                                his relations with the civilian politicians. We do not have,
                                however, any concrete evidence of plotting against the King in the

                            <item>The Moroccan military establishment is distinguished by the high
                                percentage of Berbers in its senior ranks. During the Protectorate,
                                the French consciously encouraged Berbers to enter the military
                                profession as a counterweight to the Arabized majority which
                                dominated the political scene. Since independence there have been no
                                visible signs of significant ethnic rivalry within the military. But
                                in Moroccan society at large many Berbers resent the favored
                                position of the Arabs from Fez in the economic and administrative
                                sectors. The army leaders continue to favor Berber officers, and
                                Berber clannishness could become a more important factor in the

                                control of the internal security, police, and intelligence networks.
                                An outstanding administrator, he is also widely feared for his tough
                                and frequently brutal treatment of his opponents. (He is widely
                                believed to have been responsible for the kidnapping and murder of
                                leftist Moroccan opposition leader Medhi Ben Barka in 1965.) Long

                                some mystery. He is conservative, bent on maintaining order, and is
                                contemptuous of the civilian politicians. In the past he has shown
                                sympathy for efforts to strengthen the authority of the monarchy.
                                But since July 1971 his attitudes toward the regime have seemed less
                                clear. There is speculation among the officer corps that <persName

                            <item>The interplay of political forces goes on against the background
                                of increasingly serious economic and social problems. The country is
                                independent, largely self-sufficient, and has fairly flourishing
                                trade. It is not embroiled in conflict with its neighbors. But it
                                has many of the familiar ills of developing states: a wide gap
                                between rich and poor, massive unemployment and underemployment,
                                very rapid population growth, disaffected students and an embittered
                                younger urban generation, an ineffective and insufficient
                                educational system, and a self-centered and greedy elite. Morocco
                                exports over $100 million worth of phosphates annually, but it lacks
                                oil or other resources likely to provide the revenues needed for
                                rapid development.</item>

                            <item>The Moroccan economy has not recorded an impressive performance
                                since independence. It lags far behind neighboring oil-rich Algeria
                                in almost all indices of economic growth. Indeed, until 1967 gross
                                national product increased little faster than population growth.
                                Moreover, the country passed through inflation and recession which
                                depressed economic activity significantly. In the past few years,
                                however, the government has been somewhat more successful. It
                                increased investment in irrigation facilities, modernized phosphate
                                mines, and improved the efficiency of tax collection. Incentives to
                                private investment have also had effect, and balance-of-payments
                                surpluses have led to relaxation of foreign exchange and tariff
                                regulations. Morocco has shown a growth rate of about 5.5 percent
                                between 1968-1972, a favorable foreign exchange situation, increased
                                earnings from tourism, and bumper harvests. Though the July uprising
                                added uncertainties, some of the strains in the economy have been
                                relieved. And the prospects for growth in the small modern
                                industrial and agricultural sectors are good.</item>

                            <item>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> talks of the
                                need for social and economic development, but thus far has not made
                                a determined effort to attack the problems of the traditional sector
                                of the economy. Important in his thinking is the risk of unhinging
                                the political and social structure of the agricultural sector, which
                                sustains most of the population and contributes significantly to
                                overall economic activity. There has been some investment in dams
                                and irrigation facilities, but this is only beginning to show
                                results. Agriculture thus remains largely dependent on rainfall
                                which is capricious. Droughts have been frequent and productivity
                                has increased very slowly. More important, the King has not
                                encouraged efforts to change landholding patterns and the
                                organization of the rural sector as demanded by the National Front.

                            <item>These political constraints on development are not likely to be
                                soon overcome. The present government is unprepared to take bold
                                initiatives in economic and social realms. In fact, the nature and
                                execution of reform is a major point of dispute between the King and
                                the political parties, who call for such steps as agrarian reform
                                and nationalization of the key sectors of the economy. Even if the
                                National Front were to gain control of parliament following
                                elections, the party leaders themselves would find it hard to agree
                                on concrete programs. Under the best of circumstances, it would be
                                difficult to carry out radical land reform and to modernize
                                traditional agriculture practices. Reform of the French-style
                                educational system is also needed, but the present regime is not
                                disposed to make more than minimal changes. Any government would
                                find it both expensive and difficult to modernize Morocco's
                                schools.</item>

                                to the regime. The peasantry is politically inert and most of those
                                who are the most economically disadvantaged have the least political
                                power and initiative. It is not easy to mobilize the rural elements
                                for political ends even with appeals to economic self-interest.
                                Besides, the peasants are so steeped in the traditional mold that
                                they do not generally blame the regime for their poverty. For their
                                part, the political party leaders, perhaps because they recognize
                                that rousing the peasantry is dangerous for them, are not attempting
                                to foment rural discontent.</item>

                                forces of change. The growing exodus from the farms is creating ever

                                existence in slums on the outskirts of the cities, in effect living

                                coming increasingly to believe that the continuation of the monarchy
                                is incompatible with social and economic progress. All this

                            <item>Over the long run, this process poses a potent challenge to the
                                Moroccan Government. Up to now, the voices calling for a complete
                                restructuring of the system have been few; most advocates of this
                                view have found it necessary to go into exile. But student unrest is
                                growing, and the tiny Party of Liberation and Socialism (which is
                                the Moroccan Communist Party) is seeking a broader role, although to
                                date its activities have been well circumscribed by the security
                                forces. The King's immobility on the matter of reform will no doubt
                                encourage the growth of opposition. It will be some time, however,
                                before challenges from this quarter could seriously tax the capacity
                                of the regime to keep order. But clearly continuing failure to enact
                                reforms would promote an eventual radicalization of the Moroccan

                                politicians. The new constitution clearly represents less than they
                                had hoped to achieve. In an effort to press <persName

                                their followers to abstain nor did they repudiate the new
                                constitution once promulgated. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >Hassan</persName>'s postponement of elections also disappointed
                                some, although there are signs that the Istiqlal <pb n="10"

                                prospect of additional time in which to organize. But particularly
                                if the King postpones new parliamentary elections beyond 1973, the
                                temper of the opposition seems certain to rise. Already the
                                leadership of the UNFP faces pressure from its rank-and-file members
                                not to acquiesce in concessions to the King. And general
                                disillusionment over his failure to change his ways after the July
                                uprising is growing. Thus the civilian parties—whether in concert or
                                separately—are likely to increase their opposition to <persName

                                are that he will continue much in the pattern of the past, holding
                                the reins himself and turning to repression if need be. He clearly
                                prefers to rule through a non-party government, like the present
                                one, which is entirely subservient to his will. He may refuse to
                                allow elections on one pretext or another or he may rig the results
                                to favor his hand-picked candidates to deny the franchise
                                significant meaning. At the same time, he might feel it expedient to
                                leave hope alive that one day he would relax control in order to
                                lure the political parties to remain within the system, and he will
                                make gestures intended to assuage the opposition's

                                leadership; his personal habits militate against success in

                                would be likely to focus increasingly on the monarchy. In this

                            <item>There is, of course, a slight possibility that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will recognize this danger,
                                change his ways, allow parliament to be elected and function freely,
                                and gradually reduce his obvious political role. Even this
                                conciliatory posture would not guarantee a decrease in political
                                tension. Indeed, there is no assurance that the civilian opposition
                                would cooperate with the King. The relaxation of royal authority
                                might add to the uncertainties and whet politicians' appetites for
                                further power. It could therefore lead to louder and more articulate
                                demands by civilian political leaders. But the opposition is aware
                                of the risks in challenging the King this directly and is thus
                                likely to be moderate in its demands for some time. Hence, this
                                course offers some possibility of transition to a more broadly based
                                regime without passing through a revolutionary stage.</item>

                                in handling the problems of government. Indeed, the King's lengthy
                                consultations with the politicians have already raised within the
                                military both fears that he might surrender too much and concern at
                                his image of impotence. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"

                                whose effort miscarried last July, for he could use regular command
                                channels. Moreover, he is the most able general remaining in the

                                complicated the task of plotters within the armed forces as well as
                                increasing the reliability of the officer corps.</item>

                                likely to grow. The younger officers are better educated than their

                                revolutionary regimes, especially in Algeria, and to the cumulative
                                impact of antimonarchical sentiment elsewhere in the Arab world. In

                            <item>The King, who is by and large the master of Morocco's foreign
                                policy, has limited international aspirations. He is mainly
                                concerned with his neighbors in the MAGHREB and to a lesser extent
                                with recognition by African and Islamic nations as a leader. (He is

                                held in June 1972 and was elected its chairman.) He has backed down
                                from the territorial demands espoused by his father and is seeking
                                an amicable resolution of Morocco's border dispute with Algeria.
                                Libya's verbal support for the Moroccan insurgents last July has
                                seriously strained Moroccan-Libyan relations, producing reciprocal
                                propaganda attacks and mutual suspicions of subversion. And

                            <item>The US has been closely associated with the Moroccan monarchy over
                                the years. US military and economic aid have been relatively large
                                (about $860 million since independence of which some $77 million is
                                military and about $783 million economic). Moreover, inside Morocco

                            <item>But forces that threaten cooperation with the US are rising. As
                                elsewhere in Africa and Asia, nationalist feeling is growing in
                                Morocco. This process would no doubt be speeded if party politics
                                and political campaigning are permitted as provided by the
                                constitution. Both the UNFP and the Istiqlal stand for US withdrawal
                                from the Kenitra facilities, and would be tempted to raise this
                                issue on occasion to garner additional popular support. <persName

                                additional military aid. However, he may interpret present US plans
                                to reduce the complement at the Kenitra complex as an indication
                                that it is a waning asset for him. These calculations would weaken
                                his will to preserve the arrangement if popular pressure against the
                                American presence were to mount, say in the event of a major round
                                of fighting between Arabs and Israel.</item>

                            <item>The close relationship between the US and Morocco could be far
                                more seriously disrupted if the monarchy were to be overthrown. A
                                conservative military regime would try to maintain close ties with
                                the US. But even such a regime would be influenced by pressures of
                                nationalist sentiment. A radical regime would almost certainly adopt
                                a hostile stance to the US, and could be expected to terminate US
                                access to the Kenitra facilities.</item>

                            UNTRUSTWORTHY</p>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The attempt on August 16 by pilots of the Moroccan F-5 fighter squadron
                            to kill King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> brings into
                            question the loyalty of the Moroccan military. This loyalty is the key
                            to the durability of <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            regime, particularly in view of his failure in recent months to broaden
                            his power base by bringing the political opposition into the government.
                            Since the abortive coup at Skhirat in 1971, the King has demonstrated
                            that he is interested only in cosmetic reforms and that he has no
                            intention to share power in a meaningful way. He appeared content to let
                            his power rest on the narrow base of the military establishment, and
                            seemed sufficiently confident of Defense Minister General Mohamed
                            Oufkir's control to leave on an extended vacation to France at the end
                            of July.</p>

                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>'s total devotion to the monarchy
                            was important because he was both ruthless and well organized, traits
                            which enabled him to command respect from and inspire awe in the
                            military establishment. He supposedly lived by a severe code of honor
                            which had once led him to threaten suicide should the <pb n="2"

                            replacement, General Driss Ben Aomar, while a loyal and respected
                            officer (an ex-Chief of Staff) is not in good health and does not have
                            the presence of <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>. He is not
                            likely to be able to mend rifts within the military that may result from
                            this latest attempt to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_HII1"

                            of again purging the military, which has shown itself untrustworthy
                            twice in the past 13 months. To gain time and contemplate future
                            maneuvers, if the King remains true to form, he will attempt to reopen a
                            dialogue with the political opposition. He may be expected to downplay
                            the attempted assassination as an isolated incident and create an
                            atmosphere of dialogue and reform. Past experience, however, does not
                            suggest that <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will change
                            his personalized style of government based on a traditional web of
                            patron-client relationships.</p>

                            came just as <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> was
                            recovering his international stature as a result of his adroit handling
                            of the Rabat <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Summit and his election
                            as <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> President in June. He now stands
                            to have his prestige slip again, particularly if he finds it necessary
                            to devote all his energy to stabilizing his domestic scene. He may be
                            inclined, however, to exploit his role as <gloss target="#t_OAU1"
                                >OAU</gloss> President to try recovering international status as

                            probably be relieved that Morocco has been spared, at least for the
                            moment, the chaos that would have resulted had the coup been successful.
                            The hostile Libyan radio, on the other hand, lost no time in lauding the
                            attempt on the King and calling for other efforts.</p>

                            already alluded to US involvement because the pilots operated from

                            denied any role. While <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            probably feels any such charges groundless, he nonetheless might believe

                            US military presence; this would also serve him well in negotiations be

                        </list>
                        <p>The recent attempted coup in Morocco and the uncertain future facing the
                            regime lead me to believe that we should consider ways of reducing the
                            level of our military involvement and dependence on the Moroccan
                            communications facilities.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that some of our activities and military presence is directly
                            associated with the oral agreement with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> in 1963 concerning base management and
                            telecommunications training. I believe, however, that we should make
                            every effort, consistent with that agreement, to shift the actual
                            operating functions of the RMAF base at Kenitra to Moroccans,
                            restricting US personnel to advisory roles. I also recognize that any
                            precipitous withdrawal of personnel involved in training and base
                            operations might adversely affect our continued use of the US Navy
                            communications facilities, and that, therefore, any reductions in
                            presence would have to be done on a gradual basis.</p>
                        <p>I would like you to examine this situation and submit recommendations to
                            me on ways we can reduce our involvement by turning over to the
                            Moroccans as many of the operations and maintenance functions as
                            possible at the RMAF base at Kenitra, with US personnel, if necessary,
                            continuing to serve as advisors. I would also like you to examine the
                            impact of the Fleet Satellite Communications System on our continued
                            need for the communications sites at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel and the
                            desirability of reorienting these facilities by remote-keying (one of
                            the options in the 1971 <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> contingency
                            relocation plan), retaining the use of the Moroccan frequencies but
                            reducing our overall presence in Morocco, and how quickly this could be
                            accomplished. This evaluation should identify costs, personnel and any
                            anticipated degradation of capabilities. I understand the Navy has

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to assess the situation in Morocco
                            following the abortive coup attempt of August 16, to examine the level
                            of US military involvement and to propose certain interim actions you
                            may wish to consider toward reorienting our military posture there.</p>

                        <p>The situatation is outwardly calm but more ominous and ominous toward
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s longevity than after
                            last year's attempted coup. Few believe any longer that required reforms
                            are likely to be made, and the military's loyalty to the regime is more
                            suspect than ever.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> OUKFIR's complicity and alleged
                            suicide, the inept (if not poorly conceived) assassination attempt by
                            the F-5 squadron, the King's chastisement and usurpation of direct
                            control of the military and prospects of yet another purge of the
                            officer staff, has completely shattered the military's morale. The
                            military was the main prop of the regime. OUKFIR was the most qualified
                            leader considered capable of maintaining the military's cohesiveness and
                            loyalty. His adventure against <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> probably reflected his growing awareness of his
                            own pre-eminent personal authority among the military and belief that
                            the King could not or would not alter the regime's style. OUKFIR was
                            among the diminishing few who spoke frankly to the King about the
                            regime's shortcomings, and their relationship appeared to be under
                            increasing tension in recent months. While there is still much
                            monarchist sentiment among the poorer classes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s lavish life style, widespread
                            official corruption, critical unemployment, prospects of increased
                            autocratic rule and military disaffection are likely to accelerate the
                            process of the regime's disintegration.</p>
                        <p>With the demise of Oukfir and his almost embarassingly demonstrative
                            pro-US attitudes and apparent desire to maintain the monarchical
                            structure under his own regency, the next coup attempt is more likely to
                            be radical <pb n="3" xml:id="d128-03" facs="d128-03"/>and republican in
                            nature and not as favorably disposed to the US. The chance of our being
                            able to hang on to our naval communications station under such
                            circumstances, coupled with the new regime's likely propensity to look
                            for ways to rally domestic support and establish its Arab legitimacy,
                            would be greatly diminished. In the short run, however, while <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> rules, our Ambassador believes,
                            and we agree, that there may be some opinion favoring our withdrawal
                            from Kenitra but that the King is more likely to want to retain our
                            presence as a gauge of our<lb/>continued support for the regime.</p>

                        <p>We have about 1350 <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> personnel (mostly
                            Navy and Marine) and 1500 dependents located in Morocco at the Kenitra
                            complex that includes the Moroccan air facility (597 US personnel) and
                            two outlying communications sites at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel (647 US
                            personnel). The Navy communications station serves as the master station
                            for the area, controlling and coordinating all ship-to-shore
                            communications with US Naval forces operating in the Mediterranean. We
                            also have a 25-man <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, including a
                            five-man F-5 augmentation team at the airstrip, associated with a small
                            grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> training program (about $0.8
                            million a year) and a credit sales program (about $15 million a
                            year).</p>
                        <p>Our presence in Morocco was covered by an oral understanding between
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> and King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in 1963, when it was agreed that
                            we could continue to utilize the communications facilities in exchange
                            for our (i) putting Kenitra under Moroccan command, (ii) maintaining the
                            same level of operational expenditures ($2.1 million) and (iii) training
                            Moroccans in base management and telecommunications. (The sites of the
                            US communications facilities at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel were not
                            “Moroccanized.”)</p>
                        <p>This week, after the Moroccan Government's initial indication that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was suspected of complicity in
                            OUKFIR's attempted coup (apparently because of the impression that the
                            US F-5 advisors and Navy personnel at the airstrip must have assisted in
                            some way), the King publicly acknowledged that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>'s investigation showed no foreign
                            involvement. The King stated that American technicians are in Morocco to
                            teach Moroccans to fly and communicate, that it would be irresponsible
                            for him to incriminate them in the affair and that he was satisfied with
                            the role of the Americans. Our own investigation shows that US personnel
                            were ordered away from the operational area before the F-5s went off on
                            their first strike. Nonetheless, US personnel at the airstrip, in the
                            control towers and in supervisory management roles with the Moroccan
                            facility (e.g. generator plant) are a risk to possible exposure or
                            unwitting involvement in the future.</p>

                        <p>A major factor in the value of the station's location is the 250
                            frequencies Morocco makes available for our use that could not be
                            entirely compensated for elsewhere. At its own initiative, Navy ran a
                            test list last year on the impact of operating without the Moroccan
                            frequencies. The Navy believes the need of these frequencies will be
                            critical under our Fleet Satellite Communications Systems is operational
                            (estimated <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75/76) and may be of
                            significant residual importance after them. Since last year's coup, and
                            your request for the development of contingency relocation plans, the
                            Navy has been attempting to reduce its dependence on Morocco in its
                            future planning. As they identified in last year's plan, it would be
                            possible to reduce the number of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            personnel in Morocco significantly by remote-keying the Moroccan station
                            from another location in the Mediterranean, while retaining use of the
                            frequencies. Cost and degradation of capabilities are mitigating factors
                            that will have to be weighed again in light of the present situation in
                            Morocco.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Navy should examine immediately ways to reduce direct US involvement and
                            operational participation in the base management of the Moroccan
                            facility at Kenitra, shifting such functions to the Moroccans, with
                            residual US presence limited to advisory roles. This excludes the actual
                            sites of Navy's communications at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel that are
                            under direct Navy management and control and would be better left that
                            way in the current situation. Also, given the uncertain prospects for
                            the continuity of the regime, Navy's future requirements for the
                            communications facilities should be reviewed with a goal of reducing our
                            dependence and presence as quickly as practicable. I, therefore,
                            recommend that you sign the attached memorandum to the Chairman of the

                            16, the King is in a weak and difficult position. He has taken personal
                            command of the army but cannot be sure of its loyalty. His overtures to
                            the opposition parties to join the government and participate in
                            parliamentary elections have thus far been rebuffed. The King recognizes
                            his vulnerable situation and is working hard to reestablish his
                            authority and control. He may succeed. On the other hand, given the
                            fragile nature of the situation, another coup or assassination attempt
                            could come at any time and create a dangerously unstable and
                            unpredictable situation in Morocco.</p>

                            congratulations to the King was delivered on the day following the
                            attack and received headlines in the Moroccan press. We have also asked
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> to convey our
                            deep and sympathetic concern to King Hassan regarding the current
                            situation and to obtain the King's own assessment of his position.
                            Meanwhile, our present policies and programs in Morocco are continuing
                            without change for the time being. Our present posture is to continue to
                            give the King all possible indications of our continuing support.</p>
                        <p>We have, in addition, requested the intelligence community to prepare by
                            mid-September a Special National Intelligence Estimate on Morocco and
                            the King's prospects. We have asked <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            to check its resources in Morocco for possible clues to future

                                COUNTRIES CANNOT HAVE DEMOCRACY: EVEN IF THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL

                                POSSIBLY EVEN TO THE POSITION OF PRIME MINISTER. THE KING WAS
                                ENCOURAGED BY THE HEAVY REGISTRATION FOR THE ELECTIONS WHICH HAD

                                AUGUST 16 SHOULD BE PUNISHED “TO THE LIMIT.” THE ARMY HAD TO BE
                                BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. I REMARKED THAT WE HAD RECEIVED THE
                                IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS MUCH RESENTMENT AMONG MILITARY OFFICERS,
                                AND A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM PERSONALLY, AS A RESULT OF HIS
                                SHARP WORDS TO THE MILITARY AFTER AUGUST 16 AND BECAUSE THE
                                AMMUNITION HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM MILITARY UNITS. THE KING SAID
                                THAT THE MILITARY, BY THEIR SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR, HAD DESERVED THE
                                DRESSING DOWN HE GAVE THEM. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS NOT NORMAL THAT
                                MILITARY UNITS SHOULD HAVE THEIR AMMUNITION WITH THEM; IN MOST
                                COUNTRIES IN PEACETIME AMMUNITION WAS KEPT APART FROM THE UNITS IN

                                THEY WANTED “EVERYTHING, EXCEPT DEFENSE AND P.T.T.” THIS THE KING

                                NEGOTIATIONS HAD FAILED. THE KING'S READINESS TO GRANT SO MANY POSTS
                                TO THE OPPOSITION SHOWED HIS SINCERE DESIRE TO SHARE POWER. IT HAD
                                BEEN REVEALING THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL FRONT HAD
                                FRANKLY CONFESSED TO THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT AGREE AMONG

                                THE CONTINUATION OF ROYAL RULE IN MOROCCO, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE
                                INTENDS TO TRY TO LURE THE POLITICAL PARTIES INTO PARTICIPATING IN

                                PURGE THE ARMY IN ORDER TO TRY TO REMOVE ANY FURTHER DANGER FROM
                                THAT QUARTER. I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF
                                ABDICATING, AND I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT IF A PARLIAMENT WITH BROADER
                                POWERS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED, IT WILL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN
                                PREVENTING ROYAL ENCROACHMENT UPON ITS PREROGATIVES.</item>

                        <p>This estimate was requested by the Department of State to assess the
                            outlook for the Moroccan monarchy in the light of the 16 August coup
                            attempt. It is not intended to supersede <gloss target="#t_NIE1"
                                >NIE</gloss> 61-72, “The Outlook for Morocco”, dated 15 June 1972,
                            SECRET, since the analysis of underlying social, political, and economic
                            issues in that paper remains generally valid.</p>
                        <p>This paper concludes that King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is in a seriously weakened position and that a
                            successful attack on him could take place at any time. He retains some
                            assets and is a skillful political manipulator, but he devotes
                            insufficient effort to governing. The loyalty of the military
                            establishment, on which the throne has traditionally relied, is severely
                            strained and the King can no longer count upon his inherited role as
                            religious and temporal leader to sustain him.</p>
                        <p>In the near term, an attempt against <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is most likely to come as a blow by a handful of
                            military officers bent on ousting a monarch whom they now believe is an
                            obstacle to Morocco's progress. Over the longer term, a move against
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> could come as a part
                            of broader deterioration in the body politic, perhaps including a
                            breakdown in public order or the development of a revolutionary
                            movement. Since Hassan has isolated himself from most significant
                            sources of support in the country the odds are that one or another
                            attempt against him will succeed.</p>

                            <item>In little more than a year, there have been two attempts to
                                eliminate King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. The
                                details of the 16 August attack on his plane and the planning behind
                                it are still unclear, but there is good evidence that the Minister
                                of Defense and strong man of the Moroccan Armed Forces, Major
                                General Mohamed Oufkir, was implicated in the plot. In any case, it
                                is widely believed in Morocco that he directed the attempt and that
                                he was killed for this reason. There do not appear to be any
                                officers capable of replacing <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                    >Oufkir</persName> as a strong commander of the Moroccan Armed

                                abolished the position of Defense Minister and has assumed direct
                                control of the military establishment.</item>

                            <item>It is noteworthy that both the July 1971 attempt to overthrow the
                                King and the August 1972 effort were carried out by small groups of
                                military officers. We have little hard evidence about the beliefs
                                and ultimate aims of these men. Morocco has fundamental social and
                                economic problems, and discontent is growing in many parts of the
                                population, a state of unease which is reflected—though rather
                                ineffectively—in the political parties. As far as we know, however,
                                there were no contacts between the plotters and the civilian
                                political leaders. The military plotters were almost exclusively
                                conservative, rural Berbers—the majority element in the officer
                                corps. Available evidence indicates that the would-be regicides
                                aimed at eliminating the King and getting rid of the corrupt and
                                wasteful entourage that surrounds him. The officers did not appear
                                bent on bringing about sweeping social and economic change, although
                                they sought to constrict the monarchy's power secretly at least.
                                Relatively few officers were directly involved in each attempt, and
                                among others who may have had advance knowledge none appears to have
                                been sufficiently loyal to report the plans to the palace.</item>

                                measure of popular regard for the monarch's effectiveness as a

                            <item>Following the two attempted coups, King <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has expressed his
                                determination to go on ruling his country as before, but he cannot
                                be sure who is loyal to him and who is not. Members of the officer
                                corps cannot be sure of their own position or that of their brothers
                                in uniform. The ministers and senior officials for whom service to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has been the route
                                to riches are bound to consider whether their fortunes are now tied
                                to a waning star. Opposition political leaders will consider whether
                                recent events have made the time ripe for them to press <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> for a share of power in the
                                government or whether they should bide their time. These and other
                                forces—students, labor organizations, religious leaders—will be
                                jockeying for advantage in the months to come.</item>

                            <item>The key question of what effect this second coup attempt will have
                                on <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> himself is yet to
                                be answered. He has twice shown an admirable capacity to escape from
                                a hail of bullets and take charge of the situation. He has also over
                                the years demonstrated great ability at political manipulation,
                                balancing this political party, that clique or that person off
                                against one another. But he has also devoted a large part of his
                                time to the pursuit of pleasure. If <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >Hassan</persName> cannot buy the loyalty of his officers and
                                administrators nor count upon his inherited role as religious and
                                temporal leader to win him popular support, his future would seem to
                                lie in changing his method of governing and giving the appearance at
                                least of having the welfare of his people at heart. The coup attempt
                                of 1971 did not teach him anything in this regard. The attempt of
                                1972 may, but we doubt it strongly. His initial response has been to
                                blame virtually everyone else in Morocco for the conditions that

                                own performance can be faulted; he is a very traditional monarch in
                                the sense that he believes authority is his by right of inherited
                                status and does not need to be earned by effective governing of his
                                realm.</item>

                            <item>Traditionally the Moroccan military establishment has been a basic
                                prop for the throne, providing not only the power to maintain
                                internal security but a cadre of favored people from which
                                appointments to key provincial administrative positions were made.
                                There are no doubt many officers who remain loyal to the King, but
                                he cannot be sure who they are. He reacted to the disloyalty of a
                                few by giving a scathing talk to senior officers of the Royal
                                Moroccan Forces in which he impugned their integrity and that of the
                                institution of which they are a part. Furthermore, this denunciation
                                was broadcast to the entire population. He has taken over the
                                running of the military establishment on grounds that he cannot
                                trust any of his military subordinates; in these circumstances the
                                loyalty of the military has been put under severe strain.</item>

                                forces. But the General is not considered to be a strong person;
                                moreover, he is not in good health and has the further disadvantage
                                of being an Arab in charge of a largely Berber officer corps.</item>

                                colonel who may be even more disaffected with the monarchy. The
                                younger of these men, frequently better trained and educated than
                                their seniors, appear to have chafed under the command of older
                                generals, many of whom were pampered by the King and had become
                                tainted with his dissolute life style. The purge has removed,

                                individuals or groups within the Moroccan officer corps. The fact
                                that two groups, within a period of little more than a year, have
                                taken the risks involved in an assassination attempt should be
                                convincing evidence of deep dissatisfaction in the officer corps
                                with <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s rule. We doubt
                                that <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s purges have
                                eradicated this dissatisfaction. Indeed, there are signs that his
                                tongue-lashing and withdrawal of ammunition from military units has
                                turned others against him. The attempts of 1971 and 1972 were made
                                by officers who evidently sought more efficient government, but were
                                conservative in political outlook. As younger officers move up in
                                seniority we believe the attitude of would-be coup-makers is likely
                                to change, moving toward more radical social and political
                                forms.</item>

                                political ideas in other Arab states. Libya has been loud in praise
                                of Moroccan plotters, although there is no evidence of Libyan
                                contact with either the 1971 or 1972 plotters. The Libyans are
                                assisting Moroccan civilian exiles, but they appear to have no
                                direct working relationship with dissidents inside Morocco.
                                Moreover, Qaddafi's regime commands little respect in the Moroccan
                                Armed Forces. The Algerians, who are more likely to have influence
                                in Morocco, have no love for <persName corresp="#p_HII1"

                                deter opposition initiatives, however. Such support as he derives
                                from these grass roots is diffused and disorganized and, in the
                                King's mind, probably exaggerated. Moreover, the rural populace is
                                largely unarmed and would not constitute an effective counterforce

                                for themselves but to support his rule. Others probably will
                                distance themselves somewhat in an effort to avoid ruination if the

                                try to insure that he is not taken by surprise a third time. His

                                military and security forces. He reportedly plans to reduce the size
                                of the regular army (now about 50,000) and may lean more on the
                                gendarmerie and other internal security forces. In the near term at

                                little in common with the military establishment. Moreover, neither
                                the politicians nor the military are likely to believe that they can
                                force <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> into the role of
                                a constitutional monarch. The parties, principally the Istiqlal and

                                lost effectiveness over the last 10 years or so. They have had
                                little success in attracting support from an apathetic populace.
                                Their very poor performance in office in the late 1950s and early
                                1960s made it relatively easy for <persName corresp="#p_HII1"

                                and to promise a chance at office—and the perquisites that go with

                                alienating some of their supporters by accepting, since Hassan
                                almost certainly would not offer them truly meaningful political
                                power, nor even a chance at it through free elections. If, on the
                                other hand, they choose to go into outright opposition, say

                                severe and violent repression from the security forces. In this
                                situation our best guess is that, while some political leaders may
                                reach an accommodation with the King, most will try to straddle the
                                fence as long as possible and in effect do very little but make some
                                verbal remonstrations against the monarchy. They may be influenced

                                rearrangement of foreign ties—in order to maintain his throne.
                                Morocco presently has close bonds to France and to the US. The
                                former is the major source of foreign investment and is the
                                principal foreign cultural influence in Morocco; the latter supplies
                                some $45 million annually in aid, mostly in surplus food. <persName

                                favors are not generally popular in Morocco. Prior to the latest
                                coup attempt, he had been increasing the French role in his internal
                                security apparatus; he may now attempt to engage the US more firmly
                                in defense of his regime, calling for greater intelligence support
                                and other forms of assistance in the security sphere, despite the

                                circumstances is pandering to xenophobic sentiment. He might well
                                choose to move against French investment in Morocco or to reassert

                                political trouble in Morocco. Unemployment and poverty are endemic
                                and growing in the cities which, with their large numbers of

                                communists' illegal Party for Liberation and Socialism may come to
                                believe that the recent blows show King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >Hassan</persName>'s weakness. They could try to further weaken
                                the King by such revolutionary tactics as mass demonstrations,
                                general strikes, and riots, and perhaps even by turning to urban
                                terrorism. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> would

                                no longer loyal. And if violence were to persist over an extended
                                period, it could add a very unsettling element to <persName

                                regime that succeeds him. A successful coup by another group of

                                different in political outlook than the present one, but presumably
                                less corrupt and possibly more efficient. On the other hand, the
                                initiative might be seized by more socialist-minded officers from
                                the middle or lower ranks. Their orientation could be basically
                                “Morocco-first” and reformist, or it could be of a revolutionary
                                cast and more militantly Arab.</item>

                                to increase its own popularity by a cheap and easy victory. The
                                foreign presence in Morocco would almost certainly come under
                                attack. Inviting the US to leave its military communications
                                facilities would be an obvious move for any government. A
                                nationalist one would almost certainly do this—and probably also

                            was issued asking for a study of US policy toward Morocco and an
                            evaluation of our interests there. The study prepared [next tab - “NSSM
                            160 Study"] was to identify US interests as precisely as possible,
                            evaluate their relative importance, and delineate alternative approaches
                            that we might take to serve those interests. Attached to the NSSM 160
                            options paper [small tab marked “<gloss target="#t_SNIE1"

                            and the Voice of America relay station at Tangier.</p>
                        <p>The operational situation with which we are dealing is this: Foreign

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that the King would like to review the US
                            military presence in Morocco at an early opportunity. Since then, the
                            general outline of Moroccan thinking has emerged as follows: <list>
                                <item>—They would like the US to consolidate its facilities from
                                    three to two. This means closing the Kenitra training base (of
                                    little intrinsic importance to us, but of high visibility), but
                                    continuing at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel, two important elements
                                    in the US naval communications network in the Mediterranean and
                                    eastern Atlantic.</item>
                                <item>—Morocco would like a higher “rent” payment for the remaining
                                    facilities. Our current aid effort is not formally linked to the
                                    use of the three facilities, and the Moroccans would like to
                                    establish this link, citing our arrangements with Spain as a
                                    model.</item>
                                <item>—Finally, Morocco wants more control of the US facilities.
                                    Some Moroccans still have lingering doubts over the US role in
                                    the most recent assassination attempt against the King.</item>

                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has left the Moroccan

                                relieved senior officers of their commands. Morale and loyalty are
                                both low, and another coup attempt from within the armed forces
                                could come at any time.</item>
                            <item>—The King's reaction to the most recent attempt on his life has
                                been to blame everyone but himself. He shows no signs of preparing
                                to change his style of rule, nor does he devote much time or energy
                                to the business of governing. Unlike Jordan's King Hussein and the
                                Shah of Iran, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                                does not sense the need to bring about reforms as a way of
                                bolstering the monarchy. He does not readily take advice, and shows
                                no signs of changing his ostentatious personal life-style.</item>
                            <item>—The King is unlikely to make a real opening to the opposition
                                that would allow it to share power and responsibility with him.
                                After going through the motions of consulting with opposition
                                parties with a view toward broadening the base of the regime, the
                                King has named his brother-in-law as Prime Minister, who in turn has
                                formed a government of unimpressive technicians and totally lacking
                                in opposition members. Elections are promised for next spring, but
                                for the moment the political atmosphere in the country is rather
                                bleak.</item>
                            <item>—The French and Algerians, as influential third parties, continue
                                to support <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, but are
                                hedging their bets in case he falls by keeping in touch with
                                possible successor leaders. The Libyans remain actively hostile to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, but with little
                                capability to act. The real danger to <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                    >Hassan</persName> is internal, not external.</item>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d134-03" facs="d134-03"/>
                            <item>—As a means of staying in power by striking a nationalist pose,
                                the King may try to move against the large foreign presence in
                                Morocco, although the urgency of his doing so is less now that his
                                attempt at reconciliation with the opposition has failed. US
                                facilities at the Kenitra complex would be particularly vulnerable.
                                Already the King has said that the American presence should be the
                                subject of new talks with the US. Any successor government would be
                                even more likely to move against the US presence.</item>
                            <item>—Despite the apparent odds against him, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> still has some assets that
                                may help him stay in power. The countryside appears to remain
                                passively loyal; the Gendarmerie seems to be a reliable instrument
                                for maintaining internal order; the opposition political parties are
                                divided and not particularly effective; this year the economy has
                                performed reasonably well, although long-term social and economic
                                problems remain; new governors have been appointed in the
                                countryside and may help improve administration there; finally, the
                                King, on occasion, shows himself to be a skillful political
                                manipulator, and has been able to eliminate many of his powerful
                                opponents following two unsuccessful coup attempts.</item>
                            <item>—<hi rend="underline">This evaluation adds up to a rather
                                    pessimistic assessment for Morocco. Another coup attempt seems
                                    likely in the near future, and the odds are that eventually one
                                    will succeed</hi>. The character of any new government after a
                                successful coup is difficult to predict. A successor government is
                                perhaps more likely to be conservative or moderately nationalist
                                than revolutionary, but in any case it would seek to reorder its
                                relations with influential outsiders like France and the US.</item>

                                    agreement with Morocco dating from 1963, whereby we provide
                                    training for the Moroccan air force on a base at Kenitra (a
                                    “Moroccanized” facility), while retaining full control over two
                                    naval communications stations at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel.
                                    Kenitra is large and visible, but not very important to US
                                    interests, while the smaller facilities provide an essential
                                    link in the naval communications network in the Mediterranean
                                    and eastern Atlantic. Because of the presence of the facilities
                                    in Morocco, the US has use of 293 Moroccan registered
                                    frequencies. Their loss would “significantly degrade” the Navy's

                                    and Bouknadel, but not Kenitra, as highly important. [Comment:
                                    The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> view tends to downplay
                                    several aspects of the communications facilities and the
                                    Moroccan frequencies. First, much of the normal naval
                                    communications load is not absolutely essential. In an emergency
                                    or crisis, the Navy, without Moroccan facilities, could
                                    communicate with the Sixth Fleet, provided that it limited its
                                    messages to those of priority importance. In a crisis, the US
                                    would also probably feel free to use Moroccan-registered
                                    frequencies, even if formal permission was lacking. Second, the
                                    Fleet Satellite system could go into effect somewhat earlier
                                    than <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 if this became an

                                    elsewhere, such as in Spain. Their own contingency paper,
                                    however, indicates that in an emergency they could move to Rota,
                                    Spain, in a little over three months at a cost of well under $10

                        <p>The key question for the US in Morocco is how best to protect its
                            interests: by continuing current policy or even increasing support for
                            the monarchy; or by disengaging, at least selectively. The King himself
                            may move against US interests if it suits his political needs, or he may
                            be replaced soon by a government that would ask the US to cut back on
                            its presence.</p>
                        <p>A basic judgment is needed to inform policy choices at this point: Should
                            the US protect against the impact of abrupt loss of its interests in
                            Morocco by hedging its bets and, in the case of the communications
                            facilities, transferring some functions to other locations: or are our
                            interests of such importance and so difficult to assure without a
                            friendly regime in Morocco that we should continue, or perhaps increase,
                            our support for <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. In the
                            former case, the risk is that our moves toward disengagement may weaken
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and lead him to
                            retaliate; in the latter case, however, the problem is that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> disappears, we have no strong
                            fallback position to protect both tangible security interests and less
                            tangible political ones.</p>
                        <p>The key issues in formulating policy toward Morocco are the US posture
                            toward the King; the US military presence at the Kenitra complex; levels
                            of US aid; contacts with opposition groups; and the <gloss

                                    this policy would keep the US closely committed to <persName

                                    expenditure of resources or heavy involvement in Moroccan
                                    politics. [Comment: Recent Moroccan statements suggest that
                                    selective disengagement may be forced on us whether we want it
                                    or not. Again the question need not be one simply of
                                    disengagement or involvement, but rather the mix and the issues
                                    on which we concentrate efforts and resources. If the Moroccans
                                    ask us to leave Kenitra, this need not necessarily lead to a
                                    cutback in all other US programs. There are likely to be some
                                    official programs and many private sector relationships that
                                    will be welcome under virtually any regime and that would make a
                                    useful contribution to the overall US-Moroccan
                                    relationship.]</item>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> has asked
                            for a review of the US military presence in Morocco. He has hinted that
                            perhaps the three facilities we now have could be consolidated, thereby
                            lowering the US profile. The choice for the US seems to be whether to
                            seize the opportunity offered by the Moroccans to disengage gradually at
                            their initiative, allowing an orderly transfer of the communications
                            facilities to other locations, or whether to pay a higher price to
                            retain the current arrangements.</p>

                        <p>The options paper stops short of spelling out the concrete choices as
                            they now present themselves. Three specific decisions that could
                            usefully emerge from this policy review are: <list>
                                <item>—A directive to Defense to plan to close down the Kenitra
                                    Training base in response to Moroccan requests. All
                                    communications functions would be consolidated at the remaining
                                    two facilities and would be operated with a low visibility US
                                    presence. Until alterna tive communications networks are
                                    available, we will try to hold onto these facilities.</item>
                                <item>—Ask Defense to examine the possibility of bringing the Fleet
                                    Satellite System into operation before <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                        >FY</gloss> 1977. If this is primarily a budgetary or
                                    bureaucratic problem rather than a technical one, a high-level
                                    directive should be able to speed up the acquisition of this
                                    alternative communications channel.</item>
                                <item>—Ask State to prepare an aid package for Morocco that will
                                    conform to the situation following the closure of the US Naval
                                    Training Command at the Kenitra base. In return for allowing us
                                    to continue at the other two facilities, the Moroccans will
                                    expect at least as much aid as in the past. To reach this level,
                                    we may need to come up with some new programs, perhaps
                                    concentrating more heavily on the development side where the
                                    regime is particularly weak.</item>

                        <p>It was agreed that: <list>
                                <item>— It is strategically important for the United States to
                                    maintain friendly relations with Morocco. If it came to a
                                    choice, we would definitely sacrifice our communications
                                    facilities for the sake of our overall relationship.</item>
                                <item>— The King is still the focal point of authority and we should
                                    support him and be responsive to his needs. While he is in
                                    power, we should not actively disengage from our relationship
                                    with his regime.</item>
                                <item>— We should begin reducing our profile and presence at
                                    Kenitra, make contingency preparations for the transfer of our
                                    facilities out of Morocco in the event that becomes necessary
                                    and in the long term reduce our dependence on the Moroccan

                            the King is the only significant force in the country. He represents the
                            only force with any tradition, and that's an important factor here.
                            Popular support for the military isn't so great either. I would not
                            underestimate the King; he is a very shrewd operator. He has now escaped
                            two attempts on his life, both of which should have killed him. I can
                            imagine that the thought may be prevalent in Morocco today that, “is
                            Allah trying to tell us something?”</p>

                                >Walters</persName>) has been saying. The King, by his highly
                            personal and arbitrary style of rule, has alienated some of his
                            supporters, but the monarchy is still the only strong force in the
                            country.</p>

                            to him, or too closely identified with him. Nor do we want to get

                            not. We are maintaining a policy of friendly relations with Morocco, and
                            we want to maintain friendly relations with the King. If he is going to
                            be displaced, we will continue to support him until that time.
                            Meanwhile, we have interests at Kenitra and it would be prudent for us
                            to reduce our presence there to the extent that we can. If the
                            opposition to the King comes to power, we may not be able to keep our
                            installations at all. We have two choices here, we could begin a crash
                            program to phase everything out by 1976 or sooner, or we could begin a
                            gradual disengagement.</p>

                            but I doubt the Spanish will greet an American base with open arms. The
                            Moroccans wouldn't be happy about the base moving to Spain and may
                            pressure Spain not to accept it.</p>

                            would demand a high price. The King is pressing us to reduce our
                            profile. I understand we have some 600 to 650 people currently at

                                    this trend. The King apparently does not believe we had no prior
                                    knowledge of the August 16 coup attempt.</item>

                                    high-level representative to Morocco to propose “conciliatory
                                    changes in the status of US bases.” Once again, the US should
                                    take this initiative. During this visit we should arrange to
                                    invite the King to the US sometime in 1973. This visit would be
                                    in the context of re-negotiating US assistance programs.</item>

                                >Hassan</persName> and his new Prime Minister are feeling insecure
                            and are grasping for reassurance from the United States. Objectively,
                            the relationship between the US and Morocco has not “deteriorated,
                            although the King's own position has. The problem we face is that the
                            present uncertainty and insecurity in Morocco are largely the result of
                            the King's policies and there is little we can do to help bolster his
                            domestic political standing.</p>
                        <p>The King has made it clear that he believes we were somehow involved in
                            recent coup attempts against him, which is not true, and is threatening
                            to turn to France if we do not take initiatives to improve relations. We
                            have no reason to be unhappy with the idea of his turning to France,
                            whatever that may mean, nor can we dispel his suspicions of our
                            involvement in plots against him. What we can and should do is to carry
                            forward the dialogue on our mutual interests begun by Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> in New York this
                            fall, especially on revising our communications presence as the King
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>It would seem better for the Department of State to handle this task,
                            however, rather than the President. State had already sounded out Robert
                            Murphy about visiting Morocco as a special emissary to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> early next year, and this seems
                            like a reasonable approach. You may recall that he did this once before
                            in similar circumstances. Our recommendation below is cast in this
                            vein.</p>

                            would seem best not to be overly responsive to the King's ill-tempered
                            comments relayed through an intermediary or in reply to an indirect bid
                            from the Moroccan Prime Minister through Kleberg.</p>

                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> is
                            expected to break his long silence on plans for the succession by the
                            end of March. The prospects are that the transfer of power, whenever it
                            occurs, will be orderly. Shortly, thereafter, however, divisions within
                            the party-government apparatus may break into the open. In such a
                            contest, economic czar Ahmed Ben Salah is likely to emerge on top,
                            although perhaps within a collegial leadership. The pragmatic and
                            essentially Western orientation of the regime is likely to continue,
                            although no successor can be expected to be as firmly in control—and as
                            outspokenly pro-US—as <persName corresp="#p_BH2"

                            forward to several years of active leadership. A recent bout with the
                            flu—for which a leading French heart specialist flew to Tunis—caused
                            concern mainly because it came only a week after his annual month's

                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> had the National
                            Assembly pass an amendment to the succession provision of the
                            constitution in 1966, but he never signed it, apparently fearing it
                            would reduce his maneuverability. In January 1968 <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> said he would announce a new

                            That meeting, twice postponed, is now scheduled for later this month.
                            The impression prevails that <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> will for the first time name a prime minister,
                            and that whoever holds that post will succeed to the Presidency.</p>

                            the President's absences, was considered, the almost inevitable
                            successor, at least for the medium term. Although a colorless figure,

                            >Bourguiba</persName>'s shadow, Ladgham is influential, hard-working,
                            and a man with few enemies. He would be the candidate best suited to

                            power has steadily accrued to Ahmed Ben Salah, the young (43) and
                            dynamic architect of Tunisia's planned economy. He heads a
                            super-ministry comprising the former ministries of Plan, Finance,
                            Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce. Last July <persName

                            Education as a mark of special confidence. While still dependent upon
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s support, Ben Salah
                            has placed loyal proteges throughout the government and party machinery.
                            The greatest obstacle in his path is probably the number of enemies he
                            has accumulated among conservatives, businessnen, trade unionists, and
                            small farmers—all of whom have been hurt by his reforms. These elements
                            might well succeed in preventing his selection.</p>

                            differences in method and personality, could lead to a split when

                            possibilities for an open clash by creating some form of collegial
                            rule—possibly by sharing the powers now held by the Presidency with a

                            to reduce then substantially. At the same time, no successor is likely

                        <p>Amembassies: TUNIS ALGIERS RABAT<lb/>Complete Distribution Made by CMS
                            4/15/69</p>
                        <p>After a preliminary exchange of comments between the two Secretaries on
                            their pleasure at establishing a personal acquaintance, the Tunisian
                            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs first outlined Tunisia's views on
                            the importance of its close relations with the United States and its
                            sincere appreciation for the benefits, political and economic, it has
                            received from them. He then dwelt on Tunisia's preoccupation with the
                            threats to its security building up in its part of the
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., recalled that it
                            was President EISENHOWER who wisely tried to stem the Communist advance
                            in the Middle East and Mediterranean by offering the protection of the
                            EISENHOWER Doctrine in 1957. Tunisia was the first country to accept and
                            welcome the Doctrine, but unfortunately President EISENHOWER's
                            objectives had not been achieved, and today the danger in the
                            mid-Mediterranean is greater than ever.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Minister referred to the analysis of the situation in the
                            Mediterranean which his father had given to President <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d139-02" facs="d139-02"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> two days before and which
                            he himself had also discussed with Secretary Laird yesterday. Radical
                            countries like Algeria and the UAR, for shortsighted and demagogic
                            reasons, had opened themselves to Soviet ambitions. These countries, he
                            was sure, had not intended at the outset to mortgage their national
                            independence to the Soviet Union, but gradually this was what had
                            happened. It was as if first their fingers, then their hand and now
                            their arm had been caught in the gears of the Soviet machinery. For
                            example, the Rumanian Foreign Minister had told him the Algerians
                            requested deletion from the joint Algerian-Rumanian communiquè of a
                            sentence condemning “foreign intervention” on the grounds that this
                            might be embarrassing to Algeria's “friends.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., warned that while
                            the Soviet Union might at one level pursue a policy of coexistence with
                            the United States, on another level it was constantly nibbling away at
                            the peace and security of other countries, seeking to expand its sway,
                            its power and its influence. This was particularly true in the
                            Mediterranean, for Russia's dream of “warm waters” went back to Peter
                            the Great. The Soviet Mediterranean fleet had to be warned away by
                            Tunisia, something the Soviet Union did not at all appreciate.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question, the Tunisian Secretary estimated that there are
                            now six to eight thousand Soviet civilian and military technicians in
                            Algeria. When skepticism was expressed that the number was anywhere near
                            so high, he insisted, and claimed that the estimate had come originally
                            from Messmer, the French Minister of the Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., then expanded on
                            the problems Tunisia faced in its relations with Algeria. As a
                            consequence of the protracted quarreling among Algerian politicians at a
                            much earlier period, Algeria had lost most of its elite, who were swept
                            aside and discredited when the Algerian Revolution finally erupted.
                            Algeria was led today by men of little or no education, many of them
                            (like <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>) with an outlook
                            on the world that was five hundred years behind the times. The
                            ingratitude, impetuosity and demagoguery which characterize Algerian
                            leadership were due less to stupidity than to immaturity. The men now in
                            control of Algeria's destiny were simply neither intellectually nor
                            emotionally equipped to provide the kind of rational and forward-looking
                            leadership Algeria so badly needed. They started first by providing the
                            country arms and then grandiose industries for which the country was not
                            yet prepared. Tunisia started by giving its people food and work, and in
                            contrast <pb n="3" xml:id="d139-03" facs="d139-03"/>with the Algerians,
                            the Tunisians were a happy people. Tunisia was attacked for its
                            “moderation” but had too much respect for the real values of revolution
                            to prostitute its meaning in the way others did. Tunisia did its best to
                            have satisfactory relations with Algeria but this was not easy, and the
                            task was made no easier by Tunisia's friendship for the West.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the threat Tunisia feared was from the Soviet
                            penetration in the Mediterranean or from Algeria. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., replied, both. Tunisia
                            today more than ever needed the sense of security that had been offered
                            and accepted under the EISENHOWER Doctrine in 1957. Tunisia has of
                            course in recent years been given to understand in various ways that we
                            would not stand idle if it were ever attacked; but even suppose, for
                            example, the Sixth Fleet came to its rescue in event of overt
                            aggression, the damage—the political damage—would already have become
                            irreparable. What Tunisia needed, rather, was a deterrent. Tunisia had
                            no intention of wasting its resources on a large army and was keeping
                            its military budget within 10 percent of the total, but it should have,
                            first of all, sufficient military strength of its own to make a would-be
                            aggressor think twice. In addition, the Tunisian Government had given
                            considerable thought over the past several years to how to supplement
                            self-defense measures with an assurance of protection from its friends.
                            Tunisia was at one time ready to enter an alliance. However, it is well
                            aware that today the mood of the US Congress is not favorable to new
                            security commitments of a formal nature. There were other ways,
                            nevertheless, in which the interest of the United States in Tunisia's
                            security could be made clear to potential adversaries.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing, he had two proposals to present for our
                            serious consideration. First of all, there should be a complete review
                            by our two governments of the conclusions of the Clowes Report [a US
                            military team study in late 1965 of Tunisian army needs] to take into
                            account the formidable new dangers that have arisen in the
                            mid-Mediterranean in the intervening years. Secondly, it would be
                            helpful if an American firm could undertake to develop the ship-repair
                            facilities at Menzel-<persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            near Bizerte for the use of commercial shipping plying the
                            Mediterranean. Bizerte was very favorably placed to provide such
                            service, and there could be a real economic benefit to Tunisia; but over
                            and beyond the commercial interest the presence of an American firm
                            would also signify to others US political interest in Tunisia's general
                            welfare and security. If an <pb n="4" xml:id="d139-04" facs="d139-04"
                            />American firm could not be found, it might be possible to encourage a
                            firm from Denmark or Norway, both NATO allies, to undertake the same
                            kind of commercial development. The presence of either one would have
                            much the same political advantage that Tunisia seeks in trying to enlist
                            our interest.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would discuss the questions raised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>, and we would be in touch with
                            the Tunisians in due course.</p>
                        <p>In acknowledging the Tunisian Foreign Minister's expression of
                            appreciation for US economic help, the Secretary of State noted the
                            difficulties we are having with Congress on aid appropriations
                            generally, but said that Tunisia was of course among the favored
                            candidates for aid in Africa, and we would continue to do our best
                            within the limitations of Congressional appropriations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>,Jr., indicated complete
                            understanding as regards current attitudes in the US affecting foreign
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed on the cordial note which had prevailed throughout.
                            The Secretary emphasized the extremely favorable and well deserved
                            reputation which Tunisia had earned for itself in this country and said
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> valued very
                            highly our close friendship with Tunisia. The new US administration
                            wished to preserve these good relations and to improve them—if indeed
                            that were possible. He knew that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> already considered them excellent. The two Foreign
                            Secretaries looked forward to their next opportunity to meet, perhaps
                            later this year.</p>

                                is less concerned with technical critique of Clowes report

                                opinion at home and abroad, that Tunisia can count on protection to
                                of powerful US. They may well hope that such demonstration would in
                                part take tangible form of additional military aid, but perhaps of
                                equal or greater importance in their minds are those political and
                                psychological gestures by US which would bespeak continuity and
                                reliability of US interest in Tunisian security and welfare.

                                        outdated Clowes team's conclusions. Hypothetical threat
                                        dealt with in Clowes Report was that from Algerian armed
                                        forces. Our preliminary judgment is that potential Algerian

                        <p>The Foreign Minister and the Secretary spent an hour today discussing
                            Tunisia's security concerns. Starting off with a review of the Libyan
                            coup, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., said Tunisia
                            was of course against coups in principle as they usually presaged a
                            period, not of stability, but of instability. The Libyan coup as Tunisia
                            analyzed it seemed to be the work of amateurs who must have acted with
                            little advance preparation, for it is impossible to keep a secret for
                            long in the Arab world. They were reacting out of frustration to an
                            unsatisfactory internal situation in Libya, which was probably bound to
                            bring a drastic change sooner or later. The problem is that they seem to
                            represent a mixed bag of elements and probably will not know what to do
                            next. There will be plenty of outsiders—Bathists, Nasserists,
                            Soviets—eager to influence them. Tunisia agreed that there were some
                            hopeful signs and Tunisia, like us, would do its best to get close to
                            the new regime and to exert a constructive influence on it. But odds for
                            success were not high. The Libyan elite from which the young military
                            officers have come has generally been educated in Egypt or by Egyptians.
                            They lack political maturity. It is significant that they have used
                            phrases familiar in the Middle East context but have said not a word
                            about the Maghreb. It is significant that the only Arab diplomat to be
                            received at <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> headquarters on the
                            first day of the coup was the Iraqi Charge.</p>

                        <p>In any event, while trying to make the best of the situation, Tunisia
                            also had to think of the worst. Tunisia was a small morsel sandwiched
                            between two radically inclined and unpredictable countries. Libya was
                            susceptible to foreign influences and had the means for troublemaking.
                            Radical Algeria had a government increasingly unsure of the support of
                            its people. The very existence of Tunisia as a successful moderate
                            country on close terms with the West is, from their point of view, an
                            unwelcome example. “The race to take possession of the Libyan revolution
                            is on,” said <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>. The
                            Algerians, the Egyptians and the Bathists all have their various games
                            to play in Libya, and behind them looms a still larger problem, the
                            Soviet Union. It is instructive to remember, said the Foreign Minister,
                            that “Libya was invented in 1951 to prevent a Soviet trusteeship.” How
                            could the Libyan Government today ever renew the lease for Wheelus Air
                            Base?</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Government, he continued, knows that it is responsible for
                            its popularity at home and for internal security. By what it does it
                            must earn and keep the confidence of the Tunisian people. It is in the
                            matter of external security that it needs help, for here it feels
                            insecure and this anxiety is shared by the people. In many respects they
                            still lack sophistication and cling to old ways and old ideas. They must
                            see tangible evidence that government policies are succeeding. The
                            public outburst at the time of the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 was a
                            revelation to Tunisia's leaders, showing there are deep wells of emotion
                            that can be stirred up in a crisis. By the same token the Tunisian
                            Government has come recently to realize that Ben Salah's program for
                            putting the country under cooperatives was moving too rapidly for public
                            tolerance. Hence the recent reform and cutback of the cooperative
                            movement and the Cabinet shakeup.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian people and Tunisia's military cadres must likewise see
                            evidence—tangible evidence—that cooperation with the West is producing
                            military security. Tunisia's officers are not like Libya's, but they too
                            are feeling frustrated, and the government is increasingly worried about
                            them. They have received modern military training in France and
                            elsewhere in the West but see that they lack adequate modern military
                            equipment (“There is not even enough training ammunition!”) and that the
                            Tunisian army is still worth nothing militarily. In addition to
                            receiving modern military equipment, they must also feel they have a
                            constructive role in the peacetime life of the nation, and this the
                            Tunisian Government hopes to provide. Finally, Tunisia knows that real
                            security comes primarily through economic and social progress. In
                            acquiring military equipment, therefore, there is the financial aspect
                            to consider. Tunisia cannot afford to add to its budgetary burdens if
                            this means neglecting essential economic programs.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d141-03" facs="d141-03"/>
                        <p>With this background, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>,
                            Jr., said he wanted to speak now with utter frankness; perhaps we would
                            even detect a certain bitterness, which was real. Over the past ten
                            years Tunisia has developed a growing feeling that the United States is
                            pursuing a kind of disengagement around the world. Perhaps this is
                            because the US feels safe with its advanced military weapons and
                            technology and also with the hot line to Moscow. But this does not mean
                            that the Soviets have stopped expanding their sphere of action or that
                            the dangers for a little country like Tunisia have stopped growing.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, Tunisia more than ever feels the need for additional
                            security. Tunisia is not unreasonable in its expectations. It knows
                            about US Congressional attitudes and the difficulties of formal security
                            commitments. But the conclusions of the Clowes report need updating in
                            light of Tunisia's increasingly precarious position in its part of the
                            world, and Tunisia needs more, and more modern, military equipment.
                            Tunisia is by no means addressing itself to the United States alone in
                            this matter. The Tunisian Minister of Defense, M'Zali, has been invited
                            to visit French Defense Minister Debre in mid-October. The Italians are
                            helping with a radar capability in northern Tunisia (the Foreign
                            Minister noted at this point that the US might assist in extending radar
                            coverage to the rest of the country, as radar would have a commercial as
                            well as a military utility). The Tunisians had even detected an
                            increasing Spanish interest in their welfare, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., thought he might stop in
                            Madrid on his way home from his present trip.</p>
                        <p>What he had to ask of us now was to reconsider the Clowes conclusions and
                            our present <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program in the hope that
                            our assistance could be augmented to serve Tunisia's needs more
                            effectively. If we could not help, we should at least tell the Tunisians
                            so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he appreciated the frankness with which the Foreign
                            Minister had set forth Tunisia's concerns. We ourselves were very much
                            concerned by what had happened in Libya. There was no advance notice of
                            the coup, it unfolded as an internal matter, there was no sign of
                            effective opposition, and there was thus no basis whatsoever on which we
                            could act. Consequently we did not want to react adversely to the coup,
                            particularly as no one can foretell just what its outcome will be. We
                            have come to realize from this and other experiences that the US is not
                            really in a good position to cope with this kind of situation and that
                            our best recourse is to maintain a low posture until we can see more
                            clearly how to adapt to the new situation (<persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., nodded his agreement with this
                            reasoning).</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d141-04" facs="d141-04"/>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that there has been a great deal of
                            misunderstanding about disengagement. Disengagement is a misleading
                            term. All are talking about is that there is a limit to what we can do
                            to sustain foreign governments in power, particularly those which are
                            unpopular with their own people—not, of course, the case with
                            Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>We are simply reviewing our commitments and responsibilities throughout
                            the world to make sure they are commensurate with our capabilities. By
                            the same token we want to make sure that the assistance we give is
                            effectively utilized. It is understandable that the American taxpayer
                            finds it difficult to understand why we spend great sums of money to
                            help shore up a foreign government in the name of stability, perhaps
                            only to have that government overthrown and its country more unstable
                            than ever. In some parts of the world we have been put under pressures
                            almost akin to blackmail. Now what we are trying to do is introduce more
                            realism and efficacy into our programs of foreign assistance. This is
                            the background for some of our recent Asian policy statements, which
                            have attempted to put the responsibilities and capabilities of our
                            nation and those we are trying to help into more realistic perspective.
                            (The Secretary said he of course did not have Tunisia in mind in
                            referring to the weaknesses of our aid programs which we are trying to
                            correct elsewhere. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr.,
                            regretted that Tunisia some-times had to pay the price for those
                            failings of other US beneficiaries which so irritate the US
                            Congress.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, having given this background, he wanted it to be
                            clear that we were not backing away from our global responsibilities or
                            our interest in the welfare of our friends. In Tunisia's particular case
                            there was a strong feeling of friendship on our part—and we wanted to
                            help where we could. A security commitment, as the Foreign Minister
                            already recognized, was hardly a realistic possibility. It was unlikely
                            Congress would ratify such a commitment. But we do want to show our
                            support for Tunisia in other ways: first, by reaffirming our support;
                            second, by moving from words to deeds that will help relieve the anxiety
                            the Foreign Minister described; third, by reviewing our <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance and doing what we can to
                            help in this area. (The Secretary asked at this point whether there was
                            one particular concrete thing more than any other that we could do now
                            to be helpful. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>,Jr.,
                            disclaimed competence in the military field but after reflecting for a
                            second cited the radar possibility.) The Secretary said he understood
                            that Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            and his colleagues would be going into the Tunisian <gloss

                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by saying that he hoped to see
                            the Foreign Minister in New York and that we were also hoping, if the
                            schedules could be worked out, to arrange an appointment for the Foreign
                            Minister with the President.</p>

                        <p>The President referred to the recent change of regime in Libya. The
                            Tunisian Foreign Secretary said the first impressions of the new regime
                            were not particularly encouraging. Some of its pronouncements sounded
                            Bathist. The coup had happened almost too quickly. Libya was perhaps due
                            for a change but now the danger was that the pendulum would swing <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d142-02" facs="d142-02"/>too far in the other
                            direction. Tunisia had hoped Libya would remain a no-man's land, a
                            buffer zone between Tunisia and the radical governments to the East but
                            now Tunisia had much reason to be concerned. The race for influence in
                            Libya was on - Iraq, Syria, Egypt would all try to influence Libya's new
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the attitudes of Tunisian youth - did they
                            continue to feel strongly about the Palestine refugee problem, for
                            example? <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr, confirmed
                            that the Middle East question was capable of arousing emotions in
                            Tunisia. The President recalled that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> had spoken to him in 1957
                            about the problem of Egyptian teachers exported throughout the Arab
                            world. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr. agreed that
                            they had been an unhelpful factor - Tunisia had never been willing to
                            receive any, and even Algeria found it had to get rid of those it had
                            admitted.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said it was
                            unfortunate Tunisia had not been a major beneficiary of the large oil
                            discoveries in North Africa, but he was nevertheless encouraged to learn
                            that Tunisia was going forward with its development. He understood that
                            the Foreign Minister had had discussions with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> about the problem of the
                            Tunisian armed forces. The President said he would like to ask frankly
                            whether Tunisia faced a serious problem of internal security. Was the
                            problem increased by the new situation along the Libyan border?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr. answered that of
                            course there was some grumbling, as in every country, but the Tunisian
                            government kept a careful eye on public opinion and was trying to keep
                            domestic unrest within bounds. Recently, for example, it had “changed
                            gears” on its program of cooperatives because public opinion was not yet
                            ready to tolerate too rapid an advance in this respect. Tunisia was not
                            dogmatic in its policies, but pragmatic.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to speak in candor about the problem of arms
                            deliveries. This was an issue which of course raised domestic
                            difficulties for us. Yet here was a country like Tunisia which had
                            always placed the emphasis on civil authority and which had never sought
                            an arms capacity directed against anyone else. We had appreciated
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s great
                            courage in speaking out forthrightly on the great issues of the day -
                            even when this was not always the popular thing to do at the moment and
                            sometimes not even a matter of direct importance to Tunisia. He could
                            instead have taken the popular and demagogic position.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d142-03" facs="d142-03"/>
                        <p>The President said he felt it was important therefore that Tunisia have
                            what it really needs and that the United States do what it reasonably
                            could to help meet these needs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> confirmed the
                            President's impression that the question of additional arms aid was
                            already under review in Washington as a result of the conversation he
                            had had earlier this week with the Tunisian Foreign Minister and that we
                            were hopeful of some kind of answer for the Foreign Minister before he
                            leaves this country. The Secretary added that he felt that the matter of
                            military assistance was important for the reasons already given but also
                            as a boost to the morale of the Tunisian people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr. readily agreed.
                            Tunisia, he said, was like the piece of ham in a sandwich. The ham
                            needed a bone - a deterrent to anyone who tried to gobble it up.</p>
                        <p>The President said additional arms aid was likely to cause us a political
                            problem here, but the Administration was prepared to cope with it. The
                            President said he felt it very important that the nations of the world,
                            like Tunisia, which presented no military threat to anyone and which
                            were trying to live decently, not be allowed to fall because of
                            inadequate defensive means. Their peoples must have sufficient
                            confidence that their security requirements are being met so that they
                            can successfully pursue their constructive peace-time goals.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented on what he called the terribly difficult
                            problem of the Middle East. He said we know that the Middle East
                            question presents a very special difficulty for those countries living
                            in that general part of the world. We are trying our best to be fair and
                            to find some basis for settlement. He could not be very optimistic at
                            the moment about the outlook, but on the other hand we cannot give up
                            trying to find a solution. If the Foreign Minister found a good
                            solution, he should certainly let us know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr. said he would be
                            failing his duty to be frank, as friend to friend, if he did not warn
                            that some of the comments on the Middle East in the President's General
                            Assembly speech today would be badly received by the Arabs. Some of the
                            phrases would seem to them to be leaning to the side of the Israelis.
                            For example, the President had said that the 1967 resolution “maps the
                            way” to a settlement. This would sound to Arab ears like the Israeli
                            thesis that the resolution is only a start. The Secretary said there is
                            quite a difference between a “start” and something <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d142-04" facs="d142-04"/>that “maps the way”. The latter
                            implies a great deal more about the guidelines for negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The President noted we had already had a complaint from the Israelis
                            about his statement that there should not be any substantial change of
                            the borders. This was a very significant part of his comments. We
                            believe in the 1967 resolution. There is no doubt that there is a lot
                            more to be spelled out and of course it takes two to make an agreement.
                            But the resolution “maps” the trip to be taken. Now it is necessary for
                            the parties to take it. We are trying hard to be fair to both sides and
                            to stay in the middle. We earnestly seek peace in the area and the
                            Tunisian Foreign Minister could reassure his reasonable Arab colleagues
                            of our intentions. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr.
                            remarked that unfortunately there were fewer and fewer falling in this
                            category.</p>
                        <p>In closing, the Tunisian Foreign Secretary congratulated the President
                            for the courageous stand he had taken in his speech not only on Vietnam
                            but also on the Chinese question.</p>

                            <item>As each post is aware, the Tunisian Government, following the
                                September 1 Libyan coup, approached the British, French, Italians
                                and ourselves with a request for help and reassurance. The Tunisian
                                Foreign Minister extended his appeal to representatives of other
                                NATO countries at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. On
                                September 17 Secretary General Brosio convened informally at Italy's
                                request the NATO Permanent Representatives of France, Italy, the
                                United Kingdom and United States to consider Tunisia's demarche.
                                They came to an understanding that Tunisia's concerns should not be
                                a subject of NATO consideration and could be more usefully discussed
                                between Tunisia's friends. Accordingly, Italy suggested a
                                multilateral ambassadorial meeting in Rome and invited the United
                                States, Germany, France, Turkey and the United Kingdom. We demurred,
                                feeling such a meeting could become public knowledge and thereby be
                                misinterpreted, Equally while we did not rule out an eventual
                                multilateral discussion, we felt preparatory bilateral exchanges
                                were required to establish the ground rules and provide some
                                indication on how forthcoming each participant intended to be.
                                France, Germany and eventually Turkey agreed to the bilateral
                                exchange. We believe Italy and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>

                                    >Rogers</persName> had asserted that “The US is not pro-anybody'

                                of Israel in his own December 9 speech. The Tunisian Foreign
                                Minister “remarked that indeed the Secretary's speech of December 9
                                had opened hopes. It was a shame that President <persName

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had cabled a
                            report to you on his visit to Tunisia. (Tab A) He was warmly received
                            and seems to have had useful meetings with key Tunisian officials. He
                            feels that we have a “sincere friend” in Tunisia that “deserves our
                            help.”</p>
                        <p>Discussion of bilateral relations was “relatively brief.” Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., did, however,
                            lay “great stress” on Tunisia's close relations with us. The Prime
                            Minister specifically made the point that this was “not dependent on
                            personalities, but was the conviction of the Government.” The Foreign
                            Minister said that Tunisia never confused Arab differences with the U.S.
                            on the Middle East with our basic friendship.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> found the
                            Tunisians preoccupied about the Middle East situation. In a frank and
                            lively discussion with the Foreign Minister and other members of the
                            Cabinet, the Secretary presented our views on the Middle East. They
                            spoke in public favorably about Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>' December 9 speech. In common with Morocco and
                            Algeria, the Tunisians took a position favoring the Palestinians. The
                            Foreign Minister strongly maintained that the Soviets want neither war
                            nor peace in the Middle East and would prevent <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from establishing peace.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisians are also extremely worried about the course of events in
                            Libya. They believe that the Egyptians are fully dominating the Libyan
                            Government. They were not, however, particularly worried about the
                            French sale of jet aircraft to Libya, since the French had assured them
                            that France had “absolute guarantees” that the planes would not be used
                            against Libya's western neighbors, and, in any event, the Tunisians
                            noted that they could not yet be flown anyway.</p>
                        <p>On Vietnam, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> included in his formal toast for public
                            release a plea for peace based almost exactly on our policy.</p>

                                the foreign affairs portfolio in June, Tunisia has moved quite
                                quickly to reassert its non-aligned standing and harmonize its
                                foreign policy with prevailing Arab and “third world” attitudes,
                                from which it has kept its distance over much of the past

                            <p>We need not regard the change as inevitably unfavorable to us.
                                Normalization of relations with Arab and Third World nations could
                                reduce Tunisia's vulnerability and —-conversely —our need to
                                underwrite many of Tunisia's needs precisely because it has isolated
                                itself from so many of its neighbors and peers.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>—in the attached
                            memorandum—would like you to be aware of some strains that are
                            developing in our relationship with Tunisia, a country that has your
                            special interest.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisians are concerned over the appearance of our declining ability
                            to meet their development and security requirements. Last September,
                            after the Libyan coup, you indicated to <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>'s son, then Foreign Minister, that we would be
                            as forthcoming as possible with economic and military assistance in view
                            of our continued interest in Tunisia's progress and security. The
                            Tunisians considered this a morale boost at that time. However, it is
                            becoming increasingly evident that we may not be able to provide the
                            $9.2 million in concessional food sales nor provide significant
                            additional military assistance that Tunisia requires. In fact, needs in
                            Southeast Asia will require us to reduce our $3.0 million in military
                            assistance for Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia has been a loyal companion since the beginning of our assistance
                            relationship after their independence in 1956. The Tunisian leadership
                            is now looking upon anticipating reductions as a precursor of a changed
                            U.S. attitude. The Secretary feels that—despite some necessary cuts that
                            may have to be made—it is not in our interest to convey the impression
                            that we are backing away from our traditionally close assistance
                            relationship with Tunisia. He has instructed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to press home in Tunis
                            reassurances of our interest and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> plans to do the same when he sees the Foreign
                            Minister at the United Nations sessions. The Secretary also feels that
                            it might be desirable at some future point for you to inform President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> that our
                            reductions—necessitated by our world-wide obligations—will be kept to a
                            minimum to account for <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>our
                            strong interest in Tunisia's development. He is not recommending that
                            this action be taken at this juncture but wanted you to be aware that
                            such a situation might arise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Comment</hi>: Tunisia is an example of how the
                            small countries often get squeezed when the high-priority ones are taken
                            care of in our military and economic assistance programs. Also, Tunisia
                            is a country which is broadening its natural economic relationship with
                            Western Europe and still needs U.S. aid. The result is that the U.S.
                            spends its money where it is more exclusively depended upon.</p>
                        <p>I share the Secretary's concern about this friendly country's receiving
                            wrong impressions of our policy. In addition to the Secretary's
                            recommendations I am having my staff work with State to see what else
                            might be done.</p>

                        <list>

                                East but everything depends on the U.S. and Israel. The U.S. will
                                have to press the Israelis to be more forthcoming if there is to be
                                chance for peace settlement.</item>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>
                            <item>—Any peace settlement must take fully into account the desires of
                                the Palestinians. The Arabs, Israelis and the U.S. must recognize
                                the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and make provision for a
                                “Palestinian homeland” if any peace settlement is to stick over the
                                long term.</item>
                            <item>—He feels very strongly that our presence in the Mediterranean
                                should remain and not be decreased. His main concern is the growing
                                soviet role and presence.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>More specifically—though he will probably not mention this to you—Tunisia
                            is concerned with the declining level of U.S. economic assistance [they
                            want more <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>480 than we have been able to
                            promise] and U.S. inability to provide anything like the kind of
                            military assistance they would like. [They have a shopping list worth
                            $50-60 million, and our whole <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            appropriation for all Africa is only $20 million with $3 million
                            programmed for Tunisia.]</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Talking Points</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We understand the point that President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> and the Foreign Minister have made—that
                            legitimate Palestinian concerns must be met if there is to be a lasting
                            peace settlement. What we still have difficulty understanding is exactly
                            how the Tunisians envision a process that could take Palestinian
                            concerns into account. For instance:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—What do the Palestinians want that is achievable? [They say they
                                want a binational Palestine, but that seems unlikely to happen. What
                                can they honorably settle for?]</item>
                            <item>—How do Palestinian aspirations and the future of Jordan
                                relate?</item>
                            <item>—Who can speak for all the Palestinians? Do the fedayeen leaders
                                fairly represent them?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>2. The U.S. tried to demonstrate in September that it remains actively
                            and intimately concerned with the preservation of freedom in the
                            Mediterranean.</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>—How does the Minister see European participation in this process
                                evolving?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>3. The U.S. wants to continue working with Tunisia in the military and
                            economic assistance fields to the extent our resources permit. The
                            Minister understands the difficulties the Administration has in getting
                            adequate appropriations from the Congress. Tunisia should understand
                            that the level of assistance that is possible is not a measure of the
                            Administration's attitude toward Tunisia. [You may recall that the
                            President in his talk with their Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., a year ago at the

                            military assistance needs.]</p>

                        <p>After exchanging greetings with his visitor, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that he was aware
                            of his conversation with the Secretary of State and with his views in
                            general. The Foreign Minister then proceeded to cover the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>He explained the role Tunisia had been called upon to play and how
                            important it was for the US to support it in its present role. First
                            called “traitors” by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            because they had advocated calm and reason, the Tunisians had recently
                            seen their position vindicated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> himself, who, a few days before he died, had
                            stated categorically that he did not want war and that the Tunisians had
                            been right in the stand they had taken.</p>
                        <p>The growing Soviet presence in the Mediterranean was a cause of deep
                            preoccupation. The Soviets now openly declare themselves “a
                            Mediterranean power” by virtue of the Mediterranean Sea being an
                            extension of the Black Sea. He recalled that a few years ago the French
                            would dismiss any remark about Soviet penetration into the Mediterranean
                            and would refer to that presence as short-term and temporary.</p>
                        <p>He emphasized the need for the United States to focus on the central idea
                            of a settlement and not become obsessed with details. He cautioned us
                            against engaging in a step-by-step escalation supplying weapons to the
                            Israelis because the Egyptians had moved missiles. This escalation could
                            only lead to ultimate folly.</p>

                        <p>He was proud that Tunisia had been able to introduce a new approach; a
                            new method of work, and that other Arabs listened to Tunisia and
                            responded to this calm approach.</p>

                            </hi> said that he had followed every point the Minister had made so far
                            except one. Why was it incomprehensible that we would like to maintain
                            an agreement that we had proposed in the first place and that we had
                            every reason to believe had been accepted by the UAR? When he had first
                            heard of the violations of the standstill agreement he had not believed
                            them because he could not believe that any country would engage so soon
                            in violations of those agreements. He had studied the evidence. The
                            Secretary of State had spent five hours reviewing the evidence and there
                            was absolutely no doubt that there had been massive violations. Thus,
                            why was it difficult to understand that we wanted to maintain this
                            agreement that we had initiated?</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="underline">Foreign Minister</hi> responded by restating his
                            argument on the perils of escalation and on the importance for the
                            United States to view the overall idea of a settlement rather than
                            focusing on details such as getting the Israelis to accept indirect
                            negotiations, to use or not to use the term “withdrawal”; all these were
                            details.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Palestinian aspects, he stressed that no settlement can be
                            arrived at without a settlement of the Palestinian question. This
                            included secure and guaranteed borders for a Palestinian entity.</p>

                            borders. The Foreign Minister replied that Jordan would become what it
                            had been in the past— “Trans-Jordan.” He urged the US to be more
                            understanding toward the Palestinians and stressed that in his view El
                            Fatah was the responsible party with whom to open an eventual
                            dialogue.</p>

                            how valuable it was for him to have had the benefit of the Minister's
                            advice and counsel. The Minister should be assured that we share the
                            basic principles he had outlined. We also want peace in the Middle East
                            to be established for several generations. We want to encourage
                            moderates like Tunisia in their development without the pressures and
                            the tensions under which they labor at present. We want to work usefully
                            for peace and our ideas and objectives are very very close to the
                            Minister's own.</p>

                                SUPERIMPOSED ON THIS CONDITION NOW IS ORGANIC BRAIN DISEASE,

                                DEPICTS HIMSELF, WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, AS A MODERN ATLAS HOLDING
                                UP TUNISIA. HE IS IN A VERY EMOTIONAL STATE, TEARS FLOW FREQUENTLY,
                                AND HE FREQUENTLY USES WORDS SUCH AS “TRISTE” (SAD), “FATIGUE”
                                (TIRED) AND “FAIBLE” (WEAK) AND REFERS TO TUNISIANS AS HIS CHILDREN.
                                HE REFERRED TO BEING SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND “TRAITORS,” HARPING
                                AT LENGTH ON THE PERFIDIOUS BEN SALAH, AND “DIVISIONS” AHEAD. THE
                                PRESIDENT CONSTANTLY RETURNS TO THE PAST AND EXCULPATES HIMSELF OF
                                ALL WRONGS, AND CREDITS HIMSELF WITH ALL THE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS
                                IN RECENT TUNISIAN HISTORY.</item>

                                HAD DONE IN THIS EMERGENCY, HE THEN SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE UNITED

                                IN PROVIDING THE TRANSPORTATION. UNDER SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONING, HE
                                INDICATED THAT THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ALL THE EXPENSES.

                                TALKED WITH DOCTORS BARNES AND MAGAL. THEY CONFIRMED THAT ALL THE
                                DOCTORS, TUNISIAN, FRENCH, SWISS, AND U.S., AFTER MEETING WITH
                                PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName>, HAD
                                PREPARED A BRIEF, SIGNED STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY AGREED UNANIMOUSLY
                                THAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDED FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC EXAMINATION AND
                                TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF TUNISIA. IN THIS BULLETIN THE DOCTORS EXPRESSED
                                PREFERENCE FOR SUCH TESTING IN THE UNITED STATES. (DRS. BARNES AND
                                MAGAL EMPHASIZED THAT, DESPITE THEIR TACTFUL EFFORTS, THE TUNISIANS
                                WOULD NOT BE DISSUADED FROM THEIR DECISION THAT PRESIDENT <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName> SHOULD GO TO THE UNITED
                                STATES FOR TREATMENT.) THE DOCTORS FELT HE NEEDED A COMPLETE CHANGE
                                OF ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, THE DECISION ABOUT WHERE THE PRESIDENT
                                SHOULD GO FOR THIS TREATMENT WAS SPECIFICALLY LEFT TO THE FAMILY.
                                THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NOT WANTED <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                    >BOURGUIBA</persName> TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY—HE FELT IT WOULD BE
                                BAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS—NOR DID MRS. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                    >BOURGUIBA</persName> AT FIRST, BUT THEY ALL AGREED IN THE END,
                                AFTER CONSULTING THE PRESIDENT A SECOND TIME, THAT THE UNITED STATES
                                WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE WHERE HE COULD OBTAIN THE FINEST EXPERTISE.
                                IN THE END, THEY WERE GUIDED BY WHAT THEY FELT WAS BEST FOR THE
                                PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT HAD TOLD THEM, “HE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET
                                BETTER.”</item>

                                WALTER REED, BUT HE DID NOT ASK FOR THIS DIRECTLY. HE ONLY ASKED FOR
                                ASSISTANCE IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CENTER WHERE HE
                                MIGHT GO, PRIVATE OR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, AND FOR

                            <item>THE MANNER IN WHICH WE RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST IS VERY IMPORTANT.
                                IN MY OPINION, IT SHOULD BE QUICK, POSITIVE AND GENEROUS. I DO NOT
                                WANT TO DWELL ON THE OBVIOUS. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"

                                THAT THERE MAY BE ULTIMATELY SOME CRITICISM OF THE U.S. IF HE
                                FOLLOWS THE SAME COURSE AS MONGI SLIM, THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE

                        <p>As you know, President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            was recently at <persName>Walter</persName> Reed Hospital for diagnosis
                            of his deteriorating brain condition and is now undergoing treatment in
                            Switzerland. He is not mortally ill, but there is little prospect that
                            he will be able to resume his duties except, at most, on a part time and
                            largely ceremonial basis. Below just for background are a few comments
                            on the elements in the situation in Tunisia and the eventual possible
                            implications for our bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Succession Problem</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Until now in Tunisia political power has been highly centralized and
                            personalized in <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>. The
                            people and institutions under him have been of only secondary
                            importance. Fortunately, <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                            >Bourguiba</persName>'s decline has been gradual and this has given him
                            and the other leaders some chance to focus on the succession
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>At <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s initiative the
                            constitution was amended last year to provide for the automatic
                            succession of the Prime Minister should the President die, resign or
                            become incapacitated. Then in early February, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> proposed, presumably with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s approval, a new
                            procedure for selecting a successor. Under the new measures a
                            Presidential vacancy would be filled by the President of the National
                            Assembly for “a few weeks,” during which time he would be required to
                            arrange for National Presidential elections in which he could not
                            himself be a candidate.</p>
                        <p>Other pending amendments to the constitution would circumscribe the
                            authority of the President by increasing the powers of the Prime
                            Minister and National Assembly. They would, for instance, give the now
                            relatively powerless National Assembly the right under certain as yet
                            unspecified circumstances to force the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to
                            resign.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d152-02" facs="d152-02"/>
                        <p>The National Assembly has now appointed a special commission to study the
                            proposals, which are the result of extensive deliberation by the
                            Tunisian leadership over the past eight months. It is expected that the
                            measures will be passed with few if any changes, although the process
                            can not be completed before mid-May at the earliest.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Even if the transfer of power and democratization measures go smoothly,
                            we must expect some modification of the relationship between the United
                            States and Tunisia. Much of the parallelism between Tunisia and U.S.
                            foreign policy and friendship for the U.S. has stemmed from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> personally. He has viewed the
                            U.S. as a powerful friend in the strategic North Africa-Mediterranean
                            area and one that has stood by Tunisia in its numerous quarrels with the
                            French and has contributed to Tunisia's economic development.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s political heir or
                            heirs are less likely to feel the same personal sense of attachment for
                            the U.S. Moreover, none of them—<persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName>, former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LB1"

                                >Masmoudi</persName>, or Minister of Interior Ahmed Mestri—has
                            either the personality or prestige that would make it possible for him
                            fully to withstand domestic and Arab pressures for a more “Arab” policy
                            on the Middle East and more non-alignment on other issues of importance
                            to us. On the other hand, the new leadership is not likely to respond to
                            Soviet blandishments, although any further reductions in our economic
                            and military aid will make it more difficult for Tunisia to resist
                            Soviet offers.</p>
                        <p>In short, a shift in political forces is already underway and with it a
                            change in the tone of our relationship. In this process, the Tunisians
                            may begin to gradually adopt more positions at variance with ours, both
                            on regional and wider international issues. However, barring a major
                            revolution in Tunisia, which nobody for sees, the chances are that the
                            Tunisians will continue to want a relationship with the U.S. Even if
                            they do not, Tunisia can not damage U.S. interests in the Mediterranean.
                            We have no economic interests there and no military interests. What is
                            likely to happen when <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            goes is that we will drift into a new relationship rather than finding
                            ourselves precipitated into one.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You may recall that when the President saw former Tunisian Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr. in New
                            York at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in September 1969, he
                            assured him that the U.S. would do what it reasonably could to help meet
                            Tunisia's defense needs.</p>
                        <p>Doing this has been a continuing struggle because of the low overall
                            ceiling imposed in the Foreign Assistance Act on military assistance to
                            Africa and the need to recognize that Tunisia's economy will not support
                            a large defense establishment. Therefore, our programmers have had to
                            work at levels well below what the military planners might design even
                            as a minimal defense force for Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>At present, the military assistance programmers are working within the
                            concept of a $45 million package over 5 years—this representing not the
                            amount of money we can provide but the value of the equipment that
                            Tunisia might try to procure from all sources.</p>
                        <p>In the attached memorandum and telegram, State and Defense seek clearance
                            on a telegram informing the Tunisians that we have been able to add $1
                            million to the present $3 million program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1971. Within that ceiling, the Tunisians would make
                            their own choices between items earlier programmed and new items
                            available, including some M-48 tanks, medium helicopters, mortars and
                            anti-aircraft artillery.</p>
                        <p>The particular reason for seeking White House clearance on the attached
                            package is that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>,
                            in order to make the most of this modest increase, has decided to send a
                            personal message to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Masmoudi</persName>. In that message he would recall the
                            President's earlier expression of “full sympathy with Tunisia's
                            sustained efforts to <pb n="2" xml:id="d153-02" facs="d153-02"/>achieve
                            its economic and social development goals in an atmosphere of peace and
                            security.” The most significant statement in this message is in the next
                            to last paragraph of the message [bottom of page 3 in the first telegram
                            attached to the Eliot to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> memorandum]. This assures the Foreign Minister
                            “on behalf of the President that he remains personally interested in
                            Tunisia's security and that the United States will do what it can,
                            within the limits imposed by available resources, to assist in its sound
                            development.” The statement of personal “interest in Tunisia's security”
                            has over the years represented the extent to which we have been willing
                            to go in response to Tunisia's request for a special security
                            relationship with the United States. This says neither more nor less
                            than has been said before.</p>

                            <item>Because of overall U.S. political and military interests in the
                                Mediterranean, Tunisia's strategic position, flanking the Sicilian
                                straits, is important to the United States and NATO, especially in
                                the event of non-nuclear or nuclear war on a limited scale. Access
                                to Tunisian ports for recreation purposes by the Sixth Fleet has
                                also supported U.S. political-military and intelligence
                                objectives.</item>

                            <item>Tunisia's emphasis on economic development offers a market for
                                U.S. goods, services, and possibly, a field for private investment.
                                The internal market would be limited, however, owing to Tunisia's
                                restricted resource base and relatively small purchasing

                                BUT FEAR WAR IS ONLY OUTLET IF THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE. EGYPT WAS
                                DISAPPOINTED WITH RECENT MEETING BETWEEN RIAD AND SECRETARY,
                                ACCORDING TO <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName>, AND
                                CAIRO NOW FEELS CONDEMNED TO DO SOMETHING. ARABS ARE TALKING ABOUT

                                SUFFER MANY DEFEATS BUT THAT ISRAEL CANNOT SURVIVE ONE.</item>

                            <item>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">ROGERS</persName> SAID U.S.
                                CAN DO NOTHING IF ARABS DECIDE ON WAR, BUT THAT A POLICY OF COURTING
                                DEFEAT IS NO POLICY. THE U.S. CAN RE HELPFUL IN BRINGING ABOUT A
                                SOLUTION IN WHICH ARABS WILL GET ALMOST EVERYTHING THEY WANT. OUR
                                POLICY IS QUITE FAVORABLE TO THE ARABS AND THAT IS WHY IT IS
                                CRITICIZED BY ISRAEL. THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION HAS CHANGED THE
                                U.S. POLICY OF THREE YEARS AGO AND THE ARABS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS
                                AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. WE OFFER POSSIBILITY OF PEACE, WITH ARABS
                                OBTAINING ALMOST ALL THEY ASK FOR. SOVIETS TELL ARABS TO HOLD OUT
                                FOR EVERYTHING THEY DEMAND AND OFFER NO ALTERNATIVE EXCEPT STALEMATE
                                AND WAR. PROLONGATION OF PRESENT STATUS PLAYS INTO ISRAELI HANDS AND
                                INTERIM SETTLEMENT WHICH WE FEEL CAN BE ACHIEVED IS MORE IN INTEREST
                                OF ARABS THAN ISRAELIS. INTERIM AGREEMENT SHOULD BE STEP TOWARD
                                FINAL SETTLEMENT BUT IT CANNOT SPELL OUT EXACTLY WHAT FINAL
                                AGREEMENT WILL BE, OR THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR INTERIM STEP. THE
                                U.S. POSITION IS THAT ISRAEL SHOULD RETURN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL
                                OCCUPIED TERRITORIES EXCEPT FOR SOME MINOR SECURITY ADJUSTMENTS SUCH
                                AS THE PROBLEM OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AND SHARM EL SHEIKH. SECRETARY
                                SAID HE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED WITH SADAT AND BELIEVES INTERIM
                                AGREEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED WHICH WOULD BENEFIT EGYPT WITHOUT
                                PREJUDICING FINAL SETTLEMENT BUT THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE IF ARABS
                                ASK FOR EVERYTHING THEY WANT PRIOR TO AN INTERIM ACCORD. AS IN CASE
                                OF BERLIN AGREEMENT, SECRETARY POINT OUT THAT SOME THINGS CAN BE
                                SETTLED WHILE OTHERS ARE NEGOTIATED LATER.</item>

                                FORESAW LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY PROGRESS UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS
                                AND EXPECTED THAT THE STALEMATE WOULD CONTINUE WITH INTERMITTENT
                                TALKS AND SKIRMISHES. HE THEN RAISED BRIEFLY THE PROBLEM OF

                            <item>THE SECRETARY RECALLED THAT WE SUPPORTED THE ARAB POSITION ON

                                WISHED TO MAKE PROGRESS. IT SEEMED TO US THAT EGYPT WOULD BE BETTER
                                OFF WITH THE CANAL OPEN AND SUCH A MOVE COULD LEAD TO

                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s rule has been
                            pragmatic, paternalistic, highly personal, and autocratic. He wants to
                            ensure a niche in history as the creator of a stable and respected
                            nation-state. For the past decade he has time and again vacillated over
                            the succession problem, but he has been reluctant to relax the reins of
                            authority.</p>

                        <p>1. Assessing Tunisia's body politic requires insight into the personality
                            of its chief architect, who calls himself the “supreme combatant.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> was born in
                            1903 at Monastir in the heart of the Sahel, a rich agricultural plain of
                            eastern Tunisia which produced most of the country's pre-independence
                            political leaders, bureaucrats, and intellectuals. He entered politics
                            in the late 1920s after completing his education in French schools in
                            Tunis and France. With other young intellectuals, almost all educated in
                            France, he sought to revitalize the nationalist, but cautious, Destour
                            (constitution) party that represented the interests of the small
                            Tunisian bourgeoisie and landed gentry.</p>
                        <p>2. These efforts failed, and in 1934 <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> and his peers broke away from the Destour to
                            form the Neo-Destour party, now called the Destourian Socialist Party.
                            The new party sought a mass, rather than a select, membership. During
                            his first 20 years, the party was more often than not suppressed and,
                            operating clandestinely, evolved into a highly disciplined organization.
                            In 1938 <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> became the
                            second president of the party, but spent most of the years until 1956 in
                            prison or in exile.</p>
                        <p>3. France's policy of repressing Tunisian nationalism was modified in
                            1954. From his prison cell, <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> welcomed Premier Mendes-France's promise of
                            self-government. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s
                            counsel to the Tunisian team during the arduous negotiations resulted in
                            Tunisia's acceptance of limited autonomy, an admitted half loaf but
                            better than none to <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>. He
                            was permitted to return home in mid-1955 to a hero's welcome. Nine
                            months later, after Morocco had gained independence, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> persuaded France to give
                            Tunisia its independence also. He became the first post-independence
                            prime minister, and in July 1957, when the constituent assembly
                            proclaimed Tunisia a republic, he was selected as the country's
                            provisional president. Since the constitution was adopted in 1959,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> has been <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d156-05" facs="d156-05"/>re-elected for three five-year
                            terms. His present and constitutionally last term expires in November
                            1974; he is publicly committed to retire at that time.</p>
                        <p>4. When <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> took charge of
                            the-government in April 1956, he faced the familiar problems of any
                            small country with few natural resources. Most of Tunisia's wealth was
                            held by foreigners. The vast majority of its 3.5 million people was
                            illiterate and existed at subsistence level. A rebellion against foreign
                            rule in Algeria that raged along Tunisia's western border brought
                            serious problems; armed Algerian guerrillas who took refuge in Tunisia
                            and hundreds of thousands of Algerian refugees. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s open resistance to the
                            extension of Nasir's influence into North Africa, his avowedly
                            anti-Communist position, and his outspoken support of the West were
                            politically hazardous in the milieu of a newly independent Arab country.
                            Faced with profound ignorance, poverty, xenophobia, and the opposition
                            of Pan-Arabists and religious traditionalists, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> sought to improve living
                            conditions—particularly housing—expand and modernize education, train
                            cadres for both business and government, create more efficient public
                            and private enterprises, modernize and diversify agriculture, and
                            improve the quality of family life and the status of women.</p>

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s philosophy of
                            government has been strongly influenced by his French education and
                            early association with European socialists and liberals. Basically a
                            humanist, he rejected Marxism and embraced a socialism designed to
                            promote the self-development of individuals. His avowed goal is the
                            creation of a fundamentally egalitarian and modern society, a “showcase
                            of democracy.”</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d156-06" facs="d156-06"/>
                        <p>6. In pursuit of this goal he has confronted the entrenched interests of
                            foreign businesses and landowners, and the rich and powerful Tunisian
                            families of the royal court. His programs to modernize Tunisian society
                            have frequently run counter to Islamic practices and have often been
                            greeted with suspicion, superstition, or apathy by the impoverished and
                            ignorant. He restrained supporters who wanted to expel all foreigners.
                            In maintaining a balance between divergent pressures, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> employed the techniques he had
                            used in winning independence—to press forward; to be conciliatory,
                            persuasive and patient; and if necessary, to back off until he could go
                            forward again.</p>
                        <p>7. Although he publicly advocates democracy, <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> in fact has maintained tight control over the
                            government and party, making all major and many minor decisions and
                            appointments. Tunisian democracy, he explains, must be guided carefully
                            because the people still are politically immature. [<hi rend="italic"

                            has suffered, and the party has lost much of its earlier vitality. Both
                            government and party have had difficulty in attracting intellectuals and

                            been synonymous; key party leaders have held the key offices in both the
                            party's executive body—the political bureau—and the government. Many
                            party leaders particularly at the local and regional level had initially
                            been elected to office. As time went on <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> began to select them himself. Dissent was
                            discouraged. Anyone who persisted in opposing or failed to execute a
                            specific policy could expect dismissal from the government and the
                            party. Although no formal censorship has been instituted, the press and
                            the other news media have become uniformly uncritical of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> and those surrounding him.
                            When the press speaks harshly of an official, it is likely that he is
                            either facing early oblivion or has already been dismissed.</p>
                        <p>9. The cliques that are common within the monolithic political structure
                            generally follow regional, ideological, and generation lines. The two
                            dominant regional divisions are the Sahelians—inhabitants of the coastal
                            area of eastern Tunisia where the party was formed and which supplied
                            the early cadre—and the Tunisois—people born and living in or near the
                            capital. The ideological split is between the conservatives
                            (absolutists) who favor the retention of a strong, centralized authority
                            and a controlled economy, and the liberals (reformists) who call for a
                            more democratic party and government, relaxation of controls, and a
                            freer economy. A generation gap exists between members of the party who
                            were active in the thirties and forties and were imprisoned for their
                            political activities and members born after about 1935. The older ones
                            tend to be Sahelians and conservatives; the younger, Tunisois and
                            liberal.</p>
                        <p>10. Since independence nearly 16 years ago, a whole new generation of
                            Tunisians, better educated than their fathers, have entered the ranks of
                            the party and bureaucracy. Most of them chafe under the regime's
                            authoritarian and paternalistic practices. Many who supported the theory
                            behind the <pb n="8" xml:id="d156-08" facs="d156-08"/>formation of
                            business, service and agricultural cooperatives begun during the 1960s
                            were troubled by the fact many cooperatives were imposed without the
                            consent of the participants.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">AHMED MESTIRI</persName>, a member of this
                            new generation, is the most prominent of Tunisia's liberals. He made his
                            initial bid to rally support against forced cooperativization in January
                            1968. He was able to elicit only limited backing and publicly resigned
                            as secretary of state for defense to dramatize his opposition. He was
                            expelled from the party. Two years later, after the imposition of
                            agricultural cooperatives was stepped up and aroused such widespread
                            opposition that the policy had to be dropped, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Mestiri</persName> was reintegrated into the party. He then helped
                            formulate the program of expanding the authority of government and
                            assembly announced by <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> in
                            June 1970. As executive secretary of the party's Superior Commission
                            which was charged with drafting constitutional amendments and preparing
                            for the quinquennial congress this fall, he was in an excellent position
                            to press for changes in the system.</p>
                        <p>12. When the 1,000-member party congress was finally held in October, a
                            groundswell of support for more democracy in the party and government
                            became evident. After unexpectedly free discussion the delegates elected
                            liberals to fill a majority of seats in the party's 58-member central
                            committee. It was clear that most of the delegates were seeking new
                            institutions and the free election of his successor when the ailing
                            President steps down.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>, however, backed by
                            the Sahelian conservative minority, blocked this trend. Although a
                            majority of the delegates had endorsed a proposal to change the existing
                            procedure by which the prime minister would succeed to the presidency in
                            the event of a vacancy, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            announced that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName> was his choice as successor. <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="d156-09" facs="d156-09"/>In spite of the clear consensus
                            that the congress should elect the political bureau, the President
                            announced he intended to appoint its members. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Mestiri</persName> aired his frustrations to the foreign press, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> suspended him from
                            party activities. Ultimately <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> submitted a handpicked slate of 20 candidates
                            to the central committee from which it elected the 14-man political
                            bureau. The result was a largely conservative body. Even some liberals
                            have criticized Mestiri for committing the unpardonable sin of
                            discussing internal affairs with foreign press representatives. He will
                            have to appear before a party disciplinary committee.</p>
                        <p>14. Despite the victory over the liberals, the ruling
                            politicians—including <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                            >Bourguiba</persName>—cannot be completely insensitive to the pressures
                            for change. The liberals still have two forums—the party's central
                            committee and the National Assembly—and they can be expected to make
                            full use of both. Most prominent liberals will continue to work for
                            evolutionary change, expecting that over the next year or so many of the
                            propositions they support will be adopted.</p>
                        <p>15. By doggedly clinging to the status quo, the conservatives may see
                            their fortunes decline still further. A leading conservative,
                            38-year-old MOHAMED SAYAH, [text not declassified] a member of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> government and reputed
                            to be a current favorite of <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>, Sayah failed to be elected to the central
                            committee and therefore was not eligible for selection to the political
                            bureau. Should <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> die or
                            his term expire coincident with an expansion of liberal influence, the
                            conservatives might try to seize power. Sayah is the only Tunisian now
                            prominent who seems ruthless enough to attempt a power grab.</p>

                        <p>16. Dissident groups outside the power structure are too small,
                            disparate, and disorganized to exert much influence on political
                            developments or to pose more than a remote threat to the country's
                            stability. Followers of Salah ben Youssef, expelled from the party in
                            1955 and murdered in 1961—presumably on <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>'s orders—have long been actively plotting from
                            exile to upset the <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            regime. There are also a few adherents of Marxism, Trotskyism, Maoism,
                            and various Pan-Arab movements. The small Tunisian Communist party,
                            banned since 1963, has an estimated 100 members. Most political exiles
                            eke out a living from small and diminishing foreign subsidies,
                            occasional handouts from sympathizers, or what wages they can earn in an
                            uncertain labor market.</p>
                        <p>17. Islam exerts a subtle moral influence in Tunisia. While emphasizing
                            Muslim moral values, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> has
                            consistently sought to eliminate religious customs that impede economic
                            modernization. His efforts have been but partially successful. His
                            campaign to downgrade the strict observance of Ramadan, the economically
                            unproductive Moslem month of daytime fasting and nighttime feasting (he
                            labeled it a luxury a developing nation could ill afford) has
                            antagonized the country's religious leaders and been openly resisted by
                            most Tunisians. Religious support is not likely to be a vital factor in
                            any power struggle, however.</p>
                        <p>18. The backing of the generally apolitical military and security forces
                            is crucial to any Tunisian government. <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> and other authorities have been careful to
                            isolate the military from politics. Despite his efforts to insulate the
                            military from politics the cleavage between liberal and conservative
                            factions has to some extent been reflected among the military officers,
                            with senior officers generally favoring the conservatives and junior
                            officers being sympathetic toward the liberals.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d156-11" facs="d156-11"/>
                        <p>19. Students, traditionally the most fractious element of Tunisian
                            society, are a most likely source of disaffection and discord. Most
                            students have resisted party control over the student union. During the
                            annual student union congress in August, a majority of the
                            delegates—including some Destourians, leftists, Communists, and Arab
                            nationalists—formed a “Democratic Front” which unsuccessfully tried to
                            take control of the organization. The new leaders, imposed by the
                            minority, can be expected to adhere to party direction, but there is a
                            real question how much of a following the organization will command
                            among the university students this year. In an effort to forestall
                            potential troubles within the university, <persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName> entered into a dialogue with student and youth
                            leaders immediately after the party congress.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>20. The overriding political issue of the day is presidential succession.
                            For more than a decade, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            has frequently referred to his mortality, but has vacillated about what
                            procedure should be followed in selecting a successor. In 1969 <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            <pb n="12" xml:id="d156-12" facs="d156-12"/>created the post of prime
                            minister and named his longtime associate, <persName corresp="#p_LB1"
                                >BAHI LADGHAM</persName>, to fill it. The National Assembly
                            subsequently amended the constitution to provide that the prime minister
                            succeed in the event of a presidential vacancy.</p>
                        <p>21. By June 1970 <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> had laid
                            down the broad outlines for constitutional revision, but he changed his
                            mind again. He proposed that the Superior Commission of the party study
                            the possibility of creating a post of vice president or of providing for
                            the temporary succession of the president of the National Assembly to
                            the presidency. That fall, he told an audience that he did not want to
                            know who was going to succeed him and that his successor should be
                            elected. A few days later he had dismissed Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName> and named another long-time
                            associate, Hedi <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>, as prime
                            minister. Since then, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            has frequently expressed full confidence in <persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName>. He told the recent congress that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> should be his successor, adding
                            that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> and
                            former interior minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Mestiri</persName>
                            could wait their turn. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            also told the party congress that he would not seek re-election when his
                            term expires. But he recently informed an American news correspondent
                            that if his health permitted he would run again in 1974.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s interventions on
                            the succession problem have complicated and delayed a solution. The
                            liberals are likely to be more determined than ever that the
                            constitution be amended to provide for an elected successor, while the
                            conservatives will no doubt continue to support <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>. Meanwhile, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>, although attempting to hew a
                            neutral course, has lost his status as an arbiter.</p>
                        <p>23. Another controversial issue involves the authority of the National
                            Assembly. The liberals and conservatives agree that Tunisia should
                            retain a strong presidential system in which the president <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="d156-13" facs="d156-13"/>establishes the broad outlines of
                            policy. They also agree that the government, appointed and responsible
                            to the President, should also be accountable to the National Assembly.
                            They disagree over a proposal giving the National Assembly the right to
                            censure the government. Only the liberal faction wants this.</p>
                        <p>24. A third issue is the relationship between the party and the various
                            national organizations: labor, students, youth, women, artisans and
                            agriculturalists. Most, if not all, of these groups have during the past
                            decade been brought under tight party supervision and control. The labor
                            and student groups, in particular, have resisted party domination and,
                            reflecting the strong popular desire for more democracy within the
                            government and party, may resume pressure for greater autonomy. There
                            will also be demands for a complete restructuring of the party as
                            outlined by <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> last year. At
                            that time he indicated that local units, or cells, would be represented
                            at all levels of the party hierarchy and that party decisions would be
                            made democratically, not dictated from the top.</p>
                        <p>25. The possibility of a multiparty political system was raised by the
                            Superior Commission last year, but apparently has been shelved. Tunisia
                            has had only one party since the small Communist Party was banned in
                            1963. <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> and most party
                            leaders continue to justify the one-party system on the ground that
                            Tunisia, a poor nation, cannot afford competition between rival
                            organizations. The watchword is still national unity within a
                            single-party system.</p>

                            received his university education in Paris. As a student, he joined the

                            Socialist Party both before and after independence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> is considered to be the source
                            of many of the moderate, pro-Western ideas adopted by <persName

                            individual initiative, he is reputed to have been prominent among those
                            who urged <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> to reverse the
                            controversial agricultural cooperative policy in 1969. He is said to be
                            scrupulously honest and refuses favors to even his closest friends. He
                            has little political base of his own.</p>

                            been the top administrator in the government from the beginning of the
                            republic and served as secretary general of the party from 1955 until he
                            was replaced by <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>. He was
                            the first chairman of the party's Superior Commission, but lost it to

                            may have been somewhat sweetened by demonstrations of support he
                            received at the party congress when he obtained the greatest number of
                            votes of any candidate for the party's central committee. The President
                            did not propose his name for the political bureau, reportedly at
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName>'s own request.</p>

                            in a Tunis suburb and received his secondary education in Tunis.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName> was largely
                            responsible for creating an effective party and a smoothly operating
                            administration. His leadership of the Jordanian-Fedayeen Conciliation
                            Mission last year won him the respect of many Arab governments. He is
                            also widely respected by the Tunisian military services.</p>

                            As foreign <pb n="16" xml:id="d156-16" facs="d156-16"/>minister, he had
                            mended Tunisia's fences with the Arab states to the east. The 47year-old
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> is reputed to be one
                            of the principal leaders of the Sahelian faction of the party and to
                            have a considerable following among students. <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Masmoudi</persName>, a protege of <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>, was educated in Tunis and the University of
                            Paris. Since Tunisia's independence, he has twice so antagonized the
                            president that <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> was
                            dismissed from his government posts and suspended from the party. The
                            most recent incident occurred in 1961 when <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Masmoudi</persName> openly criticized the developing “cult of

                                >Masmoudi</persName> has made a bid for the post of <gloss

                            essential that the government and the party be so “institutionalized”
                            that a government upheaval is impossible. A strong advocate of
                            ministerial responsibility, he has twice resigned government posts—in
                            1960 because members of the presidential entourage meddled in the
                            affairs of his ministry and again in 1968 when he openly opposed the
                            government's economic program. In 1968 he was expelled <pb n="17"
                                xml:id="d156-17" facs="d156-17"/>from the party but was readmitted
                            two years later. He was dismissed as minister of the interior in early
                            September because he objected to <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>'s appointment of new governors and a new chief
                            of national security prior to the party congress. At the party congress,
                            he received the second highest number of votes of any candidate elected
                            to the party's central committee, but <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> suspended him from party activity a few days
                            later for making “seditous” statements to the foreign press. Although
                            widely criticized for his maverick tendencies, <persName

                            time the 38-year-old Tunisian was his country's representative to the

                            appointed to the party's Superior Commission in August, but because he
                            failed to be elected to the party's central committee in October, he

                            cannot be discounted entirely as a presidential contender. In the right
                            political atmosphere, he might be chosen to succeed his father.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> Jr. has served as a
                            member of the Superior Commission and was elected to the party's central
                            committee. The 44-year-old former foreign minister was born and educated
                            in France and has had wide diplomatic experience. As the
                            President-Director General of the National Investment Company, he is
                            acquiring economic and financial experience. <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> Jr. has had several sharp differences with his
                            father. In 1961-62 he strongly protested his father's unpopular divorce
                            and subsequent marriage to his longtime mistress. Recently he
                            unsuccessfully sought to moderate the President's vindictive attitude
                            toward former economic czar Ahmed Ben Salah. Although <persName

                            pre-independence period (1955–1956) when nationalist leader Salah Ben
                            Youssef declared armed insurrection against his former ally, Habib
                            Bourguiba; and later, in 1962, when a group of disgruntled military
                            officers and civilians plotted to assassinate President Bourguiba. In
                            both cases the government squelched the threats with a minimum of
                            disruption.</p>
                        <p>Today a serious threat from within is probably remote, despite the
                            activities of a few plotters in exile. Ibrahim Tobal, former secretary
                            to Salah Ben Youssef, is the most notable of these, Tobal has found
                            asylum in Algiers, where he has collected an Algerian government subsidy
                            in exchange for performing varied tasks for Sonatrach, the Algerian
                            national oil and gas company. He may be considered the leader of what
                            remains of the Youssefist opposition, although his several years outside
                            the country <pb n="2" xml:id="d157-02" facs="d157-02"/>have probably
                            weakened his links with the interior.</p>
                        <p>Another dissident group consists of Baathists. Amor Sehimi, former
                            Paris-based chief of the Tunisian Baathists, was assassinated in Beirut
                            on October 7, 1971, apparently on his way to Baghdad. A disagreement
                            with his Iraqi sponsors, reportedly over finances, had led to an open
                            break. Sehimi is also known to have had some contacts with South Yemeni
                            officials and Libyans. Sehimi’s major contact within Tunisia was said to
                            be Mohamed Messaoud Chabi, a former leftist student who visited the US
                            in 1964. The leadership of the external Baathist organization apparently
                            has fallen on Abdessatar Aleya el Keffi, a former Tunisian student in
                            Iraq and Iran now residing in Paris. What little is known of the
                            internal Youssefist and Baathist organizations indicates they possess
                            limited, if any, means for effective subversion.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian military establishment has been almost completely apolitical
                            in the past. While there may be a trend away from this, we have seen no
                            indications of subversive plotting. We know very little about the
                            current political attitudes of Tunisian military officers, particularly
                            the younger ones. Given the present transition to a post-Bourguiba era
                            and the propensity of African and Arab armies to assume leadership in
                            times of stress, however, future involvement by the Tunisian military
                            should not be completely discounted.</p>
                        <p>Tunisian students have been relatively troublesome, but they remain
                            divided over a wide spectrum of ideologies, ranging from Arab
                            nationalism <pb n="3" xml:id="d157-03" facs="d157-03"/>to Maoism, and
                            have been largely neutralized by a subtle combination of government
                            repression and response. Tunisian students in France, while susceptible
                            to the radical ideologies of the French left, have not demonstrated the
                            means to become a threat to the regime.</p>
                        <p>The strong showing of the liberal faction of the ruling Destourian
                            Socialist Party during the recent Eighth Party Congress brought into the
                            open a challenge to the conservative and personalized rule of President
                            Bourguiba. This challenge, coming at a crucial phase of transition to
                            the post-Bourguiba era, may well herald the end of consensus politics,
                            which since independence has shown great resiliency in accommodating
                            dissent within the Party. The present calm following the Congress shows,
                            however, that the system still has flexibility.</p>

                            <hi rend="underline">Algerian-Tunisian Relations Warming</hi>, Mutual
                            distrust between Algeria and Tunisia, exacerbated by a border dispute in
                            the oil-rich El Borma area, has progressively evaporated since early
                            1969. The two governments signed a treaty of friendship in January 1970,
                            and agreed to a border settlement that put bilateral relations on a new
                            and positive footing. The removal of major points of contention and
                            Algeria’s preoccupation with internal economic development have tended
                            to aid this trend. President Bourguiba, who has an outstanding
                            invitation to visit Algeria, recently praised closening
                            Algerian-Tunisian relations. The Tunisian Foreign Minister is about to
                            visit Algiers.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d157-04" facs="d157-04"/>
                        <p>While Tunisian dissident Tobal still resides in Algiers, the Algerian
                            government has recently accused him of working for Egypt and deprived
                            him of his subsidy. The Tunisians hardly have grounds for protest about
                            Tobal, since they have allowed Tahar Zibiri, the archenemy of Algerian
                            President Houari Boumediene, to live in Tunis since shortly after
                            Zibiri’s abortive coup attempt in December 1967.</p>

                            Relations</hi>. Relations between Libya and Tunisia have qradually
                            improved, albeit unevenly, since the low point following the successful
                            coup of September 1969 in Libya. A lingering undercurrent of mutual
                            suspicion remains, nevertheless, although Prime Minister Muammar Qadhafi
                            made a good impression on his Tunisian hosts when he visited in February
                            1971. Economic relations also have improved considerably, and the two
                            countries have given each other some diplomatic support. On the other
                            hand, Libya’s quick offer of help to the Moroccan officers who tried to
                            revolt in July 1971 indicated to the Tunisians that they too might
                            become the target of a Libyan interventionist policy. Active Libyan
                            support for insurgents in Eritrea and in Chad, and for the Palestine <hi
                                rend="underline">fedaveen</hi> and the Libyan moves in support of
                            Sudanese President Jaafar Nimairi during his counter-coup in July, have
                            lent some credence to this fear.</p>
                        <p>Libya gave Tunisian exile Tobal some financial aid before he supposedly
                            fell from favor with Qadhafi, and some unidentified Tunisian dissidents
                            are said to be living in Tripoli. In addition, the Libyans <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d157-05" facs="d157-05"/>probably fear the possible use of
                            Tunisian territory by certain Libyan exiles actively plotting against
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Despite mutual suspicion and a certain potential for future trouble over
                            problems like an undefined sea frontier in the area of a recent oil
                            discovery, both Tunisian and Libyan leadership seem to desire to keep
                            relations on an even keel.</p>

                            would be very important to President Bouguiba. El Gouli said that it was
                            clear in his brief conversation with president Nixon, that the President
                            understands President Bourguiba's concern for security in the
                            Mediterranean and in North Africa, especially the problem of Soviet
                            infiltration. (<persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> remarked
                            parenthetically that President Nixon has been kept fully advised by the
                            White House staff of Bourguiba's concerns.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> said that his welcome
                            at the White House demonstrates that there is good will toward Tunisia
                            here in Washington. In this connection the Ambassador expressed hope
                            that the US would be able to provide help in response to Tunisia's
                            request for internal security assistance. Mr.
                                <persName>Newsom</persName> stressed that there is indded good will
                            in the USG toward its <pb n="1" xml:id="d158-02" facs="d158-02"
                            />friends. He noted, however, that there is a growing problem in how the
                            US can manifest this goodwill when its means to help are more limited.
                            For example, the Congress has removed from the assistance bill all
                            proposed authorizations for public safety. In these circumstances,
                            requests for internal security assistance raise some very difficult
                            problems. As for Tunisia's request, we expect to know in the next few
                            days how we might best resolve our mutual problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="underline">Military Assistance.</hi> The Ambassador raised the
                            question of military assistance, expressing hope that beyond what was
                            provided by the US last year, Tunisia would receive more in the furture.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> said that it was
                            generally understood when the US assistance package was delivered in the
                            Spring of 1971 that Tunisia would continue to receive help. Mr.
                                <persName>Newsom</persName> said that the US would certainly do what
                            it could to help. He noted, however, that at the present time there is a
                            differences of about $50 million in the amounts of overall, world-wide
                            military assistance that the Senate and the House are prepared to
                            provide. Given existing US commitments in Indo-China, should the lesser
                            amount be approved, there would be difficult problems. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> said that he fully understood
                            this problem but expressed hope that since Tunisia's needs are som small
                            -- perhaps only a few million dollars -- the US would be able to find a
                            way few million dollars -- the US would be able to find a way to help.
                            He suggested that since there are already several assistance programs in
                            Tunisia, perhaps some mutually advantageous arrangement could be worked
                            out. Mr. <persName>Newsom</persName> agreed that we should try to match
                            our mutual possibilities. He added that the Ambassador should be assured
                            that Tunisia will remain one of the five countries in Africa which will
                            continue to receive military assistance - the precise amount to be
                            workded out here in Washington, considering overall availabilities,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Newsom</persName> concluded by informing <persName
                                corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> that the serious problems
                            affecting the overall US assistance effort would require the US to
                            inform its friends that it could no longer do as much as it has done in
                            the past. This could, if misunderstood, perhaps lead our friends to
                            question whether there might be changes in our basic attitude toward
                            them. Mr. <persName>Newsom</persName> stressed that our friends should
                            understand that the issue is not one of basic relationships but of
                            resources.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that he wished to
                            convey certain decisions that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            has reached concerning several recent requests by Tunisia for
                            assistance, particularly the request for internal security assistance.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that only
                            after a very thorough and time-consuming examination of all the possible
                            alternatives involved, was it possible to arrive at these decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> frankly informed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> that the
                            means of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to provide assistance
                            in the internal security field have become very limited. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that in the months that
                            have passed since officers of our Embassy in Tunis met with Tunisian
                            officials to reduce the internal security request to its most essential
                            elements; an important element of Congress has been revealed that it is
                            against public safety assistance. He referred to the Senate's recent
                            amendment to the appropriation bill proposing that public safety
                            programs be limited to financing from security assistance funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that while every
                            effort was made to respond in a positive way to the Tunisian request,
                            given the mood of Congress, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has
                            concluded that it cannot provide assistance to Tunisia in the area of
                            internal security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            assured Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> that
                            the U.S. remains very interested in <pb n="2" xml:id="d159-02"
                                facs="d159-02"/>Tunisia and will continue to make a substantial
                            effort to assist in Tunisia's development. In this connection, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> informed <persName
                                corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> that the US is prepared to
                            demonstrate its special friendship for Tunisia by considering the
                            addition of $1 million to the Agricultural Sector Loan now being
                            developed in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> referred to the recent
                            US decision to open negotiations in Tunis on the addition of 60,000 tons
                            of wheat and 10,000 tons of soybean oil to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                            Agreement. The value of these additions is about $4 million. He pointed
                            out that the U.S. remains Tunisia's major assistance donor with proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 loans and grants totaling
                            nearly $40 million, or about 11 percent of the total US economic
                            assistance to Africa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> expressed hope that the
                            very substantial development assistance which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is providing under very tight budgetary
                            circumstances will help Tunisia meet its varied requirements and perhaps
                            free Tunisian foreign exchange for any purchases of internal security
                            equipment Tunisia might wish to make. He added, that should Tunisia wish
                            to consider buying internal security equipment, the US would be prepared
                            to offer TDY services, on a grant basis, of a public safety expert to
                            advise on purchases.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for the US decision to open negotiations on adding wheat
                            and oil to the current <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Agreement
                            and for the offer to add $1 million to the AG Sector Loan. He said,
                            however, that his government will be disappointed that the US will not
                            be able to assist in meeting Tunisia's internal security needs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> asked whether the
                            question of internal security assistance might be reviewed in the
                            future. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that this
                            should be considered the final decision on the Tunisian request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that the long
                            study which preceded our decision carefully assessed all of the problems
                            involved. He noted that there are never problems with the Congress
                            concerning the economic program in Tunisia. However, when one discusses
                            internal security assistance problems do arise.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> asked whether
                            the program loan might be used to procure some of the non-military type
                            items included in the internal security request, for example,
                            communications equipment. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: The Ambassador
                            was probably referring to electrical generators. There was no mention of
                            communications equipment in the request as delivered.) Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d159-03" facs="d159-03"/>public safety purchases under the
                            program loan would not be appropriate, noting that the expenditures to
                            be made under that loan were generally determined last year when it was
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that it is now
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> policy to concentrate assistance
                            in specific economic sectors. For this reason, the usual program loan in
                            Tunisia is being replaced this year by an agricultural sector loan. In
                            offering to seek the addition of $1 million to that loan we are hopeful
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be able to free
                            foreign exchange for any internal security purchases that it might wish
                            to make.</p>
                        <p>Military Assistance. The Ambassador asked whether there was any word yet
                            about the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 military assistance
                            program for Tunisia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that legislation has not yet cleared Congress and until it does
                            we will not be in a position to discuss the Tunisian program. He
                            expressed regret that the complicated internal processes of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may seem sometimes to make life
                            difficult for our friends.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            emphasized that the US response to Tunisia's request for help represents
                            a very considerable effort, under difficult circumstances, to assist a
                            friend. He noted, for example, that there are certain risks in seeking
                            to enlarge the AG sector loan, when the objective is to free Tunisian
                            foreign exchange for public safety purchases. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName> expressed his understanding
                            of the problems posed by the Tunisian request and said that he would
                            seek to place the US response in proper perspective for his
                            government.</p>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/>WASHINGTON<lb/>March 14, 1972</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>With deepest appreciation, I wish to thank you for the warm sentiments
                            conveyed to me in your recent letter which was delivered personally by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EGS1">El Goulli</persName>. I think
                            often of the close and friendly ties that have long existed between our
                            two nations and of the very special affection which the United States
                            and the American people have for you.</p>
                        <p>It was in the spirit of our rapport that I asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to share with you some of my
                            early thoughts concerning my visits to Peking and Moscow. I feel very
                            strongly that close consultations with our good friends, such as
                            Tunisia, are essential in pursuing our mutual objectives of world peace
                            and security. As a further step in these consultations, I have asked
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to convey to
                            you some of my observations following my return from the People's
                            Republic of China.</p>
                        <p>It is always appropriate and useful that Tunisia and the United States
                            maintain close contact, not only because our nations share common
                            international goals, but because the United States remains deeply
                            interested in Tunisia, both in its security and in its development.</p>
                        <p>You may be assured, Mr. President, that with the resources that are
                            available, the United States will continue to do what it can to assist
                            in Tunisia's further development.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d160-02" facs="d160-02"/>
                        <p>I also wish to express to you my personal admiration for the unflagging
                            efforts you have made to promote world peace and to further human
                            understanding. I look forward to close and continuing cooperation
                            between our two nations.</p>

                                DESPITE ITS LACK OF NATURAL RESOURCES, SOME ILL-ADVISED SOCIAL AND

                            <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> said he would be leaving
                            for Tunis at 10:00 p.m. and was very sorry to have missed having a
                            further opportunity to meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Speaking personally and emotionally - and at length - the <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> said he did not understand American
                            policy. It almost looked as if the US and the Soviets had agreed on a
                            division of spheres of influence that would turn over the entire Arab
                            east to the Russians and bring the latter to Tunisia's border. Why had
                            the US completely written off the Palestinians and become totally wedded
                            to the Israelis? This made it very difficult for America's friends like
                            Tunisia. Sadat had thrown the Russians out but in the absence of any
                            support from the US, he would have no choice but to enter into a new
                            relationship with them. The Libyans were, like himself, very devout
                            (tres croyants) but they too would he driven by despair to deal with the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> protested, as
                            possible, that there clearly was no agreement with the Soviets on
                            spheres of influence, in the Mediterranean or elsewhere in the ME.
                            Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had made a
                            special point of emphasizing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of
                            the Palestinian people and had, as the <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            well knew, made great efforts to find a peaceful settlement in the
                            ME.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> stated that he disagreed
                            profoundly with the US position on terrorism. How was it possible for an
                            Arab not to feel deeply about the fate of the Palestinians? Why did the
                            US react so strongly to acts of despair by the Palestinians while
                            passing over in silence the daily terrorism of the Israelis, who had
                            founded their state with its use?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> tried unsuccessfully
                            to persuade <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> to draw a distinction
                            between acts of war and indiscriminate threats to innocent
                            non-combatants, or to reassure him that our proposed Convention clearly
                            excluded political movements.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> nevertheless was obviously very
                            pained at this seemingly insuperable difference that had arisen in the
                            hitherto extremely close US/Tunisian relationship. He said that Tunisia
                            was obliged for the sake of credibility to make approaches to Hanoi, but
                            that should not interfere with the US connection. (He said nothing about
                            going to Saigon.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> in closing urged that
                            the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> continue the dialogue with
                            Ambassador Seelye, who would shortly be arriving in Tunis.</p>

                        <p>When our new ambassador to Tunisia presented his credentials to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> he also transmitted
                            an oral message of greetings from you and a warmly inscribed photograph.
                            He reported that <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> was
                            deeply touched by your personal gestures and expressed warmest thanks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> has now sent you a
                            photograph of himself and a long and thoughtful letter of thanks (Tab
                            B).</p>
                        <p>While this is ostensibly a thank-you letter, <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> injects a substantive point which would appear

                            re-examine together our bilateral relations…and analyze together in
                            order to jointly undertake the actions necessary for the consolidation
                            of peace and security in this world.”</p>
                        <p>We do not know precisely what <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> has in mind. The consensus is that he may
                            simply be seeking general reassurance that the US remains interested in
                            Tunisia. Should it be more than that, someone can always be sent to talk
                            with him. Also, both you and the Vice President have standing
                            invitations to visit Tunisia, and our Assistant Secretary for African
                            Affairs is often in the area. This last could meet the need for the time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, all that seems required is to reply to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> with a warm letter of
                            reassurance with general agreement on the desirability of a continued
                            exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you sign the letter to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> at Tab A. [Text cleared with
                            Mr. <persName>Price</persName>'s office.]</p>
