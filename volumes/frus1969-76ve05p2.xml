                <p>The Department of State released today <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume E–5, Part 2, Documents on North Africa,
                    1969-1972. This electronic-only volume is available on the Department of State's
                    website. Part of the ongoing official documentary history of U.S. foreign
                    policy, this is the promised second portion of an electronic-only volume that in
                    two parts covers Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, 1969-1972. The first part
                    on Sub-Saharan African has been on the Department's website since October 2005.
                    The portion released today presents the record of U.S. policies towards North
                    Africa. Documentation on U.S. policy towards Southern Africa, 1969-1976, is
                    scheduled for later publication in <ref target="frus1969-76v28">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, volume
                    XXVIII</ref>.</p>
                <p>The volume has a chapter on general U.S. policy towards the region, which
                    demonstrates that U.S. analysts concluded that North Africa would remain
                    politically stable, with the possible exception of Libya, where a successful
                    coup by young military officers overthrew the monarchy. Still, the analysts
                    assured the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration that by
                    actively engaging the countries of North Africa and by encouraging the United
                    States European allies to do the same, the area could be kept free of Soviet
                    domination.</p>
                <p>The documents on Algeria reflect the role of U.S. influence, rather than active
                    diplomacy, since the radical government of Algeria had earlier broken relations
                    with the United States over its Middle East and Vietnam polices. While U.S.
                    political relations with Algeria were limited, commercial relations saw steady
                    improvement. Algeria's willingness to give safe haven to terrorist and dissident
                    groups, like the Black Panthers, did nothing to improve U.S.-Algerian diplomatic
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Libya was the country with the most potential for problems, but the new military
                    government moved slowly. Eventually it negotiated with Washington the
                    termination of the Wheelus Air Force Base agreement. The primary issue for
                    Tripoli was the delivery of U.S. jet aircraft, which the United States had
                    contracted to sell to the previous Libyan Government. The chapter covers
                    deliberations in Washington over this issue: would the sale of aircraft
                    antagonize Israel and result in more arms requests from them? Could the sale
                    prevent potential Libyan nationalization of American and European oil companies?
                    In the end, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                    concluded that the sale would neither appreciably worsen, nor improve, relations
                    with Tripoli, and denied delivery. The Libyan reaction was sharp, with threats
                    to go to the Soviet Union for weapons; however, U.S.-Libyan relations continued
                    on a reduced, but still workable level.</p>
                <p>Morocco under King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> was a strong
                    ally of the United States and a moderate voice in the Arab-Israeli dispute;
                    however, the documents in this chapter demonstrate that nonetheless there were
                    still tensions. Unsuccessful coups and calls in Morocco for political reform of
                    the royal government caused both <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration to look
                    again at their relationship. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    agreed to broaden his government, but warned that this could have repercussions
                    for the United States. In order to continue friendly relations with Morocco and
                    to support <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, the United States
                    agreed to be more responsive to his needs and to reduce the U.S. military
                    presence in Morocco. Far from U.S. disengagement, this measure was designed to
                    preserve relations.</p>
                <p>Tunisia under President Bourguiba was perhaps America's closest ally in North
                    Africa, but Bourguiba was ill and nearing retirement. The sale of Soviet arms to
                    Algeria and the Libyan coup increased Tunisia's sense of insecurity, but the
                    United States was only prepared to provide a modest increase in military
                    assistance and rhetorical support in the form of assurances from President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Even Tunisia clashed verbally
                    with U.S. officials over U.S. support for Israel; however, the overall
                    relationship between the two countries remained strong.</p>
                <p>This volume relies on documentation generated by the Assistant to the President
                    for National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff, and the
                    records of the Department of State. It also includes documentation from the

                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>Early in President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName>'s first
                    term, officials monitoring U.S.-North African relations had grounds for some
                    satisfaction. U.S. ties with Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya were firm. Although
                    Algeria had not yet resumed diplomatic relations broken during the 1967
                    Arab-Israeli war, its economic links with the United States were expanding. Yet
                    for all North African governments, friendly or otherwise, the Arab-Israeli issue
                    complicated relations with Washington. The conflict was a major factor in
                    continuing Algerian resistance to reestablishing formal ties with Washington. In
                    Libya, a military junta, pledging internal reform and espousing Arab nationalism
                    and the Palestinian cause, overthrew the unpopular pro-western monarchy in
                    September 1969. Thereafter, the administration's concern over Israeli
                    sensibilities influenced its decision not to fulfill its aircraft contract with
                    the Libyan government, to the detriment of U.S.-Libyan relations. In Morocco,
                    Washington was allied with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>,
                    partly for his “moderate” stand on issues like the Arab-Israeli question. Yet as
                        <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> moved Morocco towards more
                    representative government, he warned that Morocco's firm support for the United
                    States could change. Even Tunisia, a staunch U.S. ally, pushed Washington for a
                    more energetic pursuit of Middle East peace, but was disappointed.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">North Africa: General</p>
                <p>The challenge for the North African states was to forge beneficial relations with
                    the United States, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and France, while
                    still maintaining their independence. Washington's support of Israel, however,
                    strained North African-U.S. relations. Regional governments pressed the United
                    States to resolve the Middle East crisis and attempted to defuse the issue
                    themselves. In 1969, Morocco hosted two conferences, one Islamic and one Arab,
                    in an attempt to seize the initiative on the Middle East from Arab “radicals”
                    and bolster its fellow “moderates.” Arab nationalists took heart from the Libyan
                    coup in September 1969, and it prompted U.S. officials to reexamine trends and
                    options in North Africa in January 1970.</p>
                <p>U.S. analysts concluded that Algeria and Morocco were likely to remain
                    politically stable in the near future, in the latter case due to King <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s tight grip on power. However, in
                    Tunisia, where the ailing President Bourguiba was likely to step down, and
                    Libya, where an inexperienced military junta ruled, the reports predicted
                    political turmoil. Still, without a major Arab-Israel war or western
                    disengagement, analysts saw no significant likelihood of Soviet dominance of the
                    area. The National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>)
                    Interdepartmental Group agreed in 1970 that, to maintain its regional interests,
                    the United States should continue an active relationship with all North African
                    governments, but also welcome a Western European presence. Since U.S. influence
                    was limited by Washington's close identification with Israel, Western Europe,
                    particularly France, could provide the counterpoise to the Soviets in North
                    Africa.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Algeria</p>
                <p>Although U.S.-Algerian commercial ties were steadily improving by 1969, tensions
                    between the two countries remained. Some U.S. analysts speculated that while
                    Algeria maintained ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, France,
                    and U.S. companies, ultimately it might lean toward Moscow. Others trusted
                    Algeria's ability to play the big powers off against each other while retaining
                    its independence. To Algiers, Washington's war in Vietnam and pro-Israeli stance
                    posed barriers to the re-establishment of official relations. Yet Algiers also
                    placed high priority on internal economic development and in 1970 sought help
                    from the U.S. government in financing a joint U.S.-Algerian liquefied natural
                    gas project.</p>
                <p>In the belief that improved commercial relations could lead to renewed diplomatic
                    ties, the administration allowed the importation of Algerian natural gas in
                    1971, despite French opposition. In 1972, Washington approved a U.S. firm's sale
                    of an air defense network to Algiers. With U.S. encouragement, Algeria upgraded
                    the status of its representative at the Algerian Interests Section in Washington
                    in 1970, and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> periodically
                    corresponded with President Houari Boumedienne. Yet Algeria resisted U.S.
                    pressure to resume diplomatic relations, arguing that Washington had made too
                    little progress in resolving the Arab-Israeli crisis. Washington, meanwhile,
                    grew exasperated at Algiers for giving safe haven to groups the United States
                    regarded as terrorist and dissident, such as the Black Panthers, who staged
                    dramatic hijackings of U.S. aircraft in 1972. This issue joined Vietnam and the
                    Middle East as matters hindering the reestablishment of U.S.-Algerian relations
                    in this period.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Libya:</p>
                <p>U.S. officials recognized that the authoritarian and corrupt monarchy of King
                    Idris had an uncertain future, and attempted to distance themselves from a U.S.
                    commitment to the succession of Idris' son. On September 1, 1969, a group of
                    little known young military officers staged a coup and set up a new government,
                    the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>), which
                    the United States warily recognized. Although its initial statements were
                    measured, the new government was, according to <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> analysts, unlikely to remain so, and would probably insist on
                    U.S. withdrawal from Wheelus Airforce Base. In October 1969, Tripoli requested
                    discussions to terminate the U.S. presence. To protect U.S. interests,
                    particularly oil, Washington agreed to withdraw in mid-1970 from Wheelus.</p>
                <p>When Morocco and Tunisia expressed concern at U.S. failure to restore the Libyan
                    monarchy, Washington disavowed the right to save governments from internal
                    threats. More to the point, as internal studies indicated, Washington had
                    limited leverage and at best could work with, and try to influence, the new
                    regime. Contrary to Libyan suspicions, the United States denied involvement in
                    the attempted countercoup against the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> in
                    December 1969, and even helped thwart several later coup attempts by Libyan
                    exiles. A functioning U.S.-Libyan relationship seemed possible.</p>
                <p>To Tripoli, however, the great test of U.S.-Libyan relations was the eight F-5
                    aircraft which the United States had contracted to sell to the previous regime.
                    When the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> demanded delivery, the United
                    States deferred a decision, pending a clearer picture of Libyan developments.
                    The arming of Libya, some U.S. officials argued, would antagonize Israel, which
                    might itself demand more aircraft and further destabilize the region. To some in
                    the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> the United States was too pro-Israeli to
                    be a partner. <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> Chairman <persName
                        corresp="#p_QM1">Mu'ammer Qadhafi</persName>, noting Tripoli's profound
                    concern with the plight of the Palestinians, warned that the United States would
                    lose the Arabs because of its commitment to Israel. In mid-1970, irritated at
                    the delays from western military suppliers, Libya accepted its first arms
                    delivery from the Soviet Union, while avowing its intention of maintaining its
                    independence and non-alignment.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as negotiations between the Libyans and the oil industry intensified,
                    the United States concluded correctly that although Libya would bargain hard for
                    better terms, perhaps including 51% control of oil companies, outright
                    nationalization of the oil industry was unlikely. Secretary of Defense <persName
                        corresp="#p_LMR1">Melvin Laird</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                        corresp="#p_PJAII1">Joseph Palmer</persName> believed that Washington should
                    make some effort to accommodate the Libyans on the question of the F-5 sales,
                    which Deputy Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">John
                        Irwin</persName> argued could protect U.S. oil investments. The President's
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName> vacillated on the question, initially accepting that no
                    gesture would make the Libyan government less hostile and later agreeing to
                    consider releasing the F-5s in order to protect the oil companies. But in the
                    end <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> sided with Secretary of
                    State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName>, who asserted that
                    the refusal to sell had not appreciably damaged relations and that the sale
                    would provide no security to the oil companies. The United States continued to
                    refuse to provide new weapons to Libya, without saying so explicitly.</p>
                <p>Libya did not nationalize any U.S. companies but in May 1972, it requested a
                    reduction in the size of the U.S. embasy from thirty-five to fourteen. In
                    October, the Libyan Foreign Minister called the failure of the United States to
                    fulfill the F-5 contract the major problem in U.S.-Libyan bilateral relations.
                    Moreover, Qadhafi sent word through the Ambassador that, due to Washington's
                    refusal to deliver arms to Libya while opening its arsenal to Israel, Tripoli
                    could now be forced to turn to Moscow with more regularity. By December, the
                    Embassy warned that, due to its support for Israel, the United States could
                    expect a new policy of overt discrimination against its interests, and
                    recommended that Washington remove “unnecessary misunderstandings in the area of
                    arms supply.” No change was forthcoming, however, in Washington's policy of
                    deferring the F-5 question.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Morocco:</p>
                <p>Although U.S.-Moroccan relations in 1969 were generally sound, the Arab-Israeli
                    crisis put pressure on King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> to
                    lean more towards neutralism and to be more receptive to Soviet overtures.
                    Following the Libyan coup, however, the regime became uneasy at the prospects
                    for regional subversion by hard-line pro-Palestinian elements, and urged the
                    United States to expand its influence in the Maghreb. In his conferences that
                    year, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> tried to preempt
                    “radical” elements under the leadership of Iraq and Egypt and to forge a
                    “moderate” consensus on the Arab-Israeli issue. When Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> visited Morocco in
                    February 1970, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> pressed the
                    Washington to impose peace on the Middle East to avoid further upheaval and
                    Soviet infiltration. In June, the King sent a special envoy to Washington at
                    Egyptian President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Gamal Abdel Nasser</persName>'s
                    request to emphasize the seriousness of Egypt's peace appeal. The United States,
                    the envoy urged, should cease arms deliveries to Israel and force it to accept
                    the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council settlement. Yet while the
                    President was eager to support the “moderates” and show willingness for peace,
                    he viewed Soviet influence on Egypt, not Israel, as the great obstacle to
                    settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
                <p>In response to critics, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                    proposed in July 1970 to end a five-year “state of exception” by drafting a
                    constitution and restoring parliament. These reforms were mostly cosmetic,
                    however, and <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> retained his royal
                    power. He also hoped to use the controversial U.S. military facilities at
                    Kenitra, nominally under Moroccan control, as a lever for greater U.S.
                    assistance. When a Senate subcommittee referred to the facilities as a “U.S.
                    base,” Rabat seized on the language to demand a higher “counterpart.” Privately,
                    the administration concluded that the United States should attempt to retain
                    access to the Kenitra facilities as long as the political and economic costs
                    were not insurmountable for either Rabat or Washington. Yet while prepared to
                    increase aid, Washington was determined to avoid a quid pro quo for Kenitra.</p>
                <p>In July 1971, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> survived a coup
                    attempt by disaffected military officers. U.S. analysts observed that <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s lifestyle and concentration of power
                    placed the King in danger of popular revolt. In the aftermath of the uprising,
                    the King determined to coordinate more fully with Washington, even as the
                    administration hoped to avoid too close an identification with his government.
                    In August 1972, another group of military officers made an unsuccessful attempt
                    on the King's life. By underscoring <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                        >Hassan</persName>'s shaky prospects, the attack prompted U.S. officials to
                    reconsider policy toward Morocco, including perhaps reducing the U.S. military
                    presence. Given the King's reluctance to reform, analysts speculated, another
                    plot against him was likely to succeed. For his part, <persName
                        corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> incorrectly suspected that the United
                    States had been involved in the plot. As he pledged to broaden his government,
                        <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> warned that the opposition
                    would demand that Morocco assume more control of U.S. bases, consolidate them,
                    and extract higher rent. The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>'s Senior Review
                    Group concluded that since friendly relations with Morocco were important and
                    the King was still the focal point of authority, the United States should be
                    responsive to his needs and reduce its military presence. Far from disengaging
                    from the King, this maneuver was designed to preserve U.S. relations with his
                    government.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tunisia:</p>
                <p>One of the poorest North African countries, Tunisia was also probably
                    Washington's closest ally in the region. U.S. officials believed that long-time
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> would shortly
                    retire, and that his unnamed successor was unlikely to be so pro-western. Yet
                    while recognizing that <persName>Bourguiba</persName> was personally responsible
                    for the warmth of U.S.-Tunisian relations, the administration judged that
                    Tunisia would continue to maintain strong links with Washington. In late 1970,
                    when <persName>Bourguiba</persName> was diagnosed with arterial brain damage,
                    the administration arranged for the President's medical treatment in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>The United States saw no need to offer much incentive for Tunisia's loyalty
                    beyond rhetorical support. In 1969, Tunis pressed Washington unsuccessfully for
                    a more comprehensive military aid package to offset the threat from Moscow and
                    Soviet-armed Algiers, and to show the benefits of the U.S. alliance. The Libyan
                    coup only increased Tunisia's sense of insecurity. U.S. officials believed
                    Tunis's fears were exaggerated, although President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> voiced personal sympathy for their concerns. When other
                    exigencies forced the United States to make reductions in assistance to Tunisia
                    in 1970, officials were careful to declare U.S. interest in Tunisian security,
                    which “represented the extent to which we have been willing to go in response to
                    Tunisia's request for a special security relationship with the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>Together with military assistance, another persistent issue in U.S.-Tunisian
                    relations was the conflict in the Middle East. During the Secretary of State's
                    February 1970 trip to North Africa, Rogers found the Tunisians preoccupied by
                    the Palestinian crisis. Under new Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                        >MOHAMED MASMOUDI</persName>, U.S. analysts reported, Tunisia was bringing
                    its policy more into line with that of the “radical” Arabs. In meetings with
                    U.S. officials that autumn, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>
                    emphasized the importance of U.S. pressure on Israel to achieve a Middle East
                    settlement, and of greater military aid to Tunisia. Both of these steps, the
                    Foreign Minister emphasized, would help to keep the Soviets at bay. On the
                    Arab-Israeli issue, there was little progress. In late 1972, <persName
                        corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> confronted the U.S. Ambassador to the
                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, accusing the United States of writing off
                    the Palestinians and becoming wedded to the Israelis, leaving Washington's Arab
                    friends in an untenable position.</p>
                <p>On the military front, Washington attempted to be somewhat more responsive. In
                    1971, Washington added a modest $1 million to the $3 million military assistance
                    program for Tunisia, with a renewed assurance of the President's concern.
                    However, the administration declined Tunis's 1972 request for additional
                    internal security aid, softening the rejection with more development assistance.
                    Concerned that Tunisia was undervalued by the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJA1"
                        >John Calhoun</persName> urged the administration to preserve the present
                    relationship by maintaining U.S. programs and agreeing to
                        <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s request for a high-level review of
                    U.S.-Tunisian relations. In December 1972, however, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> responded to the request with his standard device by again
                    reassuring Bourguiba of the United States' interest in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>The combined effect of the documentation presented in this volume indicates that
                    while North Africa was important enough for the United States to wish to retain
                    the region in the western camp and prevent inroads into the area by the Soviet
                    Union or Arab radicals, North Africa was not a priority for U.S. foreign policy
                    under President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>. Therefore, North
                    African demands for changes in U.S. policy towards Israel and the Israeli-Arab
                    crisis, or increased military aid or sales generally, received political but
                    basically non-committal responses from Washington.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President <persName
                        corresp="#p_BGHW1">George H. W. Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991,
                    established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the Foreign Relations series is guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions made
                    without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing a defect
                    in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions
                    and actions of the foreign policy of the administration of <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>. This is the third <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be published in a new format,
                    that of electronic-only publication. Approximately 25 percent of the volumes
                    scheduled for publication for the 1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName

                        >Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>
                    administrations, will be in this format. The decision to institute this change
                    was taken in full consultation with the Department's Advisory Committee on
                    Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established under the Foreign
                    Relations statute. The advantages of this new method of presenting documentation
                    are evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access to more key
                    documentation on a broader range of issues, all or any portion of which can be
                    easily downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is
                    still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volume. This electronic-only publication results in
                    substantial savings in cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to
                    present a fuller range of documentation, on a wider range of topics, sooner than
                    would have been possible under a print-only format. These advantages compensate
                    for the fact that this <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an
                    actual book bound in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the
                    Historian, the General Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all
                    dedicated to publishing the great majority of the volumes in the <hi

                    posted in electronic format on the Department of State's website. While the
                    future of research in documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease
                    of use and availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue
                    to use both print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In
                    that sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the
                    series begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by
                    subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140 years.</p>

                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration toward North and sub-Saharan Africa and
                    with the exceptions of the Republic of South Africa, Angola, Mozambique,
                    Rhodesia, and Namibia, which are covered in print volume <ref

                    Southern Africa, 1969-1976. This volume does not attempt to cover all countries
                    in sub-Saharan or North Africa, but instead concentrates on those areas where
                    U.S. interests and concerns were greatest. The chapters on general U.S. policy
                    toward Africa and North Africa provide the widest scope of coverage.</p>
                <p>The largest chapter, comprising more than half the sub-Saharan section of the
                    volume, documents the Nigeria civil war and its aftermath. While the United
                    States did not recognize the rebellion in Biafra and followed a policy of
                    non-intervention, it was heavily involved in providing humanitarian relief
                    mainly through the International Committee of the Red Cross and Joint Church
                    Aid. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> appointed a Special
                    Coordinator on Relief to Civilian Victims of the Nigerian Civil War to provide
                    guidance and direction to relief operations and to deflect some of the domestic
                    criticism of the U.S. policy of non-intervention. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> himself was sympathetic to Biafran aspirations and the
                    suffering caused by the civil war, and complained about, but did not to change,
                    the Department of State policy of refusing to recognize Biafra as a
                    belligerent.</p>
                <p>The second great humanitarian crisis covered by the volume relates to the 1972
                    massacres of Hutus by Tutsis in Burundi. Again the Department of State followed
                    a low-key, non-intervention policy and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration did not make any effort to prevent the
                    brutality and massacres beyond again expressing private dismay.</p>
                <p>Chapters on Congo and the Horn of Africa highlight the growing U.S relationship
                    with President <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Joseph Mobutu</persName> of Zaire
                    and Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> of Ethiopia as
                    the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration attempted to
                    create strong, pro-American governments in those two key African countries,
                    especially through military assistance and sales of military equipment. On the
                    other hand, in the Horn of Africa chapter, the volume documents the
                    deterioration of U.S. relations with the Somali Republic and the virtual
                    breakdown of U.S. relations with Uganda under the erratic leadership of
                    President Idi Amin is documented in the Uganda chapter.</p>
                <p>There are four chapters on U.S. bilateral relations with North Africa—Algeria,
                    Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Algeria and Libya, the United States faced
                    radical governments with strong pro-Palestinian leanings. Algeria did not have
                    diplomatic relations with the United States, but commercial and economic ties
                    remained strong. The overthrow of the Libyan monarchy in September 1969 by young
                    military officers forced the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    Administration to reconsider its relationship with Libya. The documentary
                    records indicates that in the end the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration decided to maintained diplomatic relations
                    with Libya and use its economic connections in the hopes of influencing the new
                    military government towards a more pro-Western stance. The documentation on
                    relations with staunch U.S. allies Morocco and Tunisia are highlighted by
                    high-level visits of leaders, mutual assurances of support, and military aid. In
                    all four chapters, there is documentation indicates that each of these
                    governments, in its own way, attempted to influence the United States to
                    pressure Israel towards a Middle East settlement conducive to Palestinian
                    interests.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines,
                    supplemented by guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the
                    Declassification and Publishing Division. The original text is reproduced
                    exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both visible on the
                    facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note. There is also a
                    text version of the document. The editors have supplied a heading, a summary,
                    and a source note with additional relevant information, as required, for each
                    document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are
                    retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors
                    are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations, persons, and
                    sources accompanies the volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text
                    file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is
                    blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type)
                    appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld
                    because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source
                    note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified.
                    These denied documents are listed in their chronological place in the
                    volume.</p>

                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the

                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The
                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for
                    additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights
                    of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House officials,
                    since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal

                    historical materials in which they were a participant or are mentioned. Further,

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The final declassification
                    review of this volume, which began in 2000 and was completed in 2005, resulted
                    in the decision to withhold 4 (this might change if any N. Afr. denials)
                    documents in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 9 (plus N. Afr. excisions) X
                    documents, and to make minor excisions in 22 (plus N. Afr excisions) documents.
                    The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing
                    this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described
                    above, that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the first
                    Nixon administration toward sub-Saharan and North Africa between 1969 and
                    1972.</p>

                        <p>Diplomatic activity in the Maghreb has quickened since the successful
                            visit in January of Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Houari
                                Boumediene</persName> to Morocco. “Non-alignment” is again the
                            watchword in Morocco and Algeria—although not yet in Tunisia or Libya.
                            While this new climate may place some limits on Soviet influence, it can
                            also have significant drawbacks for the US. But the enhanced stability
                            it provides an area important to US interests may be worth the
                            risks.</p>
                        <p>New Mood in the Maghreb. The Moroccan-Algerian rapprochement has been the
                            major agent of change.(1) Apparently determined to live up to the
                            friendship treaty they signed in January, Morocco and Algeria have now
                            signed a financial accord. Both have been seeking to promote a Maghreb
                            summit to bring Tunisia and Libya into line. The advent of a new
                            administration in Washington, the Nixon-de Gaulle talks, and the
                            suggestion of Spanish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMFM1"
                                >Castiella</persName> that the Mediterranean be cleared of both the
                            US and Soviet fleets have contributed to an atmosphere of international
                            ferment that has affected the mood in the Maghreb.</p>

                            its aid following the Ben Barka affair in late 1965, Morocco has been
                            seeking more diplomatic latitude. The June 1967 war in the Middle
                            East—and <pb n="2" xml:id="d1-02" facs="d1-02"/>protracted US delays in

                            Morocco to seek a more neutralist coloration in its diplomacy. One
                            result has been a gradual warming in Morocco's relations with the <gloss

                            five-year plan. Moroccan Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LA1"
                                >Ahmed Laraki</persName> has also expressed interest in a
                            “Mediterranean pact” that he apparently sees as growing out of the
                            Castiella proposal. At the same time, the Moroccans have been probing
                            for an invitation for King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>

                        <p>Algeria Seeking Alternatives. Algeria is also trying to avoid too great a

                                >USSR</gloss>, Boumediene has moved to demonstrate his independence
                            by bettering relations with his conservative neighbors. To draw a rein
                            on the Soviets, the Algerians have sought more French military
                            assistance and have agreed to a visit by French Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Debre</persName> in May. They, as well as
                            the Moroccans, are now preparing to receive Podgorny and probably hope
                            this will help keep the French on their toes. To keep both countries in
                            line they have hinted at an improvement in relations with the US and
                            have recently received a private delegation of Americans interested in
                            increased trade.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia and Libya More Cautious. Tunisia and Libya have been less quick
                            to respond to these new currents. Tunisia fears, moreover, that Algeria
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d1-03" facs="d1-03"/>and Morocco may be trying to
                            impose a new pattern on the Maghreb. In January the Tunisians obtained
                            some promising results in talks with the Algerians on economic
                            cooperation. Later, however, the Algerians attempted to force through a
                            quick border settlement, with the predictable result that the Tunisians
                            dug in their heels. Both Tunisia and Libya have been seeking nonetheless
                            to broaden their diplomatic options. Tunisia has been moving ahead on
                            its rapprochement with France. (1) Libya, having recently signed a
                            friendship treaty with Algeria, is scheduling visits for the spring by
                            Crown Prince Hassan al-Rida, to its Maghreb neighbors and to France.</p>
                        <p>(1) See Intelligence Note 91, “Franco-Tunisian Rapprochement: Interests

                        <p>Implications for the US. The move towards “non-alignment” resulting from
                            the Moroccan—Algerian rapprochement may have more immediate drawbacks
                            for the US than for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Although
                            Morocco apparently interprets the new relationship as calling for more
                            Soviet and neutralist influence in its foreign policy, Algeria has not
                            shown a corresponding interest in moving closer to the US or other
                            Western countries. Boumediene has recently branded the US Sixth
                            Fleet—but not the Soviet fleet—as “dangerous” to its independence. Even
                            so, Algeria's decision to improve relations with its neighbors probably
                            constitutes a significant contribution to stabilizing an area long torn
                            by rivalries and suspicions and in which the US retains important
                            interests</p>

                        <p>The Rabat meeting of 25 Moslem nations survived postponement attempts and
                            internal conflicts to become the first Islamic Summit Conference. Its
                            concluding declaration and resolutions represented a moderate consensus
                            and may have laid the groundwork for a Moslem bloc.</p>
                        <p>A Major Achievement: Holding the Conference. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> of Morocco, host of the
                            September 22-25 meeting and one of the original promoters of the Summit,
                            called holding of the conference a “miracle of God” and a success in
                            itself. We agree that bringing together government leaders (including 9
                            heads of state) representing about 300 <pb n="2" xml:id="d2-02"
                                facs="d2-02"/>million Moslems was a major achievement. It took
                            considerable skill on the part of Hassan and co-initiator King Faisal of
                            Saudi Arabia to gain rapid agreement for early scheduling of a summit
                            and to persuade suspicious non-Arab Moslems to participate in an
                            Arab-dominated assembly. Less than a week before opening day, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> launched a
                            counteroffensive seeking to postpone the summit indefinitely. In the
                            end, his bluff was called and a UAR delegation was dispatched to Rabat.
                            Only Iraq and Syria of the “progressive” Arab group failed to appear. A
                            final crisis occurred in mid-summit, when a belated invitation to India
                            provoked a stormy Pakistani response and India's ouster. Even this
                            turbulent event, which might have broken up any other conference, only
                            prolonged the meeting an extra day.</p>
                        <p>A Moderate Consensus. Out of the conference came a moderate consensus,
                            despite radical Arab and Palestinian lobbying (the Palestinian
                            Liberation Organization—PLO—was given observer status at the meeting).
                            The official conference declaration, taking the al-Aqsa mosque incident
                            as point of departure, called for restoration of Jerusalem's pre-June
                            1967 status and speedy withdrawal of Israeli military forces from all
                            territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war; it appealed to the US,
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, and France to secure compliance with the 1967
                            Security Council resolution. On Palestine, a solitary sentence affirmed
                            “full support to the Palestinian people for the restitution of their
                            rights” and in their “struggle for national liberation.”</p>
                        <p>The moderate Arab organizers can claim full credit for the language-a
                            compromise that reiterated basic Arab positions without offending
                            non-Arab participants, five of whom have diplomatic relations with
                            Israel. <pb n="3" xml:id="d2-03" facs="d2-03"/>The radical Arabs may
                            regret what might have been added, but can raise no serious objections
                            to the statements in the final declaration.</p>
                        <p>The Makings of a Moslem Bloc? The Moderates undoubtedly hope that they
                            have strengthened the Arab cause in a potentially permanent fashion. The
                            conference declaration spoke of regular consultation and “close
                            cooperation and mutual assistance” among Mos1em states. In addition, the
                            principal resolution set a meeting of Islamic foreign ministers for
                            March 1970 at Jidda to review common action undertaken after the summit
                            and to establish an Islamic permanent secretariat. In sum, the moderates
                            can claim to have created a Moslem bloc to be formally organized next
                            March.</p>
                        <p>Arab moderates will use the success of the Islamic Summit to strengthen
                            their inter-Arab position and to argue against holding an Arab Summit,
                            to which Faisal is adamantly opposed. He fears it would be controlled by
                            radical states, who would call for increased financial contributions
                            from the oil-producers and would push through extreme resolutions. If
                            Faisal also hopes that the projected Moslem bloc will provide an
                            effective counter balance to radical domination of the Arab League, he
                            will probably be disappointed.</p>
                        <p>A consequence of the moderates' success was the absence of attack on the
                            US or “imperialism” in the final statements, However, it is virtually
                            certain that the radical Arab states will continue to agitate for a more
                            extreme political posture in the Islamic forum; unless <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and Faisal can sustain their
                            achievement the resulting dispute could cause a short life—or even
                            stillbirth—for the Moslem bloc.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Fifth Arab Summit Conference at Rabat (December 21-23), which the
                            Arabs convened in high hopes and in an atmosphere relatively free of
                            inter-Arab bilateral disputes, came to an ignominious end in apparently
                            irreconcilable disagreement over the central issue of mobilization for
                            an eventual full-scale war with Israel.</p>
                        <p>Fawzi's Proposals Unacceptable to Some. The summit foundered on the first
                            agenda item—a three-year plan for mi1itary mobilization presented by UAR
                            War Minister Fawzi. In addition to heavy requirements for men and
                            material, the plan reportedly called for huge financial allocations for
                            arms by present financial contributors (Libya, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) and
                            by other states (e.g., Algeria, Morocco) as well. The plan ran aground
                            because of the Iraqi and Syrian demands for an all-out war against
                            Israel now, attempts by the Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians to focus
                            Arab efforts on support for the Palestinians, and Saudi and Kuwaiti
                            unwillingness to increase their financial contributions. When Saudi
                            Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia were clearly unwilling to
                            commit themselves to the financial contributions envisioned by Fawzi's
                            plan, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> staged his walk-out
                            on December 23. The subsequent closed session failed to reach agreement;
                            militant Syria, Iraq, and Southern Yemen boycotted the brief closing
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Arab Disunity: A Mixed Blessing. The disunity at Rabat may push the
                            possibility of another Mideast war further into the future, but it
                            raises questions about the possibilities for peace, since it removes
                            some of the pressure for <pb n="2" xml:id="d3-02" facs="d3-02"
                            />compromise from Israel and may make it even more difficult for
                            individual Arab leaders to agree to a settlement. Furthermore, the
                            conference results may pose problems for the Arab states which opposed
                            the Fawzi plan, in the form of domestic discontent or of campaigns
                            mounted by Arab radicals. Cairo media have already blamed the conference
                            failure on states that “contended they could not offer more to the
                            battle.” It will not take long to discover whether we are on the verge
                            of a renewed “cold war” among the Arabs, or whether the UAR's need for a
                            continuation of the Khartoum subsidy payments will mute any major
                            propaganda-subversion campaigns. The overall impact of the negative
                            psychological reaction in the Arab world has not been felt yet.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may try to regain the
                            initiative at the UAR-Libya-Sudan summit scheduled for December 25 in
                            Tripoli. Though less likely, he has the option of using the Rabat
                            meeting's failure to endorse war preparations as justification for
                            renewed UAR attention to a political settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Fedayeen. Because of the conference's disorderly end, the remaining
                            agenda items—support for the fedayeen and financial aid to Palestinians
                            in the occupied areas—were not resolved. As a result, the Palestinian
                            Liberation Organization apparently did not receive the collective Arab
                            political backing it had sought nor its anticipated subsidy of about $20
                            million per year, but it will probably get increased financial aid from
                            some Arab states, and the overall effect of the summit's collapse on the
                            guerrilla movement will probably be minor. Arafat apparently kept out of
                            the disputes, and Fatah's avowed goal of avoiding subordination to any
                            Arab state may be strengthened by the split at Rabat. The failure of the
                            more grandiose military schemes may also enhance popular support for
                            guerrilla activities.</p>

                                xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>as the Rabat conference opened—probably
                            contributed to the Arab disarray at Rabat by casting doubt on the need
                            for all-out sacrifices in preparation for “inevitable” war. The result
                            was a double benefit for the US: because of our balanced position, the
                            summit was not in the mood to be as critical of the US as expected; and
                            the protracted talk and final breakdown over mobilization of Arab
                            resources meant that the conference ended without an opportunity to turn
                            to consideration of anti-US measures. In the wake of the conference,
                            however, it is possible that extremists may turn to anti-American
                            propaganda themes in their search for a scapegoat.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you know, there has been a series of disturbing developments in North
                            Africa over the past year. Most conspicuous has been the coup in Libya.
                            But we also have President Bourguiba's declining health in Tunisia.
                            Morocco seems calm on the surface, but there has long been
                            dissatisfaction with the government of young King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. Algeria seems to be steering a
                            course of its own with a combination of private American and official
                            French and Soviet aid and it seems to have improved its relations with
                            Morocco and Tunisia recently. But it is the potential power in North
                            Africa, and we have as a government not paid as much attention to it
                            perhaps as we could have.</p>
                        <p>I propose a modest review of our programs in North Africa as they stack
                            up against the trend of events there. This would involve a <gloss

                            in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> process reviewing our options
                            in relation to the trends. I would bring this paper at least as far as
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review Group and leave open the
                            judgment on whether it would need to come to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            attention on the problem more actively could be accomplished by this
                            exercise, leaving the results for your study outside of the <gloss

                        <p>The President has directed a review of the trend of events in North
                            Africa and of U.S. programs, policies and options there.</p>
                        <p>This review should give attention to, though not be limited by, the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>—the prospect for the further spread of radical government; —the prospect
                            and likely character of political and economic cooperation among the
                            North African countries; —the likely Soviet and radical Arab role in
                            those countries; —the role of European countries; —the relationship of
                            the Arab-Israeli impasse to trends in North Africa; —present U.S.
                            programs and policies and resources available for furtherance of U.S.
                            interests; —U.S. options in response to trends.</p>
                        <p>The President has directed that a National Intelligence Estimate be
                            prepared by the intelligence community and that an options paper be
                            prepared by the Interdepartmental Group for Africa. This paper should be

                        </list>
                        <p>Admiral Anderson is just back from a trip to Italy, Greece, Turkey,
                            Cyprus, Malta and Spain. He will compare notes with Messrs. Frank
                            Lincoln and Robert Murphy before submitting a broader report in response
                            to your request for a broad look at the area from Morocco to Iran. But
                            in the meantime he has some reflections he wants to bring to your
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>His main points are:</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to North Africa.]</p>
                        <p>2. Deterioration in North Africa. Those Admiral Anderson talked with
                            emphasized the threat to Tunisia and urged that the U.S. rely more on
                            the Europeans to uphold the Free World position. More specifically in
                            this connection he learned in confidence that the Moroccan government
                            had approached the Spanish and Portuguese proposing a three-member
                            defensive “arrangement.” He believes that Soviet involvement in North
                            Africa is “more real than even our most suspicious political and
                            intelligence authorities credit” and he feels our intelligence “leaves
                            much to be desired” there.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: Possible Consequences in North Africa of U.S. Response to
                            Israeli Arms Request -</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>The President's announcement on January 30 that the decision on the
                            Israeli arms request will be made within the next thirty days, and the
                            secretary's presence in Morocco and Tunisia have focused North African
                            attention on the U.S. response in an ominous way. It is clear that the
                            North Africans expect the decision to be favorable to the Israelis and
                            that all of the governments in the area, including the moderates, would
                            be subjected to substantial pressure by local public opinion, as well as
                            by the radical Arabs, to retaliate against the United States. We believe
                            Morocco and Tunisia would endeavor to resist these pressures. However,
                            they would have to yield to them at least to some degree in view of the
                            recent evidence of the growth of public support in both countries for
                            the Palestine cause.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that a decision to postpone action on the Israeli
                            request would have a positive effect on our relations with all four
                            North African states, although not in any dramatic manner.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that we agree to provide further advanced aircraft,
                            however, we risk severe damage to U.S. interests in the area.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d7-03" facs="d7-03"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Libya</p>
                        <p>Our most exposed position is in Libya because of our important oil
                            interests, the size of our American colony and the fact that we are
                            still liquidating Wheelus. Libya's recent contract with France for the
                            purchase by the end of 1974 of “some 100” advanced aircraft has of
                            course given added momentum to the Israeli arms request. In a sense, the
                            Libyans “created” the present problem of dealing with the Israelis
                            because of their purchase of Mirages. This fact is, however, unlikely to
                            influence the Libyan reaction in view of the current superiority of the
                            Israeli Air Force and the minimum 3 to 5 year interval before the French
                            aircraft are likely to be operational.</p>
                        <p>The Libyan reaction could, at worst, mean the rupture of diplomatic
                            relations, which we doubt, or, perhaps, a request that we close our
                            Embassy office in Benghazi or our cultural centers. Pressures against
                            the American-controlled oil industry would certainly be increased, and
                            efforts to improve our bilateral relations and to expand our dialogue
                            with the regime would be severely set back. A physical attack on our
                            installations—permitted by the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>—is
                            also conceivable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tunisia and Morocco</p>
                        <p>In Tunisia and Morocco, the governments would not wish to take any direct
                            actions against U.S. interests. Popular, and particularly student,
                            discontent with the U.S. decision could, however, result in
                            demonstrations against U.S. installations: the Embassies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> centers, and possibly against Kenitra
                            (U.S. Navy communications facility in Morocco). In the longer run, these
                            same pressures might force Morocco and Tunisia to diverge increasingly
                            from their close relationship with the U.S. The Tunisian government's
                            desire to avoid a confrontation with the students during the Secretary's
                            visit and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName>'s
                            statement to the Secretary that the U.S. must assume a prime share of
                            the responsibility for Israel's aggressive attitude are two signs of the
                            erosion of the U.S. position. In both countries opposition elements are
                            seizing this issue and the regimes' ties to the U.S. to undermine
                            internal stability.</p>

                        <p>In Algeria the recent improvement in relations would suffer a setback. We
                            believe any possibility of an early resumption of relations would be
                            nullified by a decision favoring the Israelis. In view of Algeria's
                            longer term importance in North Africa, we believe it would be most
                            unfortunate if our relative isolation from the regime should be
                            prolonged.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE OUTLOOK FOR NORTH AFRICA</p>
                        <p>This estimate examines trends and prospects for the next three or four
                            years in the four North African states—Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and
                            Libya—as well as in the area as a whole.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. There are distinct limits on the likely extent of cooperation among
                            the four North African countries. They do have some common interests—a
                            regional perspective, involvement with the Islamic community, and much
                            popular sympathy for the Arab cause against Israel—and some common
                            problems—notably massive unemployment and rapidly increasing population.
                            However, each government places first priority on its own internal
                            political and economic problems. Long-standing territorial disputes
                            among Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have recently been shelved, and
                            their political relations have improved, but they are not likely to go
                            beyond a moderate degree of economic cooperation and occasional foreign
                            policy coordination. In the Arab-Israeli dispute, Algeria, Tunisia, and
                            Morocco, at least, are likely to support the Palestinians rather than
                            commit sizable resources to the regular Arab armies.</p>
                        <p>B. The North African governments are turning toward Western
                            Europe—especially France—and away from the close association with either
                            the US or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that characterized
                            their policies in the 1950s and 1960s. Attitudes toward the US are
                            likely to depend to a very large degree on how North African governments
                            interpret US policies concerning arms supply and international trade,
                            but US influence in North Africa will remain severely limited while the
                            US continues closely identified in Arab eyes with Israel and Israel
                            remains in occupation <pb n="3" xml:id="d8-03" facs="d8-03"/>of Arab
                            territory. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is unlikely
                            substantially to improve its modest political and diplomatic position in
                            North Africa, at least as long as current regimes stay in power.</p>
                        <p>C. Algeria has good prospects for political stability and economic growth
                            over the next few years. It has adequate resources—principally oil and
                            natural gas—to earn the foreign exchange required to finance its
                            1970-1973 development program, and the Boumediene regime is
                            concentrating on internal problems in a fairly competent way. Evidence
                            on the degree of political support for the government is scanty, but
                            indications of opposition have been few, and most Algerians will
                            probably remain desirous of political tranquility at least for the term
                            of this estimate.</p>
                        <p>D. In Morocco, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            focused his efforts on concentrating political power in his own hands.
                            This fact and the country's paucity of resources have resulted in
                            extremely limited social and economic progress. In time, Moroccans are
                            likely to become restive at the continuing deterioration of their
                            situation in comparison to that of their neighbors. The loyalty of the
                            armed forces to the monarchy also is likely slowly to decline. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s hold on power looks
                            to be good for some years.</p>
                        <p>E. Under Bourguiba's rule, Tunisia has made notable economic and social
                            advances, but these have been expensive, and the country faces major
                            economic and financial problems in the years ahead. Burguiba's departure
                            from power, which appears likely before long, probably will lead to a
                            period of political instability and eventually to a government more
                            authoritarian in its methods, more actively involved in the Arab cause
                            against Israel, and markedly less close to the US, than the present
                            one.</p>
                        <p>F. It seems more likely than not that Libya will experience serious
                            political turmoil in the next few years. The military junta continues to
                            display insecurity about its control over the country and uncertainty
                            about its policies. A successor government, however, probably would
                            pursue domestic and Arab policies much like those of the present regime,
                            except that it might be less susceptible to Egyptian influence.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>1. The indigenous society and culture of the area now comprising Algeria,
                            Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya have long been strongly influenced both from
                            Europe and from the Eastern Mediterranean. Trade, warfare, and power
                            politics have brought North Africa and Europe into constant contact and
                            occasional conflict throughout recorded history. The Arab conquest of
                            the eighth century made North Africa solidly Muslim and imposed Arabic
                            as the area's written language. Ottoman power also prevailed for a time,
                            although limited for the most part to ports and coastal areas. In the
                            19th and early 20th centuries, European states took over control of the
                            entire area, even settling colonists in much of it. (1)</p>
                        <p>(1) France moved into Algeria in 1830, took over Tunisia in 1881, and
                            joined with Spain to divide Morocco in 1912. Italy occupied Libya in
                            1911.</p>
                        <p>2. The colonial period had widespread and lasting effects. The Europeans
                            introduced a modern economy, operated by them for their benefit, in and
                            around the major coastal cities and in some inland areas of particular
                            fertility. They built excellent roads, communications, power facilities,
                            and other infrastructure items, largely in those areas. Marked dualism
                            developed between modern and traditional economies, the latter
                            supporting the vast majority of the indigenous population. In the
                            French-controlled states, French language, culture, and education became
                            widespread; the language in particular was the passport required for
                            those local inhabitants who aspired to move into the European-dominated
                            sectors of the economy and society. To a considerable extent this has
                            continued to the present time, and European influence remains
                            substantial. In Libya, however, where the Italians enforced a form of
                            segregation, the cultural impact was superficial. In the aftermath of
                            independence, Libya came under the cultural, social, and even political
                            influence of the Arab states to the east—particularly Egypt—to a degree
                            not seen in the other North African countries.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither Arab nor European conquest obliterated the special character
                            of North Africa. The indigenous Berber tribes were not absorbed by
                            foreigners over the centuries; rather they accommodated to their
                            conquerors and often assimilated them, and Berber stock remains
                            identifiable throughout much of the area. The Muslim religion practiced
                            in North Africa is characterized both by pre-Islamic practices and by a
                            tendency toward extremist sects and heresies. Most important, the people
                            in all four countries share a sense of common identity which owes much
                            to the interaction of European, Arab, and Berber influences.</p>
                        <p>4. As independent nations, however, the four North African states have
                            moved along paths that emphasize their individuality rather than their
                            similarity. In <pb n="5" xml:id="d8-05" facs="d8-05"/>large measure,
                            this is because they had somewhat different colonial experiences,
                            reached independence by different paths, chose disparate political
                            systems and philosophies, and followed dissimilar methods of economic
                            organization and management. They have common interests—a certain
                            regional perspective, involvement with the Islamic community, and
                            support for the Arab cause against Israel—and common problems—notably
                            massive unemployment and about a three percent annual increase in
                            population.(2) At present, however, each North African government places
                            first priority on internal problems of political and economic control.
                            Accordingly, it seems appropriate to consider first the domestic
                            situation in the four countries and then relations among them and with
                            foreign states.</p>
                        <p>(2) Current populations of the North African countries are estimated as
                            follows: Algeria—13.6 million, Morocco-15.3 million, Tunisia—4.8
                            million, Libya-1.9 million.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. ALGERIA</p>
                        <p>5. The Algerian struggle for independence was long, bloody, and extremely
                            destructive; when it ended, half a million people were dead and some 20
                            to 25 percent of the indigenous population was displaced. The managerial
                            and organizational structure of Algeria was almost totally disrupted by
                            the departure of a million Europeans. Under the best of circumstances,
                            the early years of independence would have been difficult; as events
                            transpired, they were extremely painful. The loss of French managers and
                            consumers and the disruption of daily life led to a sharp and continuing
                            economic decline. Ben Bella's ambitious attempts to acquire
                            international status diverted attention from domestic needs, and
                            ideological squabbling among his intimates interfered with governmental
                            decisions on a wide range of domestic and foreign matters.</p>
                        <p>6. Since taking power in 1965, Boumediene has concentrated Algerian
                            efforts more on internal matters. He has not abandoned Algeria's strong
                            interest in various national liberation movements, but he has not
                            allowed support for such movements to interfere with important Algerian
                            concerns. He has continued to object to the US role in Vietnam, but he
                            has not let this deter him from seeking advice and expertise from US
                            business firms. And he has taken diplomatic initiatives that have led
                            his neighbors to shelve their claims on Algerian territory, so that
                            potential border incidents are no longer likely to flare up and demand
                            an Algerian reaction.</p>
                        <p>7. Executive and legislative power rests with Boumediene and a few close
                            associates. The armed forces remain the basic constituency of the regime
                            and ultimate arbiter of power, and senior military leaders are consulted
                            on major policy questions, but overt military involvement in
                            governmental affairs appears to have diminished. The 75,000 man military
                            establishment that was built up after independence has not been
                            significantly expanded in the past several years. Boumediene retains the
                            post of Defense Minister and controls the military through a chosen
                            lieutenant; although himself a product of the army, he now operates an
                            essentially civilian government. The current regime has emphasized <pb
                                n="6" xml:id="d8-06" facs="d8-06"/>results rather than ideology;
                            organization and discipline of the bureaucracy have improved; and young,
                            pragmatic technocrats are increasingly influential. These improvements
                            notwithstanding, government efficiency still suffers from the
                            after-effects of the independence struggle and the relative inexperience
                            of the present administrators. Jockeying for power within the
                            establishment persists, and overstaffing of government agencies is
                            chronic. All things considered, however, the Bomediene regime has
                            substantially improved administrative competence.</p>
                        <p>8. Since 1967, the Algerian economy has achieved a real annual growth
                            rate of about six percent, owing partly to the government's actions. The
                            new regime put Algeria's formerly chaotic finances in order. Rising
                            foreign exchange receipts—oil revenues and remittances of 500,000
                            Algerian workers in France—combined with tight restrictions on consumer
                            imports and a cautious approach to new investment, led to a steady
                            accumulation of reserves, which exceeded $600 million at the end of
                            1969. The Algerians are showing a new willingness to compete for export
                            markets, and semiautonomous state-owned firms now manage nationalized
                            businesses and are replacing the costly worker-management system that
                            had sprung up after independence. During the past year or so, work on
                            investment projects has greatly accelerated and it now seems likely that
                            the bulk of future increases in foreign exchange earnings will be spent
                            to promote economic development.</p>
                        <p>9. Algeria seems in a position to maintain its economic momentum, at
                            least for the next several years. Projects already under way or
                            completed will permit the production and export of sufficient petroleum
                            and natural gas to finance the 1970-1973 development plan without resort
                            to heavy foreign borrowing. Petroleum production, now at the rate of
                            about 900,000 barrels per day, is likely to increase at an average rate
                            of 5 to 10 percent annually. Output of exportable natural gas is
                            scheduled to rise from 1.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually to 5
                            billion during the same period. (3) France has contracted to increase
                            its annual gas purchases from 0.5 bcm to 4 bcm and a French market for
                            at least half of total oil production seems assured. By 1973, Algeria's
                            annual foreign exchange earnings will include about $800-$900 million
                            from oil and about $100 million from natural gas. Locally available fuel
                            also provides a cheap energy source for Algerian industry. Thus a
                            continued growth rate of about 6 percent (3 percent per capita) over the
                            next several years appears attainable within Algerian financial
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>(3) Under a tentative agreement between Algeria and the El Paso Natural
                            Gas Co., export to the US of 10 bcm/year of Algerian natural gas for 25
                            years is scheduled to begin in November 1973. Financing of the facilties
                            for this additional production has not yet been arranged.</p>
                        <p>10. The 1970-1973 development plan emphasizes capital intensive industry
                            that will provide new employment opportunities and better living
                            standards for relatively few people. During this period, the regime is
                            depending on minor investments in the traditional agriculture sector,
                            labor exportation, and outright dole as temporary expedients to retard
                            migration to the cities and to cushion <pb n="7" xml:id="d8-07"
                                facs="d8-07"/>the effects of unemployment. Agriculture is slated to
                            receive relatively little investment in the next few years; in the
                            absence of strong governmental efforts, farming will continue to provide
                            only a scant livelihood for the bulk of the population at least through
                            this decade.</p>
                        <p>11. The outlook for the Algerian economy beyond the mid-1970s is
                            uncertain. Beginning in 1973, the government intends to channel public
                            investment into light industry and other sectors, with the object of
                            achieving full employment within a decade. In these circumstances,
                            substantial alleviation of the unemployment problem is years away.
                            Realization of these governmental intentions, moreover, depends on
                            continuing growth of foreign exchange earnings and hence on locating
                            adequate new deposits of oil and the requisite markets for oil and
                            natural gas.</p>
                        <p>12. Our evidence on the degree of political support for the government is
                            scanty; certainly outward manifestations of opposition have been few in
                            recent years. Boumediene apparently does not seek a charismatic image
                            and certainly does not project one, but neither does his diffident
                            manner inspire antagonism. He is gradually erecting a set of largely
                            powerless representative institutions and is moving to bring the trade
                            union, student organizations, and other special interest groups under
                            closer government control. The adult population has passively accepted
                            these initiatives; it will probably remain war weary and in no mood to
                            support revolution or civil uprising that could lead to widespread
                            bloodshed. Students and unemployed youth, although attracted by the
                            regime's revolutionary slogans, dislike its authoritarian style. Their
                            opposition will probably flare up periodically, although it does not
                            pose the same threat as would factional strife within the army and
                            regime. We cannot rule out either assassination or a coup—with
                            unpredictable results—but we think the present regime has a good chance
                            of continuing to govern Algeria for some years to come.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. MOROCCO</p>
                        <p>13. In nine years of rule, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has successfully gathered all political power
                            into his own hands and is intent on maintaining this position. He
                            clearly seeks to protect himself from such modern movements as
                            republicanism, socialism, and pan-Arab nationalism. Whereas for a time
                            after Independence in 1956 the political system was responsive to a
                            wider range of interest groups, it has been greatly narrowed. Some
                            political parties are permitted to exist, to hold meetings, and to
                            publish newspapers (subject to frequent suspension). Otherwise,
                            political activity has been suspended since June 1965, and the King has
                            given no sign that he intends to end this “state of exception,” at least
                            until he is confident that he has arranged to control a future
                            parliament. He relies on traditional palace advisers and increasingly on
                            a group of key officials, many of rural Berber origins. Hasan has placed
                            these individuals in positions of authority in the armed forces,
                            security apparatus, local administration, and major economic
                            sectors.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d8-08" facs="d8-08"/>
                        <p>14. The King is anxious to preserve the foundations of his political
                            control. Hence he has chosen to refurbish traditionally loyalist
                            institutions and to resist social and economic innovations. The
                            overriding attention which the palace gives to political matters has
                            been one factor leading to limited educational opportunities and health
                            facilities in Morocco. Expenditures in these fields are the lowest in
                            the area on a per capita basis; in literacy rate (about 15 percent) and
                            in the proportion of children attending school, Morocco does roughly
                            half as well as the other North African countries. Similarly the primacy
                            of political goals, combined with limited resources and undependable
                            weather, have resulted in a decade of economic stagnation in Morocco.
                            Since Independence, Morocco has received about $1.5 billion in foreign
                            aid, including some $80 million from the US. Rapid population growth,
                            however, has absorbed most economic gains, and per capita income has
                            remained roughly what it was in 1960.</p>
                        <p>15. Future economic prospects are no brighter. The development plan for
                            1968-1972 envisages the highest investment level in Moroccan history but
                            aims for a growth rate of only 4 percent; since population is growing at
                            about 3.3 percent annually, fulfillment of the plan would raise per
                            capita incomes by only about one-half of 1 percent per year. Even the
                            modest objectives for the 4 year period will not necessarily be
                            achieved. Goals are predicated on adequate rainfall throughout the plan
                            period, whereas periodic droughts are to be expected in Morocco.
                            Economic growth in the first year of the plan period was 12 to 13
                            percent, thanks to an excellent harvest after 2 years of drought, but
                            total output declined in 1969. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has been extremely reluctant either to force
                            domestic savings and investment or to born abroad on anything except
                            concessional terms. Annual investment targets involving roughly $150
                            million from foreign sources and $250 million from domestic sources,
                            therefore, may not be met.</p>
                        <p>16. There is little reason to expect that <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s grip on the levers of power will be broken in
                            the near future. His roots and those of the dynasty are deep; his
                            position as religious leader of the Moroccans supplements his temporal
                            role and binds his people to him, especially in the countryside. The
                            King's favored appointees are well rewarded and are not likely to mount
                            a threat to the throne. Because <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s father became a leading symbol of the
                            independence movement, anticolonialism did not become antimonarchical;
                            this is an important element in the royal family's strength. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is fully aware that the
                            principal danger lies in the discontented elements in the cities and
                            universities. Occasional outbursts of trouble are likely, but he has
                            shown himself willing firmly to suppress demonstrations and disturbances
                            before they can attract widespread support. Politicians who speak out
                            against him or against existing conditions or policies are harassed,
                            placed under house arrest, or jailed. With a deft combination of force
                            and favor, he probably can suppress or buy off potential dissidents for
                            at least several years to come.</p>
                        <p>17. Over the longer run, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            ability to retain his throne is open to serious question. Moroccans will
                            come to see that the comparison between Morocco <pb n="9" xml:id="d8-09"
                                facs="d8-09"/>and its neighbors, in social and economic areas at
                            least, increasingly favors the latter. People have been streaming into
                            overcrowded city slums since World War II, and there are no serious
                            attempts at present to devise ways to hold them to the land or to
                            provide housing or jobs in the cities. As the cities grow in size,
                            discontent will probably increase and repression will become more
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>18. Moreover, the loyalty of the armed forces to the monarchy is likely
                            to decline over time. Even today, a carefully hatched plot along Libyan
                            lines cannot be ruled out. The urban elite have recognized the military
                            as a promising career for their sons, and young men from educated,
                            relatively progressive and sophisticated city families have entered the
                            officer corps. If the King denies these young officers access to the top
                            ranks and continues to favor the rural Berber element in the armed
                            forces, he eventually will increase, rather than diminish, the threat to
                            himself. If he died, or even if he were overthrown, the elements which
                            now support his regime might be able to work together to maintain
                            control. But whether this occurred, or whether presently suppressed
                            radical elements succeeded in coming to power, would depend on the
                            circumstances of <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            departure and the political situation at the time, including the
                            attitudes and power of the military.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. TUNISIA</p>
                        <p>19. Since independence, Tunisia has been led by Habib Bourguiba, a
                            product of the urban middle class who thinks and acts much like a French
                            politician of the 1930s. Bourguiba's style has always been dramatic and
                            abrupt; he has leapt forward with new ideas, then inched backward to a
                            level of innovation that his countrymen would tolerate. Rather than use
                            religious tradition to bolster his own position, he has openly advocated
                            discarding the trappings of medieval Islam. He has been equally
                            innovative in economic affairs—vineyards have been uprooted to make way
                            for other crops, communal farming has been introduced, new industries
                            have sprung up throughout the small country. Tunisia has embarked on a
                            widespread birth control program and has poured money into education and
                            health.</p>
                        <p>20. To date the results of this activist approach have been mixed. On the
                            positive side, the economy has grown at an annual rate of almost 4.5
                            percent for the past decade, while the rate of population growth—though
                            it has risen slowly—is about 2.8 percent. Industry now provides about 15
                            percent of the national product, compared to about 10 percent at
                            independence. Over half of the eligible children are in school, and
                            literacy is increasing rapidly. The Destourian Socialist Party began as
                            a pre-independence popular movement and has functioned reasonably well.
                            Elections have been held on schedule and, within the limits of a one
                            party system, have provided a modicum of choice and a minimum of
                            violence. Tunisia has stayed largely aloof from the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict and has maintained peaceful, if not always amicable, relations
                            with its neighbors; resources that might have been absorbed by a large
                            military establishment have been put to civilian use.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d8-10" facs="d8-10"/>
                        <p>21. Yet, Tunisia's progress is no more a guarantee of a promising future
                            than Morocco's relative stagnation is of imminent revolution. Success
                            has been costly in both monetary and social terms. Maintaining and
                            expanding the economy has absorbed over $1 billion in foreign aid
                            (including about $600 million from the US) since independence and the
                            gap between foreign earnings and foreign expenditures has seldom fallen
                            below $100 million per annum. Tourism has begun to bring in foreign
                            revenues, but it cannot hope to earn enough to replace aid for years.
                            Economic problems are likely to present a major challenge to any
                            Tunisian government in the next few years. An immediate concern is to
                            repair extensive damage to roads, railways, and farms caused by
                            disastrous floods in 1969. Most of the relatively easy opportunities for
                            stimulating growth have already been seized; the country has been
                            exhaustively explored for new mineral resources without much success.
                            Foreign debt service charges have more than doubled in the past five
                            years and will remain high at least for several years to come. Private
                            foreign investment has been discouraged by a government which has
                            nationalized or collectivized virtually the entire economy; only tourism
                            has remained in private hands and attractive to foreign investors.</p>
                        <p>22. The Bourguiba regime has already begun to reverse the extreme policy
                            of forced agricultural collectivization, started by former economic czar
                            Ahmed Ben Salah, which had aroused strong opposition. The balance
                            between collectively owned and individually owned agricultural land
                            probably will shift back somewhat in favor of the independent farmer,
                            and there are pressures which may over the long term bring some return
                            to private ownership in such fields as retail trade. Even such minor
                            corrections, however, will antagonize that element in Tunisian society
                            (principally confined to the universities at present) which believes
                            that <persName corresp="#p_BSA1">Ben Salah</persName>'s program would
                            have been successful if pursued to its conclusion. In any event,
                            socialism in some form is likely to remain the dominant economic
                            philosophy. Moreover, inability to attract sufficient foreign aid and
                            other capital to finance foreign exchange requirements is likely to
                            force Tunisian to retrench economically; the need for enforcing
                            austerity is likely, in turn, to lend to more authoritarian political
                            methods.</p>
                        <p>23. If <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> were still
                            in full vigor, Tunisia probably could get through several more years
                            without severe political trouble. However, he has been seriously ill
                            several times in the past two years; his age (67), general health, and
                            apparent loss of political acumen make it extremely doubtful that he
                            will be able effectively to direct Tunisian affairs much longer. None of
                            his close associates appears to have the personality and political savvy
                            necessary to make the system work when he is gone. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Bahi Ladgham</persName>, whom Bourguiba
                            has appointed as successor, has been running the day-to-day business of
                            the government for some months but he has shown himself to be somewhat
                            indecisive, compromising among various functions in a manner that
                            satisfies no one.</p>
                        <p>24. While <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName> probably will
                            become the titular head of government when Bourguiba leaves the scene,
                            we doubt that he will be able to maintain control for long. He will be
                            challenged by younger elements within his party <pb n="11"
                                xml:id="d8-11" facs="d8-11"/>who are impatient at the party's
                            growing immobilism and eager for power. There will be challenges from
                            without the party—e.g., by men expelled from it for failure to follow
                            Bourguiba's command and by presently embryonic ideological movements
                            among students. The military, which has exerted virtually no influence
                            on government policy, might seek a political voice in a post-Bourguiba
                            government. The likely course of such challenges is unclear; much will
                            depend on the time and circumstances of Bourguiba's departure. We
                            believe, however, that a post-Bourguiba government is likely to be more
                            authoritarian in its methods and more in tune with Arab world trends
                            than the present one.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">LIBYA</p>
                        <p>25.After six months in power, Libya's Revolutionary Command Council
                                (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) continues to display a sense
                            of insecurity about its position and uncertainty about its domestic and
                            foreign policies. There are indications of disagreement within the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and of discontent within the
                            country, focusing most notably on relations between Libya and Egypt.
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> President Qaddafi's advocacy of
                            extremely close relations with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> and his transfer of Libyan troops to Egypt have
                            already caused one split within the leadership. In the face of
                            persistent opposition from other members of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>, he has temporized. The Egyptian presence in Libya has
                            remained for some time at the level of about 1,500 troops and about 500
                            advisers, mostly civilians. If Qaddafi is willing to play down his
                            affinity for Egypt, he probably can remove the most serious immediate
                            cause of domestic opposition.</p>
                        <p>26. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s actions so far have
                            underscored both the Libyan and the Arab character of the revolution but
                            have shown no other consistent pattern. It is clearly determined to
                            identify with the militant Arab line toward Israel and has increased its
                            financial contributions to Egypt. It insisted on the early termination
                            of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military presence. It
                            completed the Libyanization of foreign-owned banks which had begun under
                            the monarchy. It introduced partial prohibition, presumably out of
                            deference to Islamic fundamentalism. It removed foreign-language signs
                            and deleted English language courses from the school curriculum. It
                            carried out widespread arrests of politicians, businessmen, and senior
                            military personnel associated with the old regime. It also began
                            negotiations—originally scheduled by the Idris government—for an upward
                            revision of the price structure on which Libyan oil revenues are
                            calculated. It turned almost immediately to France for military aircraft
                            but continued to seek tanks from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>;
                            if the British refuse the Libyan bid, France is likely to be asked for
                            tanks and other equipment as well.</p>
                        <p>27. We have little to go on in assessing likely political developments in
                            Libya over the longer term. <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has now
                            installed its own members in the key cabinet posts and has improved its
                            ability to monitor the daily activities of the bureaucracy. It is
                            apparently making an effort to avoid exacerbating tribal or regional
                            tensions and rivalries. It has purged the military of followers of the
                            old regime, who would almost certainly have been a threat to the new
                            order, <pb n="12" xml:id="d8-12" facs="d8-12"/>but it probably has
                            failed to identify the potential dissidents among officers who remain on
                            active duty. Moreover, there are divisions even among the junta. It
                            seems more likely than not that Libya will experience serious political
                            turmoil in the next few years, but there is little basis for predicting
                            the various circumstances and contingencies that might arise. Economic
                            problems per se are not likely to bring on domestic strife, thanks to
                            Libya's very large oil revenues, which amounted to some $1 billion in
                            1969. If a part of the present <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> were
                            to seize control or if another group of officers should move in, the
                            odds are that a successor government would pursue domestic and Arab
                            policies—except perhaps in regard to Egypt—much like those of the
                            present regime.</p>
                        <p>28. A Libyan attempt to nationalize oil production does not appear
                            likely. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out, especially in the
                            event of major Arab-Israeli military hostilities. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is deeply committed to the Arab cause,
                            and oil is the major weapon at Libyan disposal. An embargo of oil
                            shipments to certain countries is much more likely in such circumstances
                            than is nationalization. Selective oil embargos, however, are relatively
                            easy to circumvent, especially in view of the many alternative sources
                            of oil. Should Libya choose to attempt nationalization, it is in a
                            unique position to carry through without severe damage to itself.
                            Twenty-five percent of the crude oil imported in 1968 by the European
                            Common Market countries—and 43 percent of West German imports—came from
                            Libya. Independent oil companies in importing countries would probably
                            not refuse to buy oil from nationalized companies, as long as the price
                            remained competitive. Furthermore, Libya has accumulated foreign
                            exchange reserves adequate to ride out a lengthy period during which it
                            could seek new customers; imports other than oil field equipment could
                            be maintained at current levels for roughly two years with the funds
                            Libya now has on hand. The strong Libyan position in regard to
                            nationalization will diminish in a year or two with rising oil
                            production from the Gulf of Guinea—principally Nigeria—and with
                            substantial increases in world tanker tonnage. In any event, with Libyan
                            financial support for Egypt now running at a high level, (4) Arab
                            solidarity may act more to protect than to threaten Western oil
                            interests.</p>

                        <p>29. The recent shelving of long-standing territorial claims among the
                            French-speaking states of North Africa have markedly improved their
                            political relations. These disputes, which kept tensions high and even
                            provoked border clashes, have now been formally resolved or set aside at
                            Algeria's initiative. Since January 1969, Algeria has concluded treaties
                            with Morocco and with Tunisia that call for permanent peace between the
                            parties, renunciation of force in the case of disputes, and
                            non-adherence by either party to any pact or coalition directed against
                                <pb n="13" xml:id="d8-13" facs="d8-13"/>the other. Boumediene also
                            has helped promote contacts that have led to Morocco's formal
                            recognition of Mauritania, thus, in effect, renouncing long-standing
                            Moroccan claims to that country. And Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania
                            appear willing to cooperate with Morocco in pressing Spain to relinquish
                            political control of the Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>30. With territorial issues shelved, the North African countries may move
                            forward on economic collaboration. For example, iron ore deposits in
                            Algeria would become profitable to exploit if transportation across
                            Morocco to the Atlantic could be arranged. Negotiations for a
                            preferential trade zone in North Africa (perhaps including Mauritania)
                            were slated to resume in March 1970 but were postponed; if such an
                            agreement eventually is reached, it would afford some small advantages
                            to each of the participants. However, all of the North African countries
                            are concerned principally with their internal problems and have a
                            distinct sense of their own individuality; moreover, their international
                            economic interests are divergent. For these reasons, a moderate degree
                            of economic and occasional foreign policy coordination represents the
                            likely limit of their cooperation.</p>
                        <p>31. The revolution in Libya, however, has helped to stimulate cooperation
                            among the other North African states, and future events in Libya will
                            have a substantial impact throughout the area. For Morocco and Tunisia,
                            the Libyan revolution was a blow, raising the specter of the overthrow
                            of conservative governments by radicals and removing one more country
                            from the dwindling ranks of Arab states maintaining an avowedly
                            pro-Western foreign policy. The Algerian Government probably cheered the
                            revolution, but the subsequent increase of Egyptian influence in Libya
                            was no more welcome in Algiers than in Rabat or Tunis. Algeria would
                            like to have Libya as a collaborator on oil policy and an independent
                            member of the Arab family, rather than a stooge or tool of Cairo.
                            Morocco and Tunisia are worried about Libya as a possible base for
                            Egyptian—and perhaps eventually Soviet—subversion. There are clear
                            signs, however, that the present Libyan leaders are strongly opposed to
                            both communist ideology and Soviet tutelage and that some are equally
                            fearful of Egyptian intentions. If Libyan nationalists prevail in
                            Tripoli, the other countries will be somewhat reassured. On the other
                            hand, if Libya pursues a pro-Egyptian course, this will probably lead to
                            greater political collaboration among Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>32. Since 1967, the Arab-Israeli dispute has increasingly engaged the
                            attentions of the North African states. Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco do
                            not wish to become deeply involved but, for reasons of both domestic and
                            inter-Arab politics, cannot afford to remain entirely aloof. They wish
                            to minimize the commitment of their resources to the buildup of regular
                            Arab armies arrayed against Israel, which they probably see as a futile
                            effort; hence, their support has been given principally to the
                            Palestinians. Algeria's long-standing support for the fedayeen is likely
                            to continue and increase. Both Morocco and Tunisia will probably step up
                            somewhat their financial and verbal support for the Palestinian
                            cause.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d8-14" facs="d8-14"/>
                        <p>33. The new Libyan regime has chosen to join the ranks of the militant
                            Arabs and to increase its financial contribution to the cause. Libya's
                            military forces are very small. The regime has arranged to purchase over
                            100 jet aircraft from France, but the bulk of these planes are not
                            scheduled for delivery for some years. Moreover, their effective
                            operational use will require extended training for pilots and
                            maintenance personnel and establishment of an adequate ground support
                            system. Even if Libyan planes were made available to Egypt, Egypt lacks
                            the personnel to operate them. Hence, Libyan planes will not materially
                            affect Arab military capabilities against Israel at least for the next
                            three or four years.</p>
                        <p>34. In the event of another major round of Arab-Israeli hostilities, the
                            extent of North African participation would depend in part on the
                            duration of the fighting. If it dragged on long enough to make
                            reinforcement possible (or the failure to send reinforcements too
                            obvious), Algerian and Libyan units certainly would be provided, and
                            probably Moroccan and Tunisian ones as well. The depth of popular
                            emotion in all the North African countries probably would compel such
                            actions, although Tunis and Rabat, at any rate, would move
                            reluctantly.</p>
                        <p>35. By and large, the North African countries play only a limited role in
                            Arab and African affairs. Algeria's national oil company has cooperation
                            agreements with national oil companies in Yemen, South Yemen, and Iraq
                            and has proposed similar arrangements with Libya and Syria. Both Arab
                            and Islamic summits have recently been held in Morocco. The Algerians
                            and Tunisians have occasionally exchanged visits with some ruling
                            political parties in Arab states. No major expansion of such activity is
                            likely. Under Qaddafi, Libya is actively cultivating closer relations
                            with the Eastern Arabs, especially Egypt and the Sudan. Libya's money,
                            however, is likely to be more consequential than its political role.</p>
                        <p>36. All four North African states belong to the Organization of African
                            Unity, and all but Libya have on occasion been quite active in African
                            affairs. These interests, however, have never been great; the vast
                            desert that separates black from North Africa and the wide disparities
                            of culture and race give the two areas little in common. Algeria
                            sympathizes with and provides office space and subsidies for the
                            representatives of a score of liberation movements, e.g., those of
                            Angola and Mozambique. It also cooperates to some extent with the Cubans
                            in such ventures. In general, however, Algerian enthusiasm for these
                            groups has declined in recent years and is unlikely to increase.</p>

                        <p>37. The Soviet Union is unlikely to make substantial political and
                            diplomatic gains in North Africa while current regimes remain in power.
                            The new Libyan regime has already brushed aside several Soviet arms
                            offers and has recently inspired Libyan newspapers to launch an
                            anticommunist press campaign. <pb n="15" xml:id="d8-15" facs="d8-15"
                            />The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cannot expect greatly
                            enhanced influence in either Morocco or Tunisia under existing regimes;
                            even in the event of a revolution in either country, any growth of
                            Soviet influence would be limited by North African suspicions,
                            traditional cultural and economic ties to Western Europe, and fear of
                            Soviet-Egyptian collaboration. The Egyptians, for their part, do not
                            appear to favor a greater Soviet role in Libya.</p>
                        <p>38. Over the past year or so, relations between Algeria and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have cooled. The Algerians apparently
                            have rebuffed Soviet requests for some sort of naval facility and have
                            repeatedly called for the withdrawal of the fleets of non-Mediterranean
                            powers from the Mediterranean Sea. Boumediene appears to be making a
                            deliberate effort to limit Soviet influence in Algeria; he has recently
                            concluded a small military procurement and training agreement with
                            France that is evidently the beginning of an attempt to diversify
                            sources of arms procurement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. EUROPE</p>
                        <p>39. France is likely to expand its already substantial influence in North
                            Africa in the years ahead. Recent French policy initiatives appeal to
                            the North Africans. Among them are an emphasis on the role of the
                            Palestinians in the Arab-Israeli dispute, the embargo on arms sales to
                            Israel, and willingness to sell arms to some Arab customers. France
                            favors eventual withdrawal of non-riparian naval forces from the
                            Mediterranean and may indeed be orchestrating a campaign to that end.
                            The small sale of French arms to Algeria and the subsequent multimillion
                            dollar aircraft deal with Libya will probably be followed by further
                            arms sales in North Africa. Over 600,000 North Africans presently work
                            in France and this number may rise somewhat. The French Government
                            undoubtedly will attempt to promote the commercial interests of French
                            oil companies and other French businesses in North Africa. France is
                            also likely to court North Africa by providing increased technical
                            assistance, by continuing to buy North African products, and by
                            promoting North African efforts to expand preferential access to the
                            European Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>40. This is not to say that relations between France and the North
                            African countries will be uniformly smooth. Even during De Gaulle's day,
                            there were serious and unresolved disagreements between Algeria and
                            France—notably over French reneging on a contract to purchase Algerian
                            wine. Other bilateral problems are likely to arise in the next few
                            years. In addition, impending renegotiation of Franco-Algerian oil
                            agreements is bound to cause some frictions between the two. France has
                            recently normalized relations with Morocco and made some conciliatory
                            gestures toward Tunisia as well. It is likely to increase economic and
                            military aid to both—though probably not as much as they would like. The
                            North African countries will continue to compete with one another for
                            the French market—a major recipient of their oil and agricultural
                            goods—and will seek special favors at one another's expense. Thus
                            periodic strains in relations among the North African states and in
                            dealings between France and individual states are likely.</p>

                        <p>41. A further diversification of North Africa's international ties is
                            likely in the 1970s. While West Germany, Italy, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are not likely to equal France or the US
                            in diplomatic, political, or economic influence in the area, all three
                            are likely to improve their position. Spain will also try to cultivate
                            its Arab neighbors, but it is not likely to accede to Moroccan desires
                            for control of the Spanish Sahara; relations between Spai n and North
                            Africa, therefore, are likely to remain cool.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. The US </p>
                        <p>42. US relations with Morocco and Tunisia are cordial; the US has
                            important commercial interests in Libya and Algeria but official
                            relations only with the former. Friendly government to government
                            relations are almost certain to persist between the US and Morocco and
                            Tunisia, at least as long as the present regimes remain in power there.
                            Both regimes look to US friendship as in some measure a bulwark against
                            domestic as well as foreign enemies. Beyond this, attitudes of all four
                            countries toward the US are likely to depend to a very large degree on
                            how they interpret and react to US policies and actions on matters going
                            beyond North Africa itself. Among these are, for example, the question
                            of arms sales to Israel and diplomatic positions in the Arab-Israeli
                            issue, support or opposition to North African countries association with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> (since the US is formulating a
                            single policy toward all such applications), US policies on imports of
                            oil and natural gas (the latter affecting a tentative arrangement for
                            the sale of $1.4 billion worth of Algerian gas in the US over the next
                            25 years), and the general availability of foreign aid and
                            investments.</p>
                        <p>43. So long as the US remains closely identified in Arab eyes with Israel
                            and Israel remains in occupation of Arab territory, any substantial
                            growth of US influence in North Africa is highly unlikely. Indeed,
                            frictions and irritations are almost certain to recur at frequent
                            intervals. However, if the Arab-Israeli issue does not flare up into
                            widespread new hostilities, we anticipate a continued gradual warming of
                            Algerian-US commercial relations. The existing governments of Tunisia
                            and Morocco will continue to cooperate with the US, but perhaps less
                            readily than in the past; warming North African relations with France,
                            reductions in the level of US aid, and growing doubt in both Tunisia and
                            Morocco about American willingness to actively defend the regimes will
                            all work to loosen ties to the US. In sum, now that the shock of
                            independence and decolonization have been weathered, the North African
                            states are once again turning toward Western Europe and deemphasizing
                            the close association with either the US or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">SITUATION IN NORTH AFRICA</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The North African Countries</p>
                        <p>— Morocco seems likely, barring assassination, to remain in the hands of
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, but his ability—or
                            that of a conservative successor government—to survive over the longer
                            run remains open to serious question as long as he refuses to permit
                            significant socio-political innovation. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> still regards the U.S. as a major patron.</p>
                        <p>— Algeria's “revolutionary” government is more pragmatic in practice than
                            its rhetoric would suggest. Although far from effective in management
                            and still occasionally vocal on international issues and active in
                            supporting some liberation movements, it has become increasingly
                            introspective and concerned with domestic development. One measure of
                            this pragmatism is a strong continuing relationship with U.S. business
                            despite the absence of official diplomatic relations. Boumedienne seems
                            wary of too heavy a dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> or France and interested in adding other strings to
                            his diplomatic bow. In the long run, Algeria seems likely to aspire to
                            regional hegemony.</p>
                        <p>— Tunisia has been the most innovative and in many ways the most
                            effective of the North African countries in terms of its own political
                            and economic management. It has also been the most outspoken in
                            supporting U.S. foreign policy positions. With President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s illness, however, Tunisia
                            has entered a delicate transitional stage politically. The government is
                            likely to emerge—at the very least—less in tune with the U.S. and more
                            Arab in outlook and rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>— Libya is still something of a question mark because its revolutionary
                            government is still inexperienced and threatened by challenges from
                            within. There seems no question that it will remain close to Arab causes
                            in posture and in providing <pb n="2" xml:id="d9-02" facs="d9-02"
                            />financial support. One tempering element will be Libya's dependence on
                            oil revenues and desire to save a substantial proportion of them for
                            Libya's own use. Nationalization of the oil companies seems a less
                            likely prospect that severe truncation of past concessional
                            arrangements, for the government seems interested in creating an image
                            of putting the companies in their place without upsetting working
                            arrangements if they can.</p>
                        <p>— In general, U.S. intelligence feels that it does not seem likely that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will achieve the degree of
                            dominance that would be required for achievement of its strategic
                            objectives in North Africa in the absence of some seriously
                            destabilizing series of events such as prolonged military conflict
                            between Arabs and Israelis, or western disengagement from North
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>— The basic U.S. interest is negative: That neither the region as a whole
                            nor any of the countries there be dominated by a hostile power capable
                            of effective military action against NATOinterests.</p>
                        <p>— The U.S. strategic interest is, therefore, derivative. Libya and
                            Algeria are major petroleum suppliers to France and West Germany. The
                            Mediterranean sea lanes are essential to the protection of southern
                            Europe. A significant Soviet military position in North Africa could
                            complicate NATO defense by multiplying its military problems and
                            exposing Spain and other southern European countries to a more direct
                            threat. The psychological impact on the Alliance could also be
                            significant.</p>
                        <p>— Without strategic access through the Mediterranean the U.S. would be
                            cut off from the Middle East. The alternative land and air access would
                            depend in large measure on military rights we might enjoy in Spain;
                            routes to the north would be less certain.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d9-03" facs="d9-03"/>
                        <p>—- Present U.S. economic interests are concentrated in Libya (2.5% of
                            total U.S. overseas direct investment by book value) where oil
                            investments return about $750 million net to our balance of payments.
                            There is a much smaller but growing interest in Algeria. Both countries
                            offer modest prospects for U.S. trade over the longer run.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Summary of key trends.</p>
                        <p>— There will be opportunities for the U.S. private sector to build a
                            network of relationships in North Africa, but all American interests
                            will be subject to intermittent pressures to the extent the U.S. is
                            identified in the Arab mind as anti-Arab and pro-Israeli.</p>
                        <p>— The trend toward militancy on both domestic and Mid-Eastern issues
                            seems clear; the political consequences will depend in part on the
                            ability of incumbent governments to satisfy rising domestic and social
                            expectations as well as on events in the area.</p>
                        <p>— France has decided to give primary strategic attention to North Africa.
                            North Africa may become again more accessible to Western European
                            influence than it was in the immediate post-independence period of the
                            early 1960's.</p>
                        <p>— The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has met only limited
                            successes in North Africa despite its pro-Arab positions. The future
                            will depend on the extent of satisfactory European-North African
                            relationships and the course of events in the Near East.</p>
                        <p>— Détente in the Maghreb is welcome but fragile, at least in the short
                            term. While limited cooperation may be possible in economic fields, the
                            most serious long-term impediment may be the latent Algerian tendency to
                            seek regional hegemony.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d9-04" facs="d9-04"/>
                        <p>— In short, a relative decline in the US position can be expected over
                            the next 3-5 years because of warming North African relations with
                            Europe, the downward trend in U.S. assistance, the U.S. identification
                            with Israel.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">OPERATIONAL ISSUES</p>
                        <p>Apart from the question of general U.S. posture toward North Africa, a
                            number of operational issues are before the U.S.</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_USN1">USN</gloss> Communications Station in Kenitra,
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>This is an important part of the system used to communicate with US naval
                            forces in the Mediterranean and with CINCSTRIKE forces that might be
                            deployed into the area. [text not declassified] Moving the facility to
                            Spain would cost at least $9 million and operations might be degraded.
                            There is no immediate question about the tenure of this facility, but a
                            lessening of U.S. aid or a change in Morocco's political posture would
                            raise one. The question is whether we should begin relocating or wait
                            till pressures develop.</p>
                        <p>B. Libyan F-5's. In June 1969 the former Libyan Government received a
                            U.S. letter of offer to sell eight F-5 aircraft for delivery in early
                            1971 to supplement 10 purchased in 1967. The change in government and
                            the U.S. withdrawal from Wheelus changes the original assumption of the
                            program—that working with the Libyan air force would be a useful way of
                            prolonging U.S. tenure at Wheelus. Now the new Libyan government is
                            pressing us to say whether delivery will be made.</p>
                        <p>C. European preferences. Arrangements for partial association with the
                            European Common Market have been negotiated by Morocco and Tunisia.
                            Algerian special arrangements derived from the Treaty of Rome but have
                            been cut back. All of these special arrangements entail preferences that
                            discriminate against U.S. as well as other third-country exports. The
                            U.S. has protested against these arrangements as inconsistent with the
                            GATT. <pb n="5" xml:id="d9-05" facs="d9-05"/>At the same time the U.S.
                            is interested in seeing closer North African ties with Europe evolve.
                            The question arises whether the U.S. would wish to qualify its blanket
                            opposition to preferential agreements not conforming to GATT.</p>
                        <p>D. Military assistance—Morocco and Tunisia. Current programs are running
                            at a level of $7 million in credit sales to Morocco and $3 million in
                            grants to Tunisia. The problem arises to what extent the U.S. should go
                            on providing such assistance to what may turn out to be transitory
                            regimes in the face of Congressional opposition to providing such aid to
                            developing countries-especially Arab countries.</p>
                        <p>E. Economic assistance—Morocco and Tunisia. U.S. aid is declining (1)
                            because appropriations are declining and (2) because <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has deliberately encouraged a
                            multilateral framework for aid (<gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            consultative group). Are there political reasons for trying to maintain
                            present levels?</p>
                        <p>F. The third country surrogate. The French are seeking a predominant
                            political role—for primarily French and not broad Western or U.S.
                            interests in mind. The question exists to what extent the Western
                            European presence in North Africa may compete with and not necessarily
                            complement U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>G. U.S. intervention. In view of U.S. interests in Morocco and Tunisia,
                            the question has been posed, especially by Tunisia, whether the U.S.
                            would move if Tunisia were attacked either by Algeria or Libya. While
                            avoiding a security guarantee which would be politically difficult in
                            the U.S., the U.S. in its contingency planning could decide for itself
                            how far it would be willing to go.</p>
                        <p>H. Relations with Algeria. The Hickenlooper Amendment to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act makes impossible the extension of economic assistance to
                            Algeria from public funds so long as Algeria does not take appropriate
                            steps to provide prompt <pb n="6" xml:id="d9-06" facs="d9-06"/>and
                            adequate compensation for American property it has sequestered. This
                            precludes conclusion of an investment guaranty agreement. The question
                            arises whether the Executive Branch should seek repeal of the Amendment
                            or other legislative measures that would make a guaranty possible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. POLICY ALTERNATIVES</p>
                        <p>The strategies outlined below are applied to the issues described above
                            in the table at the last page of this summary. The broad alternatives
                            are:</p>
                        <p>Alternative 1—“low political profile.” To withdraw from an active
                            official role in North Africa and to leave primary responsibility in the
                            hands of the Western Europeans.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d9-07" facs="d9-07"/>
                        <p>The arguments for this approach are consistency with the Guam doctrine
                            (in leaving to states of the area primary responsibility for their own
                            security) and facing the Europeans with assuming greater responsibility
                            for an area where their interests are in greater jeopardy than direct
                            U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>The arguments against are that this could sacrifice a U.S.
                            position—especially in Tunisia and Morocco—with no assurance that the
                            Europeans are inclined to uphold Western security interests in the area.
                            It would also have psychological repercussions on other friends
                            throughout the area if they thought the U.S. had “written off” the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Alternative 2—“selectivity” in favor of Algeria and Libya. To recognize
                            explicitly that long-term American interests in North Africa lie with
                            the militant “haves,” to adjust our policies and programs to this fact,
                            but to disengage from Morocco and Tunisia gradually.</p>
                        <p>The argument for this approach is mainly putting ourselves on what may
                            well be the wave of the future since the potential power center lies in
                            Algeria and the resource base in Algeria and Libya (including the
                            greatest U.S. investment).</p>
                        <p>The argument against is mainly that this would put us in the position of
                            walking out on two good friends, however transitional their current
                            state may be. It would seem to write them off and polarize North Africa
                            unnecessarily.</p>
                        <p>Alternative 3—“selectivity” in favor of Tunisia and Morocco. To continue
                            our present policy emphases in favor of Tunisia and Morocco but to
                            promote longer-term economic and perhaps political relationships with
                            Algeria and Libya. [This is essentially present policy.]</p>
                        <p>The argument for this approach is that it builds on present positions
                            while still leaving the door open for more effective commercial and
                            political relationships with Algeria and Libya.</p>
                        <p>The argument against is that this approach would leave us less than
                            aggressive in protecting the substantial U.S. investment in Libya and
                            backing regimes that may be destined for short life.</p>
                        <p>Alternative 4—forward strategy. To decide that U.S. interests in the
                            Mediterranean basin are important enough to require a major effort to
                            preserve the U.S. (and Western) presence in the southwestern quadrant of
                            the basin; to make an aggressive play for influence in all four North
                            African countries even at some domestic U.S. political cost.</p>
                        <p>The arguments for this approach would be essentially to demonstrate the
                            U.S. intention to stay in this area and to compete actively for
                            influence and that the U.S. does not walk out on its friends. Given
                            doubt about what the Europeans can be relied on to achieve, only U.S.
                            effort can be counted on.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d9-08" facs="d9-08"/>
                        <p>The arguments against are that this would engage the U.S. in an area that
                            is really of principal concern to Western Europe and that the U.S. does
                            not really have the resources given other higher priorities around the
                            world or the domestic political support for such a policy given the fact
                            that this would involve supporting some enemies of Israel.</p>

                        <p>The Department of State understands that no substantive action by the

                        <p>In view of the substantial amount of analysis that went into the

                            suggested that the Review Group be informed of the Inter-Departmental
                            Group's judgment that although no further action is required at this
                            time with respect to NSSM 87, the following consensus does exist at the
                            Inter-Departmental level:</p>
                        <p>“Within the limits imposed by its resources, the United States should
                            continue an active relationship with North Africa where it maintains
                            appreciable interests. These interests include Moroccan and Tunisian
                            goodwill and their general understanding of U.S. policies, access by the
                            U.S. to communications facilities at Tangier and Kenitra, the

                            investment opportunities for American firms. Because of its geographic
                            relationship to the Mediterranean, North Africa will also figure in
                            wider U.S. concerns.</p>
                        <p>“For historical and other reasons, Western European governments may also
                            be expected to be active in varying degrees in North Africa. Such
                            activity may generally be beneficial to broader Western interests in the
                            area and could coincide with those of the United States. Thus, while
                            remaining mindful of its own specific interests and concerned with their
                            protection, the U.S. should be generally receptive to Western European
                            involvement in North Africa.</p>

                                concluded that “The North Africans in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia
                                have a character and history which distinguish them from the Eastern
                                Arabs and give them somewhat different foreign policy options,
                                particularly those growing out of their closer relationship with
                                Western Europe. The North African governments are turning toward
                                Western Europe—especially France—and away from the close association
                                with either the United States or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> that characterized their policies in the 1950s and
                                1960s. US influence in North Africa will remain severely limited
                                while the US remains closely identified in Arab eyes with Israel and
                                Israel remains in occupation of Arab territory. The <gloss

                        <p>Mediterranean region is vital to Europe's interests. In fact, the
                            Mediterranean can logically be viewed as an adjunct Europe, and our
                            policies towards the region could be largely cast in terms of our
                            relations to Europe.</p>
                        <p>Yet the north and central European countries have not tended to see the
                            Mediterranean as a region whose security required their

                        <p>The picture is not quite this static, however, and there has been some

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">DeGaulle</persName> saw the Mediterranean
                            region as an important area for developing his third force concept—in a
                            sense, the fulcrum of the lever that was to stretch from Southeast Asia
                            to Latin America. He sought to circumscribe the US role and prestige and
                            reversed France's pro-Israeli policy of the 1956 war to bring it more
                            into line with the aspirations of the Arabs. Under Pompidou, the
                            Mediterranean has assumed an even more central role. The new French
                            leadership has evidently decided to husband its resources by retrenching
                            on some of DeGaulle's distant enterprises and concentrating on the
                            promising area nearer to home.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> has moved to strengthen
                            there the French position in the Mediterranean region by:</p>
                        <p>—removing political irritants and continuing investment and aid technical
                            assistance programs to reinforce the French position in the former North
                            African territories.<lb/>—trying assiduously to keep great power
                            intervention in the Arab-Israeli dispute in a four-power arrangement
                            with French participation;<lb/>—promoting arms sales (and thus
                            increasing France's influence) in Spain, Maghreb, Greece, and Iraq;<lb/>
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="d11-05" facs="d11-05"/> —taking a concerned view of
                            developments in Lebanon;<lb/>—toying with ideas for a neutralization of
                            the Mediterranean and showing increasing interest in some sort of
                            Western Mediterranean entente; <lb/>—and, most dramatically, agreeing to
                            sell Mirage aircraft to Libya as the first step in a broad program of
                            economic and military cooperation.</p>
                        <p>In sum, France has reasserted itself as a force to be reckoned with in
                            the Mediterranean region.</p>
                        <p>France's interests in the Mediterranean are not only the product of its
                            quest for grandeur. It relies on Libya and Algeria for 45 percent of its
                            oil, and Iraq contributes another 20 percent. Proceeds from sales of
                            arms contribute significantly to French foreign exchange earnings. A
                            solid position in North Africa helps ensure continued access to and
                            influence in Francophone Black Africa. An active Mediterranean policy
                            offers some hope of developing strength against a Soviet presence in the
                            Mediterranean that the French view with concern and an American presence
                            that they view with something less than enthusiasm.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d11-06" facs="d11-06"/>
                        <p>The French are aware, however, that the American presence is still
                            essential. Even in the darkest days of the Franco-US relationship,
                            DeGaulle made clear that he did not want to see the Sixth Fleet
                            withdrawn. Indeed, it is the protective umbrella of the US presence that
                            enables France to pursue its Mediterranean policy.</p>
                        <p>French hopes of offering an alternative to both the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are far from realization and their
                            prospects of becoming the premier power in the Mediterranean are
                            actually slim. The other regional states are no more enthusiastic about
                            French domination than they would be about Soviet or U.S. hegemony.
                            Particularly the former French colonies are anxious to diversify their
                            support in order to avoid the reimposition of a de facto colonial
                            situation presided over by France. The Eastern Arabs, while welcoming
                            France's attitude, know well that only the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> or the U.S. can decisively influence affairs in their
                            region.</p>
                        <p>A French role could be effective as the principal component of increased
                            European involvement in Mediterranean affairs. It is difficult to
                            envision France sharing a leadership position with others, however, and
                            the other Europeans would probably find France an extremely difficult
                            partner.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d11-07" facs="d11-07"/>
                        <p>We, too, might find France's role a difficult one. It has already been
                            unhelpful in the Arab-Israeli question, and is not likely to be amenable
                            to suggestions from us on its Mediterranean policy. On the other hand,
                            France has already played a useful role in Algeria by providing an
                            alternative to Soviet involvement, and even the Libyan aircraft sale can
                            be seen in a similar light.</p>

                                The memorandum emphasized the need to work with North African
                                nations bilaterally, as regional tensions prevented U.S.
                                policymakers from developing a comprehensive strategy for
                                approaching the region as a whole. Oil and natural gas interests in
                                the region, while significant, should not be overemphasized.
                                Finally, the current U.S. programs in North Africa were achieving
                                the appropriate results and should be continued.</note>

                        <p>Pursuant to the review of November 5, 1971, following are the conclusions
                            of our meeting with respect to U.S. policy toward North Africa for the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72 review period.</p>
                        <p>Approach - Our dealings with the North African countries must be in a
                            bilateral framework. The regional states are not closely bound together,
                            and there is no overriding external issue (East-West problems,
                            Arab-Israeli dispute) that provides scope for dealing with the region as
                            a whole.</p>
                        <p>Interests - U.S. interests in the region, while limited and not vital,
                            are significant. Our most important interests relate to oil (Libya) and
                            natural gas (Algeria) and the balance of payments benefits that we gain
                            from oil investment. Other interests are the Kenitra facility and the
                            location of Morocco at the entrance to the Mediterranean. Yet these
                            strategic considerations must be kept in proper perspective; in
                            particular, the potential threat to these interests is easily
                            overemphasized.</p>
                        <p>Threat - Our strategic concerns are protected in reasonable degree by the
                            nationalism of the states in the region, which acts as a barrier to
                            Soviet attempts to <pb n="2" xml:id="d12-02" facs="d12-02"/>install a
                            Soviet military presence or zone of Soviet influence along the southern
                            shore of the Mediterranean. The same nationalism, however, also acts
                            against our interest in maintaining special positions in the region
                            (political in Tunisia; political and military in Morocco). Over time,
                            these positions are likely to erode. The danger to our position in the
                            oil industry is more substantial. While Libyan nationalism is an
                            important threat to it, the problem must be dealt with in the overall
                            context of our global oil policy. (A special study on the international
                            oil situation is now in preparation pursuant to <gloss target="#t_PASM1"
                                >PASM</gloss> 4.) In sum, despite a fairly high level of U.S.
                            interests, we are limited in what we can do—or, fortunately, need do—to
                            protect them.</p>
                        <p>Programs - Our programs in North Africa, by and large, appear appropriate
                            to the situation at this time. (See attached Summary Sheet). Aid is
                            concentrated on Tunisia and Morocco and these two countries deserve
                            continued emphasis. (The longer term future of these bilateral aid
                            relationships is a question which we plan to look at more systematically
                            in next year's review.) Also, we should continue to keep under review
                            possible opportunities resulting from the changed situation in the
                            Sudan. We recognize that within the African framework, some shift in aid
                            allocations may be called for away from North Africa in favor of the
                            Black African countries, assuming that Congressional cuts in economic
                            aid appropriations compel us to reassess priorities. We need to keep a
                            continuing close look on military supply programs lest we become too
                            closely identified with regimes whose prospects are not too reassuring
                            (especially Morocco). Similarly, we need to keep a rein on our rhetoric
                            when talking of these regimes. Some increased emphasis on trade
                            promotion, particularly vis-a-vis Algeria, is probably warranted.
                            Current staffing patterns appear appropriate except in Libya where we
                            are in the process of phasing down and Tangier which will be closed.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d12-03" facs="d12-03"/>
                        <p>Europe and Trade Preferences - In the most important fields our interests
                            in North Africa are parallel to those of the Europeans and we welcome
                            their deep and substantial involvement in the area. (In any event there
                            is little that we could do to exclude them.) At the same time, we cannot
                            assume that the European role will always be beneficial to our own
                            interests, in particular in regard to issues in the trade and petroleum
                            areas on which we must take a stand and design policies (e.g. on aid) to
                            support these specific interests. The granting of reverse preferences is
                            such a case. Nevertheless, we should, on balance, be flexible on
                            preferences granted by the European Community to the Maghreb states. In
                            cases where we feel that we should protect these, we must have very
                            specific data on the losses that we stand to incur.</p>

                        <p>The period from April 1968 to April 1969, from the viewpoint of U.S.
                            interests and objectives in Algeria, was marked by a slight
                            preponderance of trends favorable to the U.S. On the plus side,
                            Algeria's internal political stability has improved. President <persName

                            industrial development programs, reform of the agricultural sector,
                            establishment of permanent government structures, and maximizing
                            revenues from the oil and gas industry and wine exports. Algeria has of
                            course remained vociferously anti-imperialist, a loud supporter of armed
                            struggle by the Palestinians in the Middle East, and an underwriter of
                            modest assistance for African liberation movements. However, the fact
                            remains that the lion's share of the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                            >GOA</gloss>'s money and manpower is being spent on improving the
                            domestic situation. In another significant and favorable trend, Algeria
                            has worked hard over the past few months to improve significantly
                            cooperation with its Maghreb neighbors.</p>
                        <p>On the minus side, Soviet influence over the past year has continued to
                            grow. Although the Algerians steadfastly maintain they will not grant
                            military bases to foreigners (Russians), Soviet leverage based on
                            substantial military, economic and trade programs is stronger. France
                            remains the key Western influence in Algeria, but during the past year
                            the French role continued to decline.</p>
                        <p>U.S.-Algerian relations underwent a steady improvement during the year
                            under review, although a resumption of diplomatic relations is still not
                            in sight. The Middle East and Vietnam remain major issues of <pb n="2"

                            in the private business and economic sector have experience a boom. In
                            1968, the U.S. became the number two supplier to Algeria, with estimated
                            sales of $60 million. The <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            increasingly looked to U.S. firms and technicians to help in the
                            development of the Algerian petroleum and other related industries.</p>
                        <p>Chances for renewal of diplomatic relations in 1969 are about even. The
                            initiative rightly belongs to the Algerians and we do not advocate any
                            preconditions. The evolution of the Middle East situation is probably
                            the single most important determinant. U.S. business community interests
                            in Algeria merit a shift from neutrality to a more active encouragement
                            from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. These business interests
                            form the backbone of the U.S. current presence in Algeria. Private
                            organizations (CARE, CRS, Ford Foundation, IVS, Quakers) have also made
                            an important contribution to the U.S. presence and merit continuation.
                            Resumption of any significant <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            cultural program will probably have to await diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>If the principal Western influence in Algeria—France—should lose ground
                            radically in the near future, this would create a new situation which
                            the U.S. would have to examine.</p>

                        <p>On April 7 the Revolutionary Court in Oran passed sentence on some 60
                            persons accused of conspiring against the security of the Algerian
                            state. The most prominent Algerian on trial was Belkacem Krim, historic

                            agreements with France, and since October 1967, head of the opposition

                            defendants were reportedly released. The others received punishment

                        <p>These serious allegations of U.S. involvement in internal Algerian
                            affairs come at a time when there has been a steady improvement in
                            U.S.-Algerian relations. The most recent sign came when President
                            EISENHOWER died March 28. Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Houari Boumediene</persName> sent a message of condolences to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, the first
                            communication between the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> at this level since the break of
                            relations in June 1967.</p>
                        <p>How then should the charges made at Oran be interpreted? As a new period
                            of decline in US-Algerian relations or a genuine “incident de parcours"?
                            We tend to believe that the business in Oran was an aberration and that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> still remains interested in the
                            gradual improvement of relations with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>A number of diplomatic and other sources have expressed the view that
                            publishing of Belahssen's testimony is part of Boumediene's internal
                            political balancing act, that a number of Algerians in the Party
                            elsewhere remain chronically suspicious of U.S. intentions and this was
                            the regime's way of tossing them a bone. These same sources also pointed
                            out that strong intimations of involvement by French and Egyptian secret
                            services were also voiced at the trial. Of course these accusations were
                            much less precise. The U.S. is still the easiest and biggest scapegoat
                            available to Algeria. Finally, the Oran trial served a useful domestic
                            purpose—to warn the Algerian public of the harsh punishment which the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> will mete out to anyone involved
                            in opposition activities.</p>
                        <p>For what it is worth, the Algerian press made hay of Belahssen's
                            testimony for two days after the trial ended. Then the press campaign
                            was abruptly turned off—as neatly as a water tap.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important as an indicator was the reaction of Layachi Yaker,
                            the number three Foreign Ministry official, when I called upon him to
                            express the concern and displeasure of the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_YL1">Yaker</persName> made three
                            points in reply: 1) the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> had no doubt
                            about the authenticity of the contacts by the opposition group with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and other Americans, since they
                            were supported by details of time, place, etc.; 2) that these took place
                            during the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration, a period of <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d14-03" facs="d14-03"/>special difficulty in
                            US-Algerian relations; and 3) the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>
                            nevertheless looked forward with much hope to the absence of such
                            contacts during the present American administration.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_YL1">Yaker</persName> then made a special point of
                            repeating the language which he had used during the December visit of

                        <p>* This memorandum was prepared by the Office of National Estimates. It
                            was discussed with representatives of the Office of Current Intelligence
                            and the Office of Economic Research, who are in general agreement with
                            its judgments.</p>
                        <p>Algeria has long been a paradox. It is a radical Arab state with fairly
                            close ties to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; it is also a
                            major, wealthy oil-producer, and a long time recipient of subsidies from
                            and favorable treatment by France. Its government is avowedly socialist
                            and anti-US in its public pronouncements, but it has substantial
                            dealings with American technicians and corporations. Alleged by some,
                            particularly the Moroccans, to be a pliable instrument of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Algeria in fact has occasionally
                            been critical of the Soviets and jealously guards its independence.</p>
                        <p>Algeria may continue to follow a similarly mixed pattern. Yet quite a
                            different course of developments is possible: one which would entail a
                            deterioration of its relations with France, bring on a change in its
                            dealings with the oil companies so severe as to have international
                            repercussions, and ultimately enhance its ties with the Soviet Union. We
                            do not estimate this to be the probable sequence of events; we do regard
                            it as a serious possibility worthy of careful attention.</p>

                        <p>1. Algeria became independent in 1962 after a bloody seven year rebellion
                            against the French. General De Gaulle was the sponsor and patron of the
                            settlement. He not merely agreed to the establishment of the state over
                            bitter opposition from the French military and from the politically
                            powerful French settlers in Algeria; he also provided it with the
                            financing for its early and difficult days. From 1962 to 1969, France
                            provided well over a billion dollars in economic aid and technical
                            assistance though on a declining scale. Half a million Algerians
                            continue to work in France and remit their earnings to their families at
                            home. France remains Algeria's principal trading partner. De Gaulle made
                            no special issue out of his failure to get compensation for the French
                            properties seized at independence; rather, he agreed to purchase most of
                            the wine produced by the formerly French-owned estates in Algeria,
                            though in progressively reduced quantities. In 1965, an agreement was
                            negotiated between the two governments which provided for French
                            purchase of Algerian oil at above world market prices. Since then,
                            production has substantially increased — as have revenues — and Algeria
                            has become a relatively wealthy state in the underdeveloped world.*</p>
                        <p>* Current production is nearly one million barrels a day, giving Algeria
                            an income of about $600 million in 1968.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d15-04" facs="d15-04"/>
                        <p>2. At the same time, the Algerians developed good, even close relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The most effective tie
                            has been an extensive Soviet military assistance program. Since 1963,
                            Algeria has received some $250 million in planes, tanks, ships, and the
                            like from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Its armed forces
                            are now almost ccmpletely dependent on Moscow for spare parts,
                            replacements, training, and ammunition. There are 1,200-1,500 Soviet
                            military advisors and technicians in Algeria. The Soviets are helping
                            build a large steel mill and a number of small projects. Trade is
                            growing, and substantial Soviet aid projects have been promised.
                            Recently the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed to buy the
                            large quantities of Algerian wine which France had refused to take and
                            which had been unsalable elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. Though a growing Soviet presence can be ascribed in part to arms
                            supply policy and other aid, much of it results from a considerable
                            parallelism of view and of interests between the Soviets and the
                            Algerians. Algeria is dominated, and may continue to be dominated for
                            some time, by a group of revolutionary leftists whose ideas were forged
                            during the war of independence. Though avowedly non-Marxist, far less
                            sentimentally inclined to follow Moscow's lead than was former <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d15-05" facs="d15-05"/>President BEN BELLA, and occasionally
                            in disagreement on specific programs, all want some kind of socialism
                            for Algeria.</p>
                        <p>4. In seeking to develop Algeria along non-capitalist lines, the
                            government has sought the advice of numerous foreign expert economic
                            bodies, including the Soviet's GOSPLAN. And at least some of GOSPLAN's
                            recommendations appear to have been accepted. Since then there have been
                            working ties between Russian and Algerian planners, technicians,
                            engineers and the like, paralleling the working relationships between
                            their military counterparts. The Algerians are seeking to develop as
                            much autarchy as possible by establishing a host of import substitution
                            enterprises. Aided by some 2,000 Soviets, and by even more Frenchmen,
                            Germans, Americans, and other Westerners, Algeria is now embarked on a
                            major economic development program. Most investment is in costly
                            projects designed to make Algeria, ultimately, a sizeable industrial
                            power with jobs and prosperity for all. But many years will be required
                            to produce results. In the interim, as in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, the consumer comes last; living standards are low,
                            taxes high, and goods scarce. There is also widespread unemployment.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d15-06" facs="d15-06"/>
                        <p>5. This development program is far from being Russian directed or
                            administered however. Indeed, one of the Algerian government's principal
                            aims is to acquire or maintain its own control of all elements of the
                            economy, including those in which the Soviets are participating. To this
                            end, it has nationalized or taken over the direction of virtually all
                            foreign private enterprises in Algeria, except for foreign, principally
                            French, oil companies. At the same time, it is launching a host of new
                            joint ventures with Western, including many American, private
                            corporations in such fields as oil exploration. It is also directly
                            hiring the services of American consultants — e.g., Arthur D. Little,
                            Inc. — and is seeking American equipment and expertise for such items as
                            computer systems and even whole factories.</p>
                        <p>6. Further, the Algerian government-owned oil and gas company, SONATRACH,
                            is seeking to sell its products directly to foreign countries. A
                            recently signed contract with the EL PASO Natural Gas Company is its
                            most notable success so far. If the financing of this project goes
                            through, an investment of over $900 million ($300 million by EL PASO,
                            $600 million by the Algerians) will be made and SONATRACH will sell
                            large <pb n="7" xml:id="d15-07" facs="d15-07"/>quantities of liquified
                            natural gas (about 14 percent of present US consumption) to EL PASO for
                            American use.</p>
                        <p>7. A common thread runs through all this activity. In each case the
                            Algerian government refuses to surrender control of any project to an
                            outsider. Unlike the traditional oil concessions of the Middle East over
                            the years, which grant outside companies considerable latitude in
                            determining such matters as exploration and production, all Algerian
                            joint venture agreements give the host government 51 percent of the
                            shares — and operating control. The highly paid foreign consultants and
                            technicians are employees of the Algerian government, which can hire and
                            fire them at will. The expensive expertise and equipment being purchased
                            is paid for by Algeria's oil revenues, and this gives it substantial
                            freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>8. Algeria's foreign policies are not unlike its domestic ones. It seeks
                            to maintain freedom from outside domination and direction, while
                            pursuing courses of action and adopting attitudes consistent with its
                            own revolutionary principles. It normally sympathizes with the socialist
                            world rather than the capitalist one. It views the US government with
                            suspicion <pb n="8" xml:id="d15-08" facs="d15-08"/>and frequently with
                            hostility. It particularly objects to US policy in Vietnam and in the
                            Middle East; it regards the efforts of the Viet Cong and the
                            Palestinians as counterparts of its own revolutionary struggle, and
                            casts the US in the role of the French in that conflict.</p>
                        <p>9. Soviet-Algerian relations, on the other hand, are generally good.
                            Russian naval craft can call at Algerian ports, but do so very
                            infrequently. The state controlled press printed only the Tass version
                            of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Soviets, for their part,
                            frequently praise Algeria as a progressive Arab state developing in a
                            correct manner. But even with extensive arms supply programs and many
                            ideological affinities, Soviet influence remains limited. Many more
                            Westerners than Russians are engaged in Algerian development efforts,
                            and there are no signs of change in this respect. The two countries
                            openly disagree on some issues, notably on the Arab-Israeli conflict;
                            the Algerians ridicule Soviet efforts to achieve a peaceful solution,
                            saying that the only acceptable course of action there is for the
                            Palestinians to emulate Algeria's independence struggle.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d15-09" facs="d15-09"/>
                        <p>10. This and other differences may lead to private debates between
                            Algerian and Soviet officials, but to only a few open signs of acrimony;
                            they are being treated on both sides as something to agree to disagree
                            about. All in all, an appraisal of the degree of Soviet influence on the
                            Algerian government eventually becomes an exercise in semantics. The
                            counsels of the Russian Ambassador no doubt carry weight, but are not
                            decisive. Soviet-Algerian relations remain excellent because both
                            parties enjoy mutual advantages from them. The question then arises:
                            could the balance be tipped so that Algeria would some day no longer be
                            in its present strong position to reject Moscow's “advice” on important
                            issues? In this connection, much will depend on Algeria's future
                            relationships with two other major outside forces it deals with: France
                            and the oil industry.</p>
                        <p>11. The Algerian leaders must be concerned that Pompidou will not show
                            them his predecessor's forbearance and sympathy. Indeed, even before de
                            Gaulle stepped down, strains had appeared between Paris and Algiers. In
                            1968, under heavy pressure from French growers, Paris ended the purchase
                            of all but small amounts of Algerian wine. In the same year, Algerian
                                <pb n="10" xml:id="d15-10" facs="d15-10"/>immigration into France
                            was all but cut off for a time, though this restriction was eventually
                            eased by De Gaulle.</p>
                        <p>12. More serious to the Algerians is what they see as the unfriendly
                            policy of the French oil companies, who produce over 80 percent of total
                            Algerian output. Algiers charges that these companies are not exploiting
                            their fields to the fullest; further, it claims that in failing to
                            explore for further oil reserves, the French are not living up to their
                            obligations. The companies counter that virtually all of Algeria's oil
                            reserves have been located, that reserves are being depleted so rapidly
                            that overall output will sharply decline over the next few years. (1)
                            These disputes have led to acrimonious Algerian press attacks, to the
                            nationalization (so far without compensation) of virtually all remaining
                            non-petroleum French private businesses in 1968, and even to Algerian
                            participation in the assault on the franc in November of that year. (2)
                            De Gaulle took such harassments with forbearance; <persName

                        <p>(1) [text not declassified] He believes that output five years from now
                            may be only 60 percent of its present rate unless new fields are
                            discovered. He is not optimistic that they will be.</p>
                        <p>(2) During that monetary crisis Algeria took 500 million francs ($100
                            million) from its reserves and purchased gold or dollars.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d15-11" facs="d15-11"/>
                        <p>13. For their part, Algerians may be getting ready to make some new and
                            possibly severe moves against the oil companies, which are the principal
                            remaining French assets in Algiers. At least the French are concerned
                            about such a possibility. The opportunity to do so is not too far away;
                            the Franco-Algerian oil accords must be renegotiated between the two
                            governments in late 1970 if either party requests it.</p>
                        <p>14. Past Algerian treatment of, and demands on US oil companies, which
                            produce about 10 percent of Algeria's oil and whose assets in the
                            country run to some $100 million, may indicate what the French could
                            face. If so, the latter are in for a bad time; the American companies
                            have been treated with a harshness unmatched in the Middle East.
                            Algerian managers were installed by the government during the
                            Arab-Israeli 1967 war, though Americans continue to operate the
                            companies. Further, the companies are forbidden to expatriate any of
                            their earnings. Then in 1969, one of the US firms (Sinclair) was, on a
                            legal pretext, nationalized. Over the years, American oil men have
                            reported harassment and a stubborn unwillingness to compromise on the
                            part of the Algerians.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d15-12" facs="d15-12"/>
                        <p>15. They also report a continuing effort by the Algerians to get them to
                            accept what eventually came to be known as the “Getty formula”.
                            According to the latter, a new joint venture would be formed, with the
                            Algerians, as in their dealings with non-oil companies, holding 51
                            percent of the shares. In addition to becoming a minority stockholder,
                            the oil company has initially to invest large sums and gets only 12
                            percent of the profits. This formula is unprecedently favorable to the
                            host government and goes far beyond other petroleum arrangements in the
                            Middle East or elsewhere. It has been pressed by the Algerians at every
                            opportunity (they offered to de-nationalize Sinclair, return its
                            holdings, and free it of many restrictions if it would sign such an
                            agreement). But for a long time no company in Algeria would agree,
                            fearing the precedent that would be set elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>16. Finally, however, Mr. J. Paul Getty signed on Algeria's terms. He was
                            greeted with effusive publicity, his cooperation was warmly welcomed,
                            and he was given the country's most promising areas for exploration.*
                            The French companies now fear that the <pb n="13" xml:id="d15-13"
                                facs="d15-13"/>Algerians will insist on similar concessions from
                            them in the 1970 negotiations. They are also concerned that they will
                            receive the same treatment meted out to the Americans — harassment,
                            freezing of assets, and even nationalization — if they refuse to meet
                            such demands.</p>
                        <p>* In eight months of operations, the Getty Company's experience tends to
                            confirm the French thesis that Algerian reserves have been pretty well
                            discovered. Only dry holes have been drilled.</p>
                        <p>17. Each side can approach the 1970 petroleum negotiations with weapons
                            of its own. On the one hand, the French government may feel it could
                            make Algeria suffer if drastic moves were to be taken against French
                            assets. France might be able, with the assistance of the other major oil
                            companies, to block the sales of Algeria's petroleum and gas, which
                            account for 70 percent of its export revenues, in most parts of the
                            non-Communist world. A cutoff of Algerian petroleum would create no
                            actual shortages in France, as there are ample supplies in other parts
                            of Africa, the Persian Gulf and the Western Hemisphere. Beyond this, the
                            French could refuse to import citrus fruit, minerals and other items
                            from Algeria which remain important sources of income. Pompidou, who
                            would probably be less inhibited than De Gaulle, might even block
                            remittances from Algerians in France to their families at home or, in
                            extremis, expel those workers.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d15-14" facs="d15-14"/>
                        <p>18. Such French retaliations would be strongly supported by the major oil
                            companies, including the American ones; acceptance of such extreme
                            Algerian demands would have a major impact on the world oil industry, in
                            which US firms play the principal role and which provides a very
                            important support to the US balance of payments. As in the past, other
                            governments, e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, would probably start
                            pushing hard for equal treatment. In these circumstances, most oil
                            companies would probably exert heavy pressures on the French oil
                            companies, and on the French and US governments to resist Algerian
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>19. The government in Algiers might be vulnerable to such punitive
                            measures. The political climate remains uncertain. In the past two
                            years, President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> had to
                            put down an attempted coup, and narrowly escaped being assassinated.
                            There are opponents of the regime both inside and outside the country
                            and a successful conspiracy might take place in agitated times. The
                            regime's economic approach, which in fact amounts to grinding down the
                            present generation so the next will enjoy high living standards, is
                            probably becoming less and less palatable to the Algerian people. They
                            have remained docile and most of them <pb n="15" xml:id="d15-15"
                                facs="d15-15"/>apolitical; one of the major reasons for this is the
                            war weariness and apathy engendered by the brutal independence struggle.
                            But that was seven years ago, and another generation is on the way.
                            Indeed, there are some strong reasons for the Algerians to keep on good
                            terms with the French. However intense their revolutionary dogmas, they
                            need the money the French oil companies pay to support their ambitious
                            and expensive development program.</p>
                        <p>20. In these circumstances we might expect that a new Franco-Algerian
                            accord will be forthcoming in 1970 if indeed negotiations take place.
                            The Algerian government now receives some $600-700 million a year in oil
                            and gas revenues; it needs this money for its high priority development
                            program, that much or most of this income could dry up in the event of a
                            crisis. If the two parties behaved rationally, they should arrive at a
                            mutually acceptable accommodation.</p>
                        <p>21. This may indeed happen, but an opposite case can be made. “Rational”
                            can be a misleading term, particularly when concepts of socialism and
                            national pride are involved and when there is ample room for error in
                            calculations of <pb n="16" xml:id="d15-16" facs="d15-16"/>bargaining
                            strength. If Algeria decides it must have maximum oil revenues with a
                            minimum of French retaliatory acts, it would almost certainly not
                            generate a crisis. However, it may decide that other goals are
                            paramount.</p>
                        <p>22. There is little doubt that the Algerians would like to fully control
                            all the resources within their territory, and the French oil companies
                            are the only ones of any importance they do not now control. In this
                            respect, Algeria's leaders differ fundamentally from the monarchs of
                            Saudi Arabia or Libya, who feel quite comfortable working with foreign
                            companies on a concession basis. The important question is, do the
                            Algerians think they can getaway with threatening or actually seizing
                            the French companies?</p>
                        <p>23. The Algerians almost certainly recognize that they have some
                            effective means of putting pressure on the French. They see Paris facing
                            a balance of payments crisis. In the past year, they have noted France
                            drawing down half its foreign exchange reserves and devaluating the
                            franc so as to increase export earnings and decrease import costs. The
                            Algerians could, if they wished,</p>
                        <p>further aggravate Paris' balance of payments <pb n="17" xml:id="d15-17"
                                facs="d15-17"/>problems. Thus in 1970 French oil companies in
                            Algeria will expect to repatriate up to $400 million in earnings to the
                            metropole. Even the threat of an Algerian freeze of these funds would
                            have serious repercussions. In such circumstances the Algerians might
                            reason that the French government could be induced to accept something
                            like the Getty formula, rather than lose everything.</p>
                        <p>24. Beyond this, the Algerians may calculate that they would not suffer
                            all that much if they moved against the French oil companies. Algerian
                            petroleum comes from west of the Suez Canal and is low in sulphur
                            content — both highly desirable attributes in Western Europe these days.
                            The Algerians may feel they could sell to independent companies in
                            Germany, Italy and elsewhere in</p>
                        <p>Western Europe — without having to share the earnings with the French.
                            They may be right (their nationalization of Sinclair has not hurt them);
                            at present, nobody knows how successful such efforts would be,
                            particularly over a fairly extended period of time. And the Algerians
                            could plan for a fairly extended time of crisis; they have some $600
                            million in foreign exchange reserves. In any event, the country's
                            leaders have long been accustomed to adopting policies entailing high
                            risks and imposing personal hardships on the Algerian people.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="d15-18" facs="d15-18"/>
                        <p>25. They may also feel that the Soviets would, if the worst happens, come
                            to their assistance. Though the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            a net exporter of oil, it is already purchasing small amounts from
                            Algeria and might for political reasons, and perhaps for economic ones
                            as well, agree to take substantially more. Armaments aside, the
                            Algerians generally prefer Western industrial equipment to that of
                            Soviet manufacture. But if there were no alternative, they would
                            probably accept the latter in payment for their oil. How far the Soviets
                            would be willing or able to come to the aid of their friends is open to
                            question. But in the event of a rupture in French-Algerian relations,
                            they might take the opportunity to enhance their influence in
                            Algeria.</p>

                        <p>1. Following memcon Secretary's meeting with <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> New York October 10 is uncleared, subject
                            revision upon review, <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> NOFORN.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary said he gathered relations had been improving for last year
                            or two; that this was good trend which we would like to see continued.
                            Asked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s views. <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> thanked Secretary for providing
                            opportunity to meet. Said that US-Algerian relations had improved since
                            1967 break; that it not correct call it break, would be more correct to
                            call change “slow-down.” In fact, it seemed that US-Algerian relations
                            had never been better than during “slow-down.” Cultural and</p>
                        <p>economic fields in recent past had been quite positive, notwithstanding
                            day-to-day contingencies <pb n="2" xml:id="d16-02" facs="d16-02"/>and
                            fluctuations of the international scene. He believed we were meeting
                            requirements for quite positive relationship.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> indicated that Algerian
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should not preclude
                            improvement in its relations with US, particularly in economic field.
                            Our relations should develop on same lines as with <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and France. What had opposed
                            development of relations were political problems of an external
                            character.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> felt that two countries
                            should be careful not to engage in changes that might prove “traumatic”
                            and leave sequels in future. Relations in economic field were improving
                            dramatically, particularly in field of hydrocarbons. He believed that
                            Sinclair, one of major oil firms with investments in Algeria, would be
                            acting in its own best interests if it did not create a situation that
                            would be useless and lead nowhere, because there certainly possibilities
                            of settling such disputes through friendly compromise. This <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d16-03" facs="d16-03"/>was all more important as there were
                            no opposing interests between US oil corporations and Algeria; whereas
                            in case of French investments, very nature and size of holdings are a
                            problem. Compromise settlements with US would be useful in their
                            negotiations with French. It was Algeria's purpose to reduce the
                            “immense” French investments to manageable size.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> reiterated his country not
                            preserve of one or another great power, that it does not entertain
                            privileged relations with one great power or another but wanted
                            relations with all major powers.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then summarized his
                            presentation. Algeria was now working to consolidate its relations in
                            all fields and to achieve normalization in all aspects of its economic
                            development through its own efforts and through cooperation with others,
                            in the hope that its relations with US will enter a new era known in
                            past.</p>
                        <p>7. Secretary asked whether he had any specific ideas on <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d16-04" facs="d16-04"/>improving relations. <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he recognize that efforts of
                            cooperation are closely tied with political conditions. He said he was
                            now sure beyond a doubt that US was no longer interested in Vietnam as
                            such and that it wished to settle question and establish peace. Algeria
                            would always support any actions US took toward peace. In Middle East a
                            positive US gesture would make a great impact on Algerians. He saw no
                            essential impediments to improvements.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary thanked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> for his
                            presentation. He said we would consider seriously the question of
                            improving relations and expressed pleasure that relations had improved
                            some between the two countries in last few years. He agreed Algeria was
                            sometimes a “difficult partner” and said that he understood. He noted US
                            public and Congress generally felt that Algeria was an aligned country,
                            because it so often, almost without exception, was aligned against US
                            positions. It was hard to convince them that we received the same <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d16-05" facs="d16-05"/>treatment as <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We hoped these obstacles could be
                            overcome in future because we had no interests in conflict. Secretary
                            said US Congress and public opinion did not expect Algeria to be aligned
                            with US, but they certainly did not want Algeria always aligned against
                            US. If they were always against us it would be hard to convince people
                            Algeria was unaligned. Secretary concluded, however, that US would like
                            to improve relations, and we would meet them half way.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> responded that perhaps it
                            would be possible for him to consider designating someone in his
                            Department to be in direct contact with the US Charge in Algeria and
                            vice versa in Washington. Secretary said he thought that was good idea,
                            that we would designate someone promptly.</p>

                        <p>Messers. Pedersen and <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> met
                            with Ambassador Yazid, at his suggestion on instructions from the
                            Foreign Minister, to continue the discussion opened between the
                            Secretary and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> on October 10.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the previous notification that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> had been designated the point
                            of contact for the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> in the
                            Department, Yazid said that the contact in the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss> Foreign Ministry would be designated following the
                            conference of Algerian chiefs of mission now taking place in Algiers.
                            Mr. Pedersen said that in making their decision they should know that,
                            depending on the rank of the Algerian designated, we would be prepared
                            to consider the contact on our side at the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            level. (Yazid made no comment on this.)</p>
                        <p>Yazid noted that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> intended to
                            raise the level of its representation in Washington. He said the
                            decision as to who might head the Algerian Interests Section was not yet
                            taken. In response to <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName>'s
                            question, Yazid said that if the person were not Counselor <persName

                        <p>Mr. Pedersen said that he had heard that Yazid had made a tough speech

                            understanding of our objective. Mr. Pedersen pointed out that sharp
                            rhetoric on Algeria's side would not make the resolution of our
                            bilateral problems any easier.</p>
                        <p>Yazid then said that there appeared to be three impediments in
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> relations:</p>
                        <p>(1) The first, as his Foreign Minister had said, was Viet Nam. Yazid
                            expressed the view that this problem appeared to be “fading away”. He
                            hoped that with increased confidence between Algeria and the U.S.,
                            public and private positions could be as close as possible.</p>
                        <p>(2) The second problem, he thought, had been Algeria's role in the
                            Maghreb. From his experience in the U.S. he felt that this would be the
                            most important factor in U.S. public opinion. Yazid went into some
                            detail in describing Algerian efforts to achieve an overall detente in
                            the Maghreb. He indicated that now that Algeria's domestic house was in
                            better order President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>
                            felt freer to play an active and constructive role in the Maghreb. He
                            cited the detente between Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia; the
                            Morocco-Mauritania rapprochement; and the defusing of Spanish Sahara as
                            a political issue in North West Africa. He said he hoped that Algeria
                            could be of assistance to the young Libyan government and cited a long,
                            but rather vague, history of <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>-Libyan
                            cooperation. The point was that Algeria was behaving responsibly in
                            North Africa.</p>
                        <p>(3) The third problem, Yazid said, related to the Middle East. Algeria
                            was less concerned with the state of relations among the “major powers”
                            than it was about the rights and security of the “little people” in the
                            Middle East. Specifically, and in the light of Algeria's own recent
                            history, the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was concerned about the
                            right of Palestinians to live in peace and security. The issue of
                            Palestine, as such, should not be overlooked in an eventual settlement.
                            Would it be impossible for the U.S. to be more “even-handed” in dealing
                            with the issue of Palestine and the Palestinians? Yazid's pitch was not
                            (as Raschid Zeghar's had been in earlier conversations in Washington)
                            for any form of support for Al Fatah or the guerrillas. Pedersen said he
                            thought differences of opinion would undoubtedly continue on this issue,
                            as we felt the main objective had to be establishment of peace in <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d17-03" facs="d17-03"/>the Middle East for all states
                            in the Middle East area. He inquired whether Algeria would interfere if
                            the UAR or Jordan wished to negotiate a peace. Yazid said not if it
                            affected their own soverign concerns; if they sought to abandon the
                            rights of the Palestinians Algeria would come to their support.</p>
                        <p>Yazid reiterated what <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName>
                            had told the Secretary: that relations between Algeria and the U.S. had
                            never been better than they had been since 1967. He alluded to the
                            rapidly increasing array of mutual economic interests, adding that these
                            were giving the Algerians “options” in their attempts to reduce their
                            dependence on both France and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            manageable proportions.</p>
                        <p>Against this backdrop, Yazid said, he knew we had been troubled by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>'s nationalization of a small
                            American-owned bus company (five buses) in 1963 and by the fact that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> had taken over a house and land
                            in Algeria belonging to an American. Algeria had been unable to
                            compensate for these steps because it would have involved them in heavy
                            compensation for French owned properties.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Secretary's inquiry about concrete steps that might be
                            taken to improve relations, Yazid noted a number of financial and other
                            steps were still required in connection with the El Paso agreement and
                            other pending matters. Investment guarantees would be useful in
                            persuading financial interests to put up the capital Algeria would
                            require as a result of the El Paso-SONATRACH agreement. Perhaps the
                            guarantees would also make it easier for the EXIM Bank to finance the
                            sale of Boeings to Air Algerie. Yazid said he had also heard that some
                            of El Paso's competitors were unhappy thatalternative sources of natural
                            gas would be entering East Coast markets. He assumed these corporations
                            would be making their case before the Federal Power Commission, and the
                            attitude of the State Department might be significant. Yazid hoped the
                            Department of State might use its good offices to help the Algerians
                            along. He said that the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> would be
                            willing to talk to us about an investment guarantee agreement that would
                            be in harmony with Algerian laws.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pedersen said that we would consider this and give them a reply
                            shortly, but pointed out that the conclusion of such an agreement would
                            be prevented by our laws in the absence of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that he had been
                            pleased to hear that the Algerians considered good progress to have been
                            made on the first <pb n="4" xml:id="d17-04" facs="d17-04"/>two numbered
                            points above. He had also been impressed by Yazid's description of the
                            “options” the U.S. had provided Algeria in its dealings with France and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> pointed out that these
                            “options” all appeared to have benefited Algeria more than the U.S.; he
                            could think of no comparable options that had become available to the
                            U.S. in its dealings with Algeria in the past two years. This was a
                            point the Algerians might keep in mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pedersen added that insofar as the <gloss target="#t_FPC1"
                                >FPC</gloss> was concerned, it would be interested in assurances as
                            to the long-range reliability of supplies of natural gas from Algeria.
                            Here again the status of relations between Algeria and the U.S. would be
                            an important factor.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that in his opinion
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> faced two problems:</p>
                        <p>(1)The first was its image in the U.S. At the moment, the image was not
                            good. Mr. Pedersen added that many Americans thought that Algeria was
                            too frequently on the same side of issues as the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, for example. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCWIII1">Bray</persName> said that we were glad that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> was upgrading its representation
                            in Washington and hoped that the head of the interests section would be
                            assisted by able officers.</p>
                        <p>(2) There had been progress on Vietnam and in the Maghreb. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> should weigh in its own mind, whether -
                            in the context of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> mutual
                            interests - the issue of “Palestine for the Palestinians” outweighed
                            other considerations of importance to the <gloss target="#t_GOA1"
                                >GOA</gloss>, e.g. access to American capital markets, etc. The
                            decision was one for the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> to make; we
                            hoped that it was clear, however, that our door was open at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Yazid acknowledged the image problem and said that he would be coming to
                            Washington in the near future to consult with Congress and the Executive
                            Branch “as other lobbyists do”. He reiterated that our position on
                            Palestine was important to the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> since
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> could identify with guerrilla
                            activities in the light of its own history. (He added that the Fedayeen
                            were the only eastern Arabs who need feel no sense of humiliation, since
                            they are still fighting.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pedersen asked whether Yazid had other concrete steps to suggest.
                            Yazid answered that he was expecting a high level economist to come from
                            Algeria in the near future. He would like to bring him to Washington for
                            discussions. Messers. Pedersen and <persName corresp="#p_BCWIII1"
                                >Bray</persName> assured him that all useful doors would be
                            open.</p>
                        <p>Yazid said that he would be in touch to continue the dialogue, most
                            probably in Washington</p>

                            to inaugurate a new foreign policy asserting the priority of internal
                            over external affairs. Algeria would shun the example of those
                            “progressive” regimes that had played a “vanguard” role on the
                            international scene only to collapse for internal reasons.</p>
                        <p>Algeria's foreign policy priorities would henceforth be in this order:
                            “material, political, and ideological”. The main emphasis would be on
                            setting Algeria's economic and financial house in order, and the
                            performance of ambassadors' would be rated accordingly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> said that Algerian
                            foreign policy would also be based on a number of key principles: (1)
                            independence of all foreign powers, whatever their position; (2)
                            stability, peace and non-interference in the Maghreb; (3) mutual
                            “cooperation” rather than “alms”; (4) an abhorrence of blocs, military
                            bases, and special preserves; (5) in the Middle East an “escalation of
                            armed struggle” by the Palestinians themselves - which he stated
                            somewhat defensively was not an “extremist” position but simply an
                            extension of Algeria's own independence creed; and (6) continued support
                            to Vietnam and the African liberation movements.</p>

                        <p>What stands out in this speech is the emphasis on <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>'s personal philosophy of
                            concentration on internal goals. The theme had figured in earlier
                            Bournediene speeches but had never been fully woven into Algerian
                            foreign policy. Until the past year <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>'s attention had been preoccupied with
                            internal problems. With these now in hand, he is free to turn more to
                            foreign affairs and to lean more in that field on his own ideas.</p>
                        <p>This is an attractive refrain, since the assertion of economic interests
                            can be used to justify a bettering of relations with the U.S. In any
                            event, the downgrading of political and ideological concerns may signal
                            the emergence of a more pragmatic, technocratically-oriented
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Nowhere in the October 21 speech was the U.S. attacked. The old
                            self-image of a beleaguered socialist Algeria “surrounded” by hostile
                            pro-Western states appears to have disappeared. Even the sharper
                            passages in the speech relating to the Middle East seemed designed
                            mainly to demonstrate that Algeria had not renounced its revolutionary
                            heritage.</p>
                        <p>But it was probably too much to expect that Algeria would completely
                            forsake its old ways. On October 22, <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> - perhaps reacting to criticisms of his
                            previous mildness - corrected the record on the U.S. with respect both
                            to Vietnam and the Middle East. He explained that Algeria's criticism of
                            the U.S. had nothing to do with purely national interests but was
                            directed to the international role of the U.S., which he described as
                            “hostile” to just causes. In private, the Algerians now tend to tone
                            down this kind of language, but not yet, it appears, for general
                            consumption.</p>

                            RELATIONS AT THIS TIME, HE WISHES TO BUILD UP U.S.-ALGERIAN ECONOMIC

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> BEGAN BY DISCUSSING
                            U.S.-ALGERIAN DIPLOMATIC BREAK IN 1967 IN MANNER WHICH AMOUNTED TO
                            ADMISSION THAT IT HAD BEEN A STUPID MISTAKE BUT THAT RENEWAL WITHOUT
                            SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT TO JUSTIFY IT WOULD ONLY CONFIRM ORIGINAL
                            ALGERIAN FOLLY. HE REFERRED TO VIET NAM WHERE U.S. HAD TAKEN POSITIVE
                            STEP BY ENGAGING IN PARIS MEETINGS BUT WHERE NO AGREEMENT HAD YET BEEN
                            REACHED. ON MIDDLE EAST U.S. POLICY APPEARED TO BE CONSTANTLY CHANGING
                            WITH REPORTS FAVORABLE TO ARABS ONE DAY AND PRO-ISRAELI NEXT. HE IMPLIED
                            THAT NEITHER VIET NAM NOR MIDDLE EAST HAD YET PROVIDED PEG ON WHICH
                            ALGERIA COULD RENEW DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> THEN TURNED TO ECONOMIC
                            RELATIONS WHICH HAD IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING LAST TWO YEARS SO THAT
                            U.S. FIRMS NOW ENJOYED A “FAVORED POSITION” HERE. ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT
                            WISHED THIS TREND TO CONTINUE SO THAT WHEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE
                            FINALLY RESTORED THEY WOULD BE BASED ON SOMETHING TANGIBLE AND ENDURING.
                            MOST IMPORTANT FIELD OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR FUTURE WAS IN LIQUEFIED
                            GAS PROJECTS, SUCH AS EL PASO DEAL. HE HAD HAD LONG TALK WITH EL PASO
                            PRESIDENT BOYD WHO WAS IN ALGIERS RECENTLY AND HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY
                            FACT THAT ORIGINAL PROJECT CALLING FOR DELIVERY 10 BILLION CUBIC METERS
                            PER YEAR AMOUNTED TO ONLY 2 PERCENT OF TOTAL U.S. CONSUMPTION. BOYD HAD
                            TOLD HIM THAT PROSPECTS WERE GOOD THAT SALES COULD BE EXTENDED AN
                            ADDITIONAL 5 BILLION CUBIC METERS PER YEAR.</p>
                        <p>5. REFERRED TO TWO ASPECTS OF EL PASO DEAL WHICH INVOLVED <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. FIRST WAS APPROVAL OF PROJECT BY FPC.
                            SECOND, WHICH WAS MAIN PURPOSE OF HIS CALLING ME IN, WAS FINANCING OF
                            ALGERIA'S SHARE OF PROJECT. DURING HIS MEETING WITH SECRETARY ROGERS IN
                            OCTOBER SECRETARY HAD “PROMISED TO BE HELPFUL IN SUCH MATTERS”. HE NOTED
                            THAT SECRETARY WAS EX-OFFICIO MEMBER OF BOARD OF EXIMBANK. HE THOUGHT
                            THAT BANK COULD PLAY MAJOR ROLE IN ARRANGING FINANCING OF EL PASO
                            PROJECT AND WISHED ME TO CONVEY TO DEPARTMENT AND SECRETARY HIS REQUEST
                            FOR THEIR SUPPORT. HE ALSO WONDERED WHETHER THE IBRD MIGHT BE HELPFUL,
                            THOUGH HE WAS CENTERING HIS REQUEST ON EXIMBANK.</p>
                        <p>6. IN REPLY I RECIPROCATED <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss>'S
                            DESIRE TO BUILD ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND NOTED THAT STATE DEPARTMENT WAS
                            TAKING POSITIVE <pb n="3" xml:id="d19-03" facs="d19-03"/>POSITION IN
                            THIS REGARD. FOR EXAMPLE EXIMBANK LOAN OBTAINED FOR ALGERIA'S PURCHASE
                            OF BOEINGS. I ALSO REFERRED TO QUESTION OF FPC APPROVAL AND SAID WE WERE
                            ON WHOLE OPTIMISTIC, BUT PROCESS MIGHT TAKE LONG TIME. I UNDERTOOK TO
                            TRANSMIT FONMIN'S REQUEST TO DEPARTMENT AND SECRETARY AND SAID I WOULD
                            ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITY IN KINSHASA TO SEE NOT ONLY SECRETARY BUT
                            ASSISTANT SECRETARY NEWSOM AND COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR NORTH AFRICA BLAKE
                            AND OTHERS WHO WERE INTERESTED IN ALGERIA.</p>
                        <p>7. I OBSERVED THAT PRINCIPLE THAT ALGERIA COULD USE EXIM FACILITY
                            APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, BUT FINANCING OF EL PASO DEAL WAS
                            LARGE AND COMPLEX MATTER REQUIRING A NUMBER OF SOURCES MANY OF WHICH
                            WOULD BE PRIVATE. I REFERRED TO WIDESPREAD IMPRESSION THAT ALGERIAN
                            GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED IBRD HOSTILE. WE BELIEVED THIS WAS A MISTAKE SINCE
                            WE UNDERSTOOD THAT DOORS AT IBRD WERE OPEN TO AN ALGERIAN APPROACH. WE
                            HAD BEEN SURPRISED AT RECENT ATTACK ON IBRD AND ROBERT MCNAMARA IN
                            RECENT ISSUE OF QUASI-OFFICIAL ALGERIAN NEWSPAPER.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> REPLIED THAT IT WAS TRUE
                            THAT ALGERIA FELT THAT IBRD WAS HOSTILE. HE WAS VERY INTERESTED,
                            HOWEVER, IN MY STATEMENT THAT WE THOUGHT A DIALOGUE WITH BANK COULD BE
                            USEFUL. HE SAID ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT HAD HIGHEST REGARD FOR MR. MCNAMARA,
                            AND GAVE IMPRESSION THEY MIGHT TAKE INITIATIVE IN APPROACHING IBRD.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> SAID HE WAS GLAD TO KNOW
                            THAT I WOULD BE SENDING REPORT OF OUR CONVERSATION TO WASHINGTON BY
                            TELEGRAM. ALGERIA WAS IN A HURRY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND WAS
                            ANXIOUS TO HAVE A REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HE WONDERED WHETHER I COULD
                            GO TO RABAT DURING SECRETARY'S VISIT THERE TO DISCUSS MATTER WITH HIM. I
                            OBSERVED THAT SECRETARY'S SCHEDULE IS TIGHT, THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
                            FOR HIM TO RECEIVE CHIEFS OF MISSION WHO MIGHT WANT TO INTERCEPT HIM
                            ALONG PATH OF HIS AFRICAN TRIP AND IN ANY CASE I COULD DISCUSS MATTER IN
                            KINSHASA.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FONMIN</gloss> SAID <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> WOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
                            WHETHER OR NOT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COULD ARRANGE
                            FINANCING OF EL PASO DEAL. I REPLIED THAT QUESTION OF FINANCING WAS
                            EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND AGAIN MENTIONED FACT THAT EXIMBANK WAS ONLY
                            ONE POSSIBLE ELEMENT <pb n="4" xml:id="d19-04" facs="d19-04"/>IN A
                            FINANCIAL PACKAGE. QUESTION WAS NOT WHETHER <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> COULD PROVIDE FINANCING BUT EXTENT TO WHICH DEPARTMENT
                            COULD BE HELPFUL IN FACILITATING ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO FIND FINANCING.
                            THUS IT WAS NOT QUESTION OF A YES OR NO REPLY. I HOPED, HOWEVER, THAT I
                            WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM DEPARTMENT'S AND SECRETARY'S VIEWS WHICH COULD
                            HELP ALGERIA MOVE PROJECT FORWARD.</p>
                        <p>11. SINCE BOUTEFLIKA SEEMED INCLINED TO CONTINUE CONVERSATION I REFERRED
                            TO HIS STATEMENT ABOUT CHANGES IN U.S. POLICY IN MIDDLE EAST. HE SAID
                            THAT HE AND OTHERS IN ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FAVORABLY IMPRESSED
                            BY SECRETARY'S SPEECH <pb n="5" xml:id="d19-05" facs="d19-05"/>OF
                            DECEMBER 9. HE ALSO APPRECIATED VERY MUCH OUR HAVING MADE AVAILABLE TO
                            HIM ON CONFIDENTIAL BASIS DOCUMENTS OUTLINING AMERICAN POSITION. HE HAD
                            PERSONALLY SUGGESTED THAT SMAIL HAMDANI ACT AS SPECIAL LIAISON ON SUCH
                            MATTERS SINCE HAMDANI HAD CLOSE CONTACTS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH
                            PRESIDENT BOUMEDIENE. RE MIDDLE EAST, HE HAD IMPRESSION U.S. POSITION
                            HAD SLIPPED SINCE ARAB SUMMIT MEETING. I REPLIED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE
                            CASE AND CONVERSATION CONTINUED BACK AND FORTH FOR MOST PART AVOIDING
                            ISSUES ON WHICH U.S. AND ALGERIAN POINTS OF VIEW DID NOT AGREE.
                            BOUTEFLIKA IN SEMI-SERIOUS VEIN REMARKED HOW BLATANTLY OPPORTUNISTIC
                            FRENCH HAVE BEEN IN THEIR COURTING OF ARABS EVEN THOUGH THEIR POSITION
                            ON MIDDLE EAST IS FAR LESS PRO-ARAB THAN IT APPEARS. HE ALSO SPOKE
                            SYMPATHETICALLY OF DILEMMA FACED BY U.S. AND UNFORTUNATE OPPORTUNITY IT
                            GAVE FOR “OUTSIDE POWER TO MOVE INTO AREA”. SEVERAL TIMES IN
                            CONVERSATION HE SINGLED OUT ALGERIAN POLICIES THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION TO
                            SOVIETS, SUCH AS ALGERIAN POSITION THAT ALL NON-MEDITERRANEAN FLEETS
                            SHOULD LEAVE MEDITERRANEAN.</p>
                        <p>12. REFERRING TO HAMDANI'S LIAISON ROLE, I SUGGESTED THAT IF THERE WERE
                            EVER ANY ASPECT OF U.S. POLICY THAT FONMIN WISHED TO CLARIFY HE SHOULD
                            HAVE HAMDANI COME IMMEDIATELY <pb n="6" xml:id="d19-06" facs="d19-06"
                            />TO US FOR EXPLANATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE HAD BEEN A FALSE DOCUMENT
                            CRICULATING AT RABAT SUMMITI BOUTEFLIKA BROKE IN TO SAY THAT THIS
                            DOCUMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ALGERIAN DELEGATION WITH REQUEST THAT
                            ALGERIAN PRESS PUBLISH IT. ALGERIANS HAD NOT BEEN SO EASILY TAKEN IN,
                            HOWEVER, SINCE THEY THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT GENUINE INSTRUCTIONS FROM
                            SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD BE CIRCULATING AT RABAT. I AGREED AND NOTED
                            ANOMALY IN EMBASSY ADEN'S BEING ADDRESSEE. AT ONE POINT IN CONVERSATION
                            FONMIN REFERRED DISPARAGINGLY TO “LATEST WORD OUT OF CAIRO” (HIS
                            EUPHEMISM FOR NASSER'S RECENT SPEECH) WHICH HE SAID HAD CASTIGATED USG
                            IN UNPRECEDENTED MANNER. INFERENCE WAS THAT HE CONSIDERED NASSER'S
                            ATTACK IRRESPONSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>13. AS CAN BE SEEN FROM ABOVE, CONVERSATION WHICH BEGAN IN A STRUCTURED
                            VEIN BECAME INCREASINGLY INFORMAL AND ENDED WITH BOUTEFLIKA APPLYING HIS
                            MOST CHARMING MANNER. IN REPLY TO HIS FRIENDLY CLOSING REMARKS, I SAID
                            THAT HE COULD BE CERTAIN DEPARTMENT WOULD INTERPRET HIS HAVING RECEIVED
                            CHIEF U.S. INTERESTS SECTION ALGIERS AS A POSITIVE STEP IN IMPROVEMENT
                            IN U.S.-ALGERIAN RELATIONS. HE REPLIED THAT IF AT ANY TIME I WISHED TO
                            SEE HIM PERSONALLY ON ANY IMPORTANT OR URGENT MATTER, I SHOULD LET
                            HAMDANI KNOW AND HE WOULD RECEIVE ME AT ONCE. (CHIEFS OF MISSION OFTEN
                            WAIT WEEKS FOR INTERVIEWS WITH BOUTEFLIKA.)</p>
                        <p>14. COMMENT: THIS IS FIRST TIME BOUTEFLIKA HAS RECEIVED A U.S. DIPLOMATIC
                            REPRESENTATIVE IN ALGIERS SINCE 1967 BREAK. HE NOW SEEMS TO WISH TO MOVE
                            RELATIONS FORWARD ON BASIS PERSONAL CONTACT HE ESTABLISHED WITH
                            SECRETARY AT OCTOBER I0 MEETING IN NEW YORK. HIS REQUEST RE <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HELP IN FINANCING EL PASO DEAL SEEMED
                            SOMEWHAT NAIVE. PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN BRIEFED TO PRESS FOR SECRETARY'S
                            HELP ONLY IN OBTAINING EXIMBANK LOANS COVERING EQUIPMENT PURCHASES IN
                            U.S., THOUGH HE GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE EXPECTED EXIMBANK TO HELP
                            PUT TOGETHER FINANCIAL PACKAGE FROM OTHER U.S. SOURCES. WHATEVER HIS
                            EXPECTATIONS, HIS APPROACH PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RE-ESTABLISH
                            HIGH LEVEL CONTACT WITHIN GOA AND FURTHER TEST ALGERIA'S DESIRE TO
                            IMPROVE RELATIONS. I WILL HOPE TO OBTAIN GUIDANCE ON SUBSTANCE OF OUR
                            INITIAL REPLY AND FUTURE TACTICS AT KINSHASA CONFERENCE.</p>

                        <p>1. THIS MESSAGE SUMMARIZES HIGH POINTS OF MEETING HELD 9 FEB 1700 HOURS
                            IN RABAT BETWEEN THE SECRETARY AND ALGERIAN AMBASSADOR TO MOROCCO, AMB
                            OSMAN. THE MEETING WAS HELD AT RESIDENCE OF THE MOROCCAN DIRECTOR OF THE
                            ROYAL CABINET.</p>
                        <p>2. SECRETARY TOLD AMBASSADOR USG IS WILLING TO CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD
                            IMPROVING RELATIONS AND ASKED FOR SUGGESTIONS AMB MIGHT HAVE. AMB
                            REPLIED THAT WHEN HIS PRESIDENT CAME TO RABAT, HE DISCUSSED WITH KING
                            QUESTION OF HIS COUNTRY'S RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. EARLIER
                            TODAY KING HAD SAID UNITED STATES ATTACHES NO CONDTION TO RENEWAL OF
                            RELATIONS. AMB SAID HE VERIFIED THIS BY CALLING HIS FOREIGN MINISTER. HE
                            RECALLED THAT IN HIS MEETING WITH THE SECY IN NEW YORK, THE FOREIGN
                            MINISTER HAD EXPLAINED HIS COUNTRY HAD BROKEN OFF RELATIONS FOR TWO MAIN
                            REASONS: THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE FAR EAST. ON THE FIRST SCORE HIS
                            COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ENCOURAGING INITIATIVE ON PART OF U.S. HE
                            SAID GOA BELIEVED U.S. SHOULD NO LONGER EXTEND UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT TO
                            ISRAEL. U.S. HAS INTERESTS IN THE ARAB WORLD, IT HAS REASONS TO LEAN
                            TOWARDS ISRAEL BUT IT MUST BE ABLE TO STRIKE A BALANCE. CITING WHAT HE
                            THOUGHT TO BE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >ROGERS</persName>' DEC 9 STATEMENT AND PRESIDENT <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>'S LATER MESSAGE TO JEWISH
                            LEADERS, THE AMB ASKED IF THERE WERE NEW ELEMENT.</p>
                        <p>3. SECY RESPONDED USG WOULD LIKE RENEW DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS NOT IN
                            CONTEXT OF EAST-WEST RELATIONS OR OUR RELATIONS TO ISRAEL BUT BECAUSE WE
                            DEEM IT DESIRABLE TO HAVE RELATIONS AND FEEL THAT MAGHREB COUNTRIES <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d20-02" facs="d20-02"/>COULD CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY
                            TO THIS REGION. BUT THERE WAS NO HURRY. STEPS WE HAD TAKEN SO FAR HAD
                            BEEN DESIRABLE STEPS TO TAKE AND WE WERE PLEASED WITH THEM AND WE WERE
                            READY TO MOVE WHENEVER HIS COUNTRY WAS READY. SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT
                            ONE COULD HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH A COUNTRY WITHOUT NECESSARILY
                            HAVING TO AGREE WITH THAT COUNTRY ON EVERY POINT. IT WAS IMPORTANT IN
                            FACT TO HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH A COUNTRY WITH WHICH ONE
                            DIFFERED. WE WERE HESITANT HERE AT THE THOUGHT THAT RELATIONS WOULD BE
                            BROKEN OFF IF THERE WAS ANOTHER DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN US.</p>
                        <p>4. CONCERNING THE MIDDLE EAST OUR SOLE CONCERN WAS TO BRING PEACE. WE HAD
                            MANY FRIENDS BOTH ARAB AND ISRAELI AND WE WERE IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE
                            POSITION OF ALWAYS BEING CASTIGATED BY ONE OR THE OTHER. OUR POLICY WAS
                            CONTAINED IN THE DEC 9 SPEECH. IT COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A PRO-ISRAEL
                            STATEMENT. PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> PRESS
                            CONFERENCE CLEARLY STATED DEC 9 SPEECH REPRESENTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S
                            POLICY. SECRETARY EMPHASIZED WE OPPOSED ISRAEL'S EXPANSIONISM AND WILL
                            CONTINUE DO SO. WE ALSO OPPOSED TO IDEA ISRAEL MAY BE DESTROYED AND WILL
                            CONTINUE OPPOSE THIS. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE
                            CAN FOR PEACE. WE DOUBT THE SOVIET UNION IS SO INCLINED ITSELF. THE
                            SOVIETS ARE DOING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT. THEY THRIVE ON TURMOIL AND
                            USUALLY GAIN THEIR OBJECTIVES IN THAT FASHION.</p>
                        <p>5. SECY THEN ASKED IF VIETNAM CONTINUED TO BE A PROBLEM. THE AMB SAID
                            THIS NO LONGER THE CASE. THEY WERE PLEASED WITH VIETNAMIZATION PROGRAM
                            AND TROOP WITHDRAWAL AND WERE CONTENT THAT VIETNAMESE SHOULD BE LEFT TO
                            SETTLE THEIR PROBLEMS AMONG THEMSELVES. HE CONCLUDED BY STRESSING HIS
                            COUNTRY'S DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED STATES. HIS COUNTRY HAD
                            MANY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DID NOT WISH TO EXCLUDE THE
                            UNITED STATES FROM PARTICIPATION IN THEM. SECY POINTED OUT THAT USG
                            PARTICIPATION WAS NOT EASY ABSENCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BUT WE WOULD
                            HELP WHERE WE COULD FACILITATE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. HE ASKED AMB TO
                            TRANSMIT HIS PERSONAL REGARDS TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND EXPRESS THE
                            DESIRE TO KEEP DIALOGUE OPEN.</p>

                        <p>1. Department continues to favor expansion commercial relations with
                            Algeria. It has become increasingly clear, however, that our ability to
                            encourage this relationship by positive acts is likely to be limited by
                            lack of progress toward settlement of outstanding claims of American
                            nationals against Algeria and disputes with American corporations. We
                            have on several occasions tried to make this clear to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>, most recently in Secretary's message
                            to Bouteflika (State 032269). We wish to avoid giving Algerians
                            impression our moves are related only to EL PASO project or that we are
                            pressing them too hard. At same time, we consider Bouteflika's request
                            that the Secretary facilitate El Paso project an important initiative to
                            which we are attempting to be responsive.</p>
                        <p>2. We are hopeful that SONATRACH President <persName corresp="#p_GA1"
                                >Ghozali</persName>'s recent statements to Gibson (Algiers 592 and
                            595) indicate Algerian awareness of desirability of reaching settlement
                            with oil companies. Department suggests you seek early meeting with
                            Ghozali to explore his approach including status of disputes with
                            American oil companies mentioned reftels. Further, you should make clear
                            to Ghozali that statement which <pb n="2" xml:id="d21-02" facs="d21-02"
                            />appeared in “International Commerce” that settlement of disputes will
                            probably have to await Govt to Govt negotiations after resumption of
                            relations does not represent Department policy. We believe the sooner
                            progress can be shown toward settlement of claims and disputes the
                            better. Absence of diplomatic relations need not delay this effort.

                            case before FTC should provide you with most recent info available to
                            Dept. As you noted in Algiers 592, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            is unable to speak for oil companies. In any case, we envisage your
                            first meeting with <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghozali</persName> as
                            exploratory and largely for purpose of assuring that Gibson conveyed
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Ghozali</persName>'s statements
                            accurately. We leave to your discretion whether or not to have <persName

                        <p>3. Concurrently, you should seek appointment with Ould-Rouis or
                            equivalent level Foreign Ministry official to initiate talks on claims
                            arising from GOA 1963 nationalizations, eleven of which were submitted
                            to GOA in late 1965 <pb n="3" xml:id="d21-03" facs="d21-03"/>and early
                            1966 (there may be additional claimants who have not furnished complete
                            dossier). As you aware, GOA recognized principle of compensation or
                            restitution at its discretion in these cases before negotiations ceased
                            with rupture of diplomatic relations in June 1967. You should have
                            sufficient documentation on hand to make this initial approach. You
                            should make clear that we consider settlement of these claims in
                            interest of long-range US-Algerian relations since outstanding nature of
                            these claims make <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> actions favorable
                            to Algeria considering more difficult than would otherwise be the case.
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We will want GOA reaction to
                            reopening of these claims before proceeding further. If GOA should
                            respond that it is unable to undertake substantive discussion of claims
                            pending consideration of French, Swiss, Italian and other claims, you
                            should make clear that this is problem between GOA and those
                            governments, but is not in our opinion sufficient reason to delay
                            progress on US claims. END <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>You will recall greeting FRANK BORMAN in San Clemente upon his return
                            from the POW mission to world capitals as your personal emissary. Borman
                            has told us of his extremely cordial and friendly reception in Algiers
                            where he met both with President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName>. It is our understanding
                            that Borman's stop in Algeria was, in fact, the highlight of his
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>He reports that:</p>
                        <p>— On the POW issue, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>
                            expressed interest in being helpful but felt that the opposition
                            considers the prisoners their trump card at the Paris negotiations.
                            However, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> promised to raise the question during a
                            forthcoming trip to Hanoi.<lb/> — On the Mid-East situation, both
                            leaders made these points in a lengthy discussion:<lb/> — The <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> Plan was a good first step but a
                            Palestinian role will have to be taken into consideration.<lb/> — A U.S.
                            presence is definitely needed to offset Soviet intrusion into the
                            area.<lb/> — There is nothing specific troubling US-Algerian relations
                            except the overall Mid-East context which prevented resumption of formal
                            relations at this time. [<persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> went so far as to say that the Algerians
                            would like to find a “political hook” on which to hang resumption.]<lb/>
                            — Economic cooperation between our two nations was flourishing and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> hoped that
                            economic, technical and commercial ties would expand.<lb/> — President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> extended his best
                            wishes to you.</p>

                        <p>State feels that Borman's reception—in the absence of diplomatic
                            relations—was noteworthy and recommends that you send a note of thanks
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> for his hospitality
                            to Borman as a way of keeping the lines open to the Algerian leader.</p>
                        <p>There is also a related action. Presidential confidant, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZR1">Rachid Zeghar</persName>, who performs liaison
                            functions with our Interests Section in Algeria and who helped to
                            arrange Borman's visit, gave Borman some gifts—for you, a dagger which
                            belonged to Algeria's most famous 19th century figure, Emir Abdelkadar,
                            and for Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Julie two
                            intricately woven brocade gowns from Constantine. These gifts should be
                            acknowledged, although it will be difficult for you to send a letter to
                            Zeghar if you do not send one to President <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The issue is whether you wish to capitalize on the opportunity that the

                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. By all accounts, the
                            Algerians went out their way to make Borman's layover a success and they
                            seized the opportunity to express interest in improving ties with
                            us.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our relationship with Algeria at the moment is primarily a
                            pragmatic, economic one. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> has categorically stated that his primary
                            interest is in economic development. He is anxious to have greater
                            access to U.S. energy markets, capital resources and technology, and
                            commercial ties with the U.S. have flourished even in the absence of
                            diplomatic relations. It can be assumed that the main interest in
                            resuming relations would be to improve access to the U.S. for commercial
                            reasons, rather than for any shift in political ideology. Most recently,
                            we have reports that the Algerians are sending small arms resupply to
                            the Palestinian fedayeen, and there is little to suggest that they will
                            not continue ideological and practical support for so-called liberation
                            movements of all kinds, including the Black Panthers. It is interesting
                            to note, nevertheless, that they have just recently upgraded their
                            Interests Section here in Washington. However, the Head of our Interests
                            Section who is here on consultation <pb n="3" xml:id="d22-03"
                                facs="d22-03"/>does not overrate the chances for resumption of
                            relations in the near future.</p>
                        <p>With reference to <persName corresp="#p_ZR1">Rachid Zeghar</persName>'s
                            gifts, they were not apparent as part of the official Algerian
                            reception. Two letters—to <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZR1"
                                >Zeghar</persName>—might have the effect of diluting the first. A
                            single letter to <persName corresp="#p_ZR1">Zeghar</persName> would be
                            awkward. Lucy Ferguson would have no problem acknowledging the gifts

                            December 16 in accordance latter's request for opportunity make courtesy
                            call. After preliminary exchange, during which Secretary complimented
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> on his appointment
                            as head of “upgraded” Algerian Interests Section, Secretary asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> to convey his best
                            wishes to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName>, whom he regretted not having seen at this
                            year's General Assembly session but hoped to see again. Secretary then
                            expressed belief that US policy in Middle East had assumed more
                            “even-handed” character since his meeting with Bouteflika a year ago.
                            Noted that US policy in Middle East is now subject to criticism by
                            Israelis as well as Arabs. Secretary noted <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> in handling Middle East problem sometimes felt like
                            tennis ball: it gets hit from both sides of the net but game could not
                            go on without it.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>, replying courteously
                            to Secretary's <pb n="2" xml:id="d23-02" facs="d23-02"/>compliments on
                            his appointment, stated he also wished convey Bouteflika's best wishes
                            to Secretary. Referring to Secretary's comments on policy, he indicated
                            that despite policy differences between Algeria and the US, GOA wished
                            emphasize common interests of both countries as basis for cooperation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> noted US commercial
                            activity with Algeria had increased over 100 per cent since 1967 break
                            in diplomatic ties. He expressed confidence strengthening of Algerian-US
                            economic relations would lay foundation for increased cooperation
                            between both countries in future.</p>
                        <p>3. In reply to Secretary's comment that diplomatic relations should exist
                            between countries despite their differences over policy, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> stated that he, personally,
                            saw his assignment to Washington as one step to be followed by others in
                            expanding relations.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary then inquired re Algerian policy with respect to acceptance
                            so-called political refugees and exiles. <pb n="3" xml:id="d23-03"
                                facs="d23-03"/>Secretary indicated that he thought he understood
                            policy but that he was puzzled by Algerian acceptance of certain
                            individuals, such as Timothy Leary. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> explained policy as one occasionally marked
                            by mistakes which he attributed to “youthfulness.” Stated that Algeria
                            had been surprised by arrival of Leary who had literally “dropped from
                            the skies,” GOA had endeavored to fob him off on Lebanese and Egyptians,
                            both of whom, however, shunted him back to Algiers. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> concluded by stating GOA
                            fully recognizes “danger Leary poses for Algerian youth” and that he is
                            being kept under surveillance to prevent any contact with Algerian
                            youth.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> of
                            Department's desire to be of every assistance in facilitating his
                            mission and expressed appreciation for courtesies and assistance given
                            by GOA to <persName corresp="#p_EWLJ1">Eagleton</persName> and members
                            of USINT Algiers. In response to Secretary's query re his family,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d23-04" facs="d23-04"/>indicated he would be returning
                            to US with his wife and four children and declared that he thought his
                            children would greatly benefit from their sojourn here.</p>
                        <p>6. Following meeting <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            expressed deep appreciation of Secretary's consideration in receiving
                            him despite Secretary's heavy schedule. He obviously pleased with range
                            of initial contacts he has made in Department and deeply impressed by
                            Secretary's warm, friendly welcome and informal manner. Bousselhamls own
                            manner has been markedly outgoing and it was obvious after first few
                            minutes with Secretary that he felt very much at
                            ease.<lb/>GP-3<lb/>END</p>

                        <p>1. French Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> called
                            on Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            April 6 in connection with Ambassador's planned consultations Paris next
                            week. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> indicated he would
                            appreciate rundown on US-GOA relations, particularly <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intentions with respect to importation
                                <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> from Algeria.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> indicated he welcomed
                            opportunity review subject with Ambassador as he had done with Le
                            Gourrierec and Landy in February. Recalled that at that time he had
                            assured Quai representatives <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            respects French role in Algeria and that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> has no intention creating any difficulties for France
                            in its relations with Algeria, particularly at this difficult time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> indicated we aware
                            doubts in some French circles re US intentions with respect to French
                            interests in Algeria and North Africa generally. He therefore welcomed
                            opportunity <pb n="2" xml:id="d24-02" facs="d24-02"/>repeat assurances
                            he had given to Le Gourrierec this subject.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted many of doubts re
                            US role in Algeria stemmed from activities private American companies
                            there. He stated such activities were taken on initiative of companies
                            themselves and without stimulation by <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>. For example, EL PASO arrangement with SONATRACH for
                            importation <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> was begun by company on
                            its own over two years ago. Matter was brought to attention of
                            Department and other agencies of government only as requirement for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> role, such as <gloss
                                target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> approval, became evident. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> indicated there are three
                            aspects of El Paso matter which relevant to timing of decisions <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will be called upon to make: progress
                            toward settlement claims by American companies against GOA; <gloss
                                target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> hearings; and, finally, Eximbank
                            consideration of loan requested by SONATRACH.</p>
                        <p>4. Re claims, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stated
                            settlements had now been <pb n="3" xml:id="d24-03" facs="d24-03"/>made
                            on all with exception of Esso and Newmont Mining, with prospects for
                            Esso settlement good. Re <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> hearings on
                            El Paso application for <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> imports
                            scheduled begin April 8 and first place would require number of weeks
                            for completion. FPC would determine whether such imports were in
                            national interest. Some opposition to imports expected. Re Eximbank,
                            Algerians probably under impression SONATRACH loan would be made if
                            settlement of company claims effected. However, Eximbank action on
                            SONATRACH application for $285 million loan probably would remain in
                            abeyance for several weeks. Sometime after commencement first phase
                                <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> hearings, Department would be
                            submitting letter to <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> in response
                            latter's request as to whether there exists any objection on foreign
                            policy grounds to importation of <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss>. In
                            response Lucet's query, <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            said letters in previous cases had indicated no such objection and so
                            far as he now aware this was probably position Department would <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="d24-04" facs="d24-04"/>take in El Paso case.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> then commented that it
                            appeared probable that in normal course of events <gloss
                                target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> approval would be obtained for <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> imports and Eximbank would be <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d24-05" facs="d24-05"/>favorably disposed to loan. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> concurred while noting decision
                            by <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> and Eximbank not predetermined
                            and in any event several weeks away. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> further noted that Eximbank would not take all of
                            $285 million loan; roughly half would have to be sought from private
                            banks under Eximbank guarantee. Newsom noted parenthetically that $285
                            million covered Arzew liquefaction plant. Total expenditures in project
                            as a whole, by Algerians as well as El Paso, would amount to about one
                            billion. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> appeared impressed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> further noted several
                            of tankers required by El Paso would be constructed in French
                            shipyards.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> then asked whether there
                            was any significantly new development in US-Algerian political
                            relations. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that
                            while commercial and economic ties appeared to be evolving
                            significantly, broader <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-Algerian
                            relations appear to be pretty much same as they had been in the past. We
                            and Algerians talk more <pb n="6" xml:id="d24-06" facs="d24-06"/>to each
                            other than was case a year or so ago, and Algerians now tend to include
                            head of USINT Algiers in more functions than was case in past, most
                            notably in funeral ceremonies for Colonel Chabou. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> also noted that Algerians, after
                            delay of more than a year since Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> had discussed subject, had finally sent
                            senior diplomat to head Algerian Interests Section Washington last
                            December.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lucet</persName> expressed appreciation
                            briefing by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>. Indicated he
                            would return from Paris around April 21 and would provide Quai views at
                            that time. He felt certain, however, US Embassy Paris already fully
                            informed his government's interests and concerns this whole
                            subject.<lb/>GP-3<lb/>END</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                        <p>Algeria is the most dynamic and important nation of North Africa. It has
                            a young aggressive leadership that appears determined to maintain
                            Algeria's political independence from any major power, while drawing
                            pragmatically on outside capital and technology to exploit its natural
                            resources and develop the country. This approach has led rapidly to a
                            substantial improvement in U.S.-Algerian relations, both political and
                            economic. We see our broad interests well served if this trend
                            continues. Algeria has settled satisfactorily the compensation claims of
                            American corporations, and is actively reviewing the private American
                            claims. There is now a potentially very large market for U.S. technology
                            and capital in Algeria. As the economy expands, significant private U.S.
                            investment opportunities in the form of joint partnerships should
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. demands for fuel energy are outpacing supply, and the
                            contemplated El Paso-SONATRACH project for the importation Algerian gas
                            will play a significant role over the next twenty years. We also see
                            this project, of such importance to the Algerians, as associating them
                            closely with western (specifically U.S.) economic interests.</p>
                        <p>It is not in our interest to work actively to undermine the historic
                            French position in Algeria. France itself is too important for us to
                            attempt anything so antagonistic and, despite their troubles; the
                            remaining ties of the French with Algeria cannot easily be broken.
                            Realistically, however, we expect the Algerians to move away from the
                            French (as they are already doing in the critical petroleum sector). We
                            do see it to be in our interests to fill, at least in part, a vacuum
                            left by the French in this strategically, economically and politically
                            important North African and Mediterranean country. We consider a close
                            relationship with the countries of Western Europe, and not to turn to
                            the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. U.S. Interests in Algeria</p>
                        <p>1. Because of its geographic position, substantial resources (chiefly in
                            petroleum and natural gas) and its leadership, Algeria is potentially
                            the most important country in the Maghreb.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d25-04" facs="d25-04"/>
                        <p>2. The Algerian interest in economic development and in access to U.S.
                            technology offers opportunities for U.S. exports of capital equipment
                            and for services.</p>
                        <p>3. As its economy expands, peripheral but profitable areas for U.S.
                            private investment may develop, probably through partnership
                            arrangements with the Algerian state.</p>
                        <p>4. The US strategic interest in Algeria derives from its geographic
                            location and NATO's responsibility for defense of western Europe while
                            denial of military operating rights in Algeria will not significantly
                            restrict NATO's ability to carry out its mission in the Mediterranean,
                            which would be contrary to our interests if the Soviet role as Algeria's
                            chief supplier of military equipment resulted in basing privileges for
                            Soviet military units.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. U.S. Objectives Over the Next Five Years</p>
                        <p>1. Improvement of the U.S.-Algerian dialogue on matters of mutual
                            interest through the reestablishment of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>2. Significant progress in settlement of the private American claims
                            against Algeria.</p>
                        <p>3. Access to Algerian natural gas on a long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>4. Expansion of U.S. commercial exports to Algeria and development of
                            service arrangements.</p>
                        <p>5. Encouragement of a continued Western European, as well as American,
                            interest in Algeria, chiefly as an offset to Algerian reliance or
                            dependence on Soviet technical and military assistance.</p>

                            States</p>
                        <p>1. Access to the growing U.S. market for natural gas.</p>
                        <p>2. Access to U.S. official and private sources of capital to assist in
                            Algeria's economic development.</p>

                            freedom of political maneuver, i.e., to keep its critical distance from
                            the U.S. on major world political issues.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Recommended Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>1. Use Algeria's economic interests as a lever to obtain progress on the
                            reestablishment of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>2. Get Algerians moving on reexamination of U.S. private claims with a
                            view to consolidating them and finding an imaginative solution.</p>
                        <p>3. Support arrangements for the export of Algerian natural gas to the
                            U.S. as a function of overall improvement in U.S.-Algerian relations;
                            encourage maximum American participation in related projects.</p>
                        <p>4. Expand economic and commercial activities of U.S. Interests Section to
                            promote further increases in U.S. exports of goods, services, and
                            technical/managerial skills.</p>
                        <p>5. Promote higher level American-Algerian contacts in Algeria and the
                            U.S. on the basis of the mutual interests involved.</p>
                        <p>6. Conduct quiet educational, information and cultural activities as
                            exemplified by ongoing Mission support for programs of English teaching,
                            American studies and cultural presentations, in a continuing effort to
                            improve the general atmosphere of U.S.-Algerian relations.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> (Tab A)
                            recommends that you authorize State to inform the Federal Power
                            Commission (<gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss>) that on foreign policy
                            grounds it has no objections to the approval of the applications of
                            three U.S. firms to import natural gas from Algeria.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issues</p>
                        <p>There is general agreement that the U.S. will require natural gas imports
                            from foreign sources to meet future requirements, that U. S. exports
                            will benefit from the project (Ex-Im has already approved a preliminary
                            commitment of $256.5 million for construction of facilities for the
                            project in Algeria), and that it would improve relations with Algeria
                            while reducing Soviet influence and strengthening elements within
                            Algeria who favor closer ties with the U.S. The security risk of
                            depending on foreign supplies is minimal, since these imports from
                            Algeria represent only about 1.5 percent of U.S. consumption, a large
                            number of foreign sources are being actively considered as future
                            sources of natural gas, gas is not essential to our military machine,
                            and domestic gas by virtue of its lower price will be favored over
                            foreign gas.</p>
                        <p>The major issue concerns the question of Algeria expropriation of foreign
                            property, both U.S. and non-U.S. After discussing the expropriation
                            problem with Secretary Connally you directed that we hold up on this
                            project. However, I now believe that the expropriation issue should not
                            stand in the way of our approval. Several important changes have
                            occurred:</p>
                        <p>—U.S. Expropriated Property - Algeria recently settled all expropriation
                            claims with U.S. petroleum companies. Some smaller claims remain
                            unresolved; but Algeria has indicated a willingness to settle these
                            claims, making payments through El Paso revenues.</p>
                        <p>—French Expropriated Property - Last February Algeria nationalized French
                            gas interests, including part of the field which will be the origin of
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d26-03" facs="d26-03"/>gas exports to the U.S. In
                            March, President <persName corresp="#p_PG1">Pompidou</persName> asked
                            that we take no action that would complicate Franco/Algerian relations
                            while negotiations for nationalized properties were under way. In April
                            (Tab B) you replied through Ambassador Watson that there would be no
                            preliminary Ex-Im Bank commitment to Algeria for six or seven weeks,
                            that State Department would have to give the <gloss target="#t_FPC1"
                                >FPC</gloss> its views on gas imports from Algeria in response to a

                            that we did not expect a final <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss>
                            decision until September. In response, <persName corresp="#p_PG1"

                            proposed El Paso natural gas project in Algeria were prepared in
                            response to a Department of State request for an intelligence assessment

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> is clearly
                            in charge of Algeria. His regime has no credible challengers in sight,
                            but the system is dependent on his personal leadership. His departure
                            from the scene could bring on considerable political uncertainty.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> will continue
                            pressing his policies of state ownership or control of all major
                            economic enterprises in Algeria, and of developing heavy industry, even
                            at the cost of agricultural stagnation and heavy unemployment.</p>
                        <p>B. Out of interest and sentiment, Algeria remains non-aligned and
                            generally aloof from most other countries. Save for the Arab-Israeli
                            dispute, it will continue to be little interested in most developments
                            in Arab states and other parts of the Third World. But the Palestinian
                            issue does arouse strong feelings in Algeria; in times of an acute
                            Arab-Israeli crisis (as in June 1967) the government might feel
                            compelled to take at least temporary action against Israel's supporters
                            even at the expense of Algeria's own economic interests.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> skillfully plays off
                            the major powers against one another. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has provided nearly all of Algeria's arms and some <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d27-03" facs="d27-03"/>economic aid, and France a
                            variety of economic and other benefits including some military
                            assistance in recent years. Much expensive American equipment and many
                            technicians are being used by the national oil industry. In addition,
                            the US offers a potentially large market for Algeria's gas reserves. In
                            no case, however, have the Algerians allowed themselves to come under
                            strong influence from any outside power, nor are they likely to.</p>
                        <p>D. A substantial oil producer, Algeria will continue to rely on rising
                            oil revenues to pay for its increasingly expensive development projects.
                            Its February 1971 partial nationalization of two French oil companies
                            (the only large foreign-owned concerns left in Algeria) promises Algeria
                            increased income from its petroleum. Though this move set off a fairly
                            serious crisis with the French, tensions are now receding. An accord has
                            been reached with one French company and, over time, probably will be
                            with the other one as well.</p>
                        <p>E. But Algeria's best hopes for added income probably lie in its mostly
                            unexploited natural gas reserves, which are among the three or four
                            largest in the world. Its first effort to export major quantities of
                            natural gas has been its agreement with the El Paso Natural Gas Company
                            of the US. If this is approved, the Algerians would begin shipping gas
                            to the US in the mid- or late-1970s, and would initially receive about
                            $120 million a year in new export earnings. Algeria probably sees this
                            as but a beginning and will push for further foreign gas sales.</p>

                            El Paso project, and Algeria's long-term reliability as an energy

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>1. Algeria has had more of an impact on the international scene than its
                            small population and its newness as a nation would seem to warrant. This
                            has resulted, at least in large part, from the actions of an aggressive
                            and intensely nationalistic leadership which has decolonized and
                            socialized the country's economy, adroitly played off several of the
                            great powers for his own benefit, and given loud verbal and some
                            material support to insurgencies in various parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. The Algerian commitment to a non-aligned international posture seems
                            to run deep, yet its attitude toward the US will also continue to be
                            conditioned by its irritation over the US stance in the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict. Such factors, along with the Algerian Government's record of
                            extremely tough dealings with foreign oil companies, raise questions
                            both about the general course of US-Algerian relations over the next
                            several years and about Algeria's long-term reliability as an energy
                            supplier for the US and Western Europe.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. DOMESTIC SCENE</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. The Regime and its Policies</p>
                        <p>3. President of the Revolutionary Council and of the council of Ministers
                            Houari Boumdiene is clearly in charge; he directs a dictatorial regime,
                            albeit not a very tyrannical one. Long the chief of the armed forces, he
                            seized power from Ahmed Ben Bella in 1885. Since then he has
                            consolidated his power, purged his opponents, quashed an attempted coup
                            in 1967 by the then armed forces' Chief of Staff Colonel Zbiri,and put
                            those loyal to him in the important posts. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> is almost totally lacking in charisma, a
                            respected but somewhat withdrawn figure. His authority derives not from
                            mass popularity but from the well equipped, well paid, and loyal
                            Algerian military and security establishment, particularly the
                            60,000-man army.</p>
                        <p>4. If <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>'s personality has
                            seemed enigmatic, his policies are not. He has, over the years, put
                            virtually all remaining foreign-owned <pb n="5" xml:id="d27-05"
                                facs="d27-05"/>properties and assets under Algerian ownership or
                            control. Until Independence, Algeria was dominated—politically,
                            socially, and economically—by the French. The 1962-1963 exodus of 90
                            percent of the million French residents of Algeria meant the abandonment
                            of their prosperous their government sinecures, and many of their
                            commercial enterprises to their former subjects. But a number of
                            factories, businesses, mines, oil operations, and other enterprises
                            continued under French and to a lesser extent other foreign ownership.
                            Since 1965, virtually all of these have been taken over and are now
                            being run by the Algerians' themselves. (1)</p>
                        <p>(1) At least until recently, the government has shown little interest in
                            socializing the properties of those relatively few affluent Algerian
                            professional men, estate owners, and capitalists who had previously
                            thrived under the French. This hands-off policy appears to be changing,
                            however. For example, an agrarian reform law just published calls for
                            the breakup of large Algerian landholdings.</p>
                        <p>5. Beyond ending foreign ownership and control, the regime has ambitious
                            long-term plans for the development of the nation's economy, which has a
                            mix of weaknesses and strengths. On the minus side, Algeria has a
                            problem of population pressure on available arable land—a problem
                            exacerbated by a very high birth rate. (Population is now 14 million
                            people; the rate of increase is 3.1 percent a year.) Unemployment is
                            extensive both in the cities and rural areas. Most Algerians are still
                            poor farmers, dependent on the weather for the growth of enough wheat to
                            feed themselves. Nearly all the best agricultural land had been taken
                            over by French settlers, who made most of it into large estates
                            producing wheat, citrus fruit, and wine for the metropole. These
                            properties are now operated by the ex-employees of the departed owners

                        <p>veterans and land-less peasants; management standards, productivity,
                            output, and personal incomes of the farmers themselves have all dropped
                            sharply. Further, the former protected French market for wine has been
                            cut off, and many Algerian vineyards are being slowly converted to the
                            production of other crops.</p>
                        <p>6. Though agriculture is the occupation of most Algerians, it is a matter
                            of fairly low priority to the government, which continues to allocate
                            limited resources to it. Rather, the regime is out to develop heavy
                            industry on a large-scale, and has many of the assets needed for such an
                            effort. Besides having a highly developed infrastructure inherited from
                            colonial days, the country is rich in exportable mineral resources:
                            principally oil, natural gas, and some iron ore. Algeria's gas reserves
                            are large, but only a fairly small amount has so far been exported.
                            Petroleum is another matter; Algeria is an important world oil producer.
                            Its income from the sale of oil reached some $650 million in hard
                            currency in 1970 (71 percent of its export earnings). This has enabled
                            the regime both to build up foreign exchange reserves of several hundred
                            million dollars, and to begin work on an ambitious scheme designed,
                            perhaps over two or more decades, to make Algeria an affluent industrial
                            power. This effort will be extremely expensive; it will require ever
                            larger imports of costly capital goods which in turn will depend on the
                            receipt of more and more foreign exchange. Greatly enhanced export
                            earnings over present levels, along with fairly strict austerity at home
                            to restrain import levels, will be needed to carry out such a
                            program.</p>
                        <p>7. The <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> regime has been
                            actively pursuing these policies over the past few years. A general belt
                            tightening and higher taxes have been imposed. Private foreign travel is
                            discouraged. Strict controls over imports of consumers goods are in
                            effect. A number of import substitution industries, such as textiles,
                            have been built. Efforts to get more petroleum revenues from—or in spite
                            of—the French <pb n="6" xml:id="d27-06" facs="d27-06"/>have been pursued
                            with tenacity. With the proposed El Paso agreement to export natural gas
                            to the US, efforts to earn large sums from Algeria's rich gas deposits
                            have begun. (2) Ten to 15 percent of current oil earnings are being
                            plowed back into exploration for more revenue yielding oil reserves, and
                            for the construction of more pipelines. The principal planned industrial
                            projects now underway, a steel mill and three petrochemical complexes,
                            are designed not to provide many new jobs, but to bring in new export
                            earnings and to provide further import substitutes. Concentrated
                            government efforts in these fairly limited areas have led the overall
                            Algerian economy to grow at a statistical rate of 5-6 percent a year,
                            despite the poor performance in the agricultural sector and the
                            continued low living standards of most of the people.</p>
                        <p>(2) Paragraphs 34-48 below discuss the El Paso project in detail.</p>
                        <p>8. Algeria continues to proclaim itself a socialist state, but it is an
                            unusual one. In practice, it is developing something akin to capitalism.
                            Government corporations, with varying efficiency, now operate such
                            specific sectors of economic activity as mining, textiles, and
                            petroleum—in all of which they have a monopoly. With the limits of basic
                            central government policies, each corporation is more or less
                            autonomous. The best known and most effective of these is SONATRACH, the
                            state corporation responsible for petroleum and natural gas. Developed
                            by the able Belaid Abdesselam, now the Minister of Industry and Energy,
                            SONATRACH has shown itself capable of handling all aspects of the
                            petroleum industry, including exploration, extraction, refining and
                            marketing. In these efforts they have had extensive help from hired
                            foreign advisors including Americans. It is too early to tell whether
                            SONATRACH will retain its present high standards, or whether other state
                            corporations will come to approach them. If they do, such competent
                            management would be of great assistance in achieving Algerian
                            development goals.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Political Prospects</p>
                        <p>9. We know of no opposition to <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> or his in the government or armed forces, The
                            public at large apparently continues to demonstrate the political apathy
                            prevalent since the end of the independence war. The government's
                            long-term development program, even with the austerity it entails,
                            appears to have fairly general acquiescence, save for the small but hard
                            pressed middle class. Nonetheless, the Algerian regime—no matter how
                            stable it now appears—remains a vulnerable one. The marginal living
                            standards of most of its farmers, the gross lack of employment
                            opportunities, the additional hardships imposed on the people by the
                            development program, the presence of a small educated bourgeoisie
                            chafing under rule by hardnosed, socialist army officers add up to the
                            potential for expressions of mass public unrest. There is no way of
                            predicting if or when popular explosions might occur, but they cannot be
                            ruled out.</p>
                        <p>10. The present system is highly dependent on the continued personal
                            leadership of <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. There is
                            no Deputy President or generally recognized number two; neither is there
                            any institutionalized procedure for choosing a successor. A new
                            constitution was promised years ago but has never been promulgated. Some
                            controlled local and regional elections have been held, but there have
                            been no national ones. There is a single official political party, the
                            National Liberation (FLN), and it is seeking to reorganize and
                            strengthen itself, but the FLN is so inherently weak and subordinate to
                            the government as to make it a negligible political force. Algeria is
                            still too new and its political traditions and institutions too
                            undeveloped to permit <pb n="7" xml:id="d27-07" facs="d27-07"/>a very
                            confident assessment of long-term prospects were <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> to lose his grip or leave the
                            scene altogether.</p>
                        <p>11. Were he to do so, the surviving principals in the Council of
                            Ministers and the army would probably step in at once and seek to play
                            the major role in ruling the country; they might institute some form of
                            collegial rule. But without Boumdiene's strong direction, splits—brought
                            on both by ideological and personal differences—and infighting could
                            easily develop over time. Indeed, there are already reports of disputes
                            among the top leadership; at least one minister is alleged to oppose the
                            regime's austerity measures. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>'s defeated rivals, BEN BELLA and Colonel
                            Zbiri, are still alive—the first under detention and the second in
                            exile; they both probably have some backing in the country. In any
                            event, while the domestic scene now appears stable and quiet, Algeria's
                            longer term political future is far from assured.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Algeria's Foreign Outlook</p>
                        <p>12. As a strategically located, potentially wealthy, moderately
                            influential Arab-African country, the Algerian Government is inclined
                            both by interest and sentiment to avoid alignment with any of the Great
                            Powers. Rather, it normally seeks, in the classic Third World pattern,
                            to play major outside states off against each other for its own benefit,
                            and it has become quite skilled in doing so. At the same time it
                            stubbornly resists efforts of outsiders to interfere in its affairs.</p>
                        <p>13. Ideology and sentiment, much of it created during the bloody
                            1954-1962 war of independence, usually incline the Algerians the same
                            way. During that war fought against the French, Algeria got little or no
                            assistance from either the US or the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> (for, of course, very different reasons), at least
                            until it became clear that victory was inevitable. (3) Fellow Arabs
                            provided arms, safe haven, and verbal support, but were careful not to
                            become directly Involved. Whatever outside assistance they received, the
                            Algerians believe that basically, it was because of their own fighting
                            heavy sacrifices that they won their independence. Innately suspicious
                            of outsiders anyway, and not particularly grateful to anyone, they
                            cherish freedom of action, and are very sensitive to any external
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>(3)The Algerian rebels did receive substantial arms, public support, and
                            diplomatic backing from the Chinese fairly early on. But in recent
                            years, the Algerian-Chinese relationship has been one of long distance
                            cordiality. China provides virtually no economic or military aid and the
                            level of mutual trade is very low.</p>
                        <p>14. Most politically aware Algerians have very strong feelings on the
                            Arab-Israeli dispute, feelings which could lead to moves against those
                            considered to be allies of the Israelis—particularly the US which, in
                            the eyes of many Algerians, is tainted with other sins as well. In times
                            of acute crisis, these sentiments can become so strong that the regime
                            cannot ignore them. In the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war, public opinion
                            was so aroused that the government felt impelled, though probably
                            reluctantly, to impose a temporary embargo on all trade with the US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (alleged to be fighting alongside
                            the Israelis) and to break diplomatic relations with the US (those with
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had been severed previously).
                            Though these moves had little short- or long-term practical effect, the
                            regime might, in a comparable situation, again feel it would have to
                            take similar measures, even at the price of damage to the Algerian
                            development effort or the economy as a whole.</p>
                        <p>15. Other than in such critical times, the Algerian Government does not
                            pay much attention to the Mideast situation. Despite its rigid <pb n="8"
                                xml:id="d27-08" facs="d27-08"/>anti-Israeli stand, its public
                            rejection of a ceasefire, its avowed refusal to countenance any
                            compromise settlement with the Israelis or to abandon the rights of the
                            Palestinian Arab people, the Boumediene regime's actual military and
                            economic involvement is negligible. In 1967 it did send a small military
                            force to join the Egyptians along the Suez Canal, but withdrew these
                            troops in 1970 when the Israeli cease-fire provided an excuse. Algeria
                            does provide Palestinian guerrillas with arms, training, and verbal
                            support—much as Arab countries far from the battlefield aided it in its
                            own war of independence. Otherwise, the Algerian leaders publicly and
                            privately express a low opinion of Eastern Arab officials and their
                            military forces; they are likely to continue, as much as possible, to
                            avoid real involvement in the problem of the Middle East.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Relations with the Third World</p>
                        <p>16. Algerian policy toward the rest of the Third World is partly a
                            function of geographical proximity. Tunisia and Morocco have loomed
                            quite large, beginning with the early 1960s, when relations with both
                            were seriously strained by mutual suspicions and as a consequence of
                            Moroccan and Tunisian claims on large parts of Algeria. In 1963, Morocco
                            bested Algeria in a brief border war; relations were tense throughout
                            the area during much of the 1960s. Subsequently, for a variety of
                            reasons including the shelving of the border claims and a gradual
                            appreciation of their common interests, the situation has greatly eased.
                            Relations have so improved that the three countries now envisage such
                            modest cooperative ventures as a joint international airline. Though
                            unforeseeable incidents could change this picture, Algeria's relations
                            with Tunisia and Morocco seem likely to remain fairly placid. Wealthier,
                            having no territorial claims against its neighbors, possessing the most
                            powerful military force in the area, Algeria now sees little threat in
                            the Maghreb, and maintains good bilateral relations with all its
                            neighbors. These circumstances will permit Algeria to concentrate on its
                            own parochial problems, though it will continue to give lip service to
                            the idea of some loose federation of the Maghreb states, and will hope
                            eventually to become the dominant state in the area.</p>
                        <p>17. Algeria's reaction to the abortive coup in Morocco was a careful one
                            of restraining comment until the situation became clear. Although the
                            Algerians sympathized with the idea of a republican Morocco and consider
                            it likely to come in time, the Boumediene regime fears the advent of an
                            erratic nationalistic Morocco, particularly one which might revive
                            territorial claims against Algeria, and thus apparently now prefers
                            predictable rule by King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>

                        <p>18. Algeria's relations with Africa have been marked by a declining
                            patience with the liberation movements and a growing emphasis on
                            governmental relations. The <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> government continues to support those African
                            rebels fighting the Portuguese, Rhodesians, and South Africans with
                            modest inputs of arms, training and propaganda. But its attention has
                            turned to improving relations with individual African states such as its
                            Saharan border neighbors—now objects of Algerian aid and training—and
                            certain states sharing other common interests.</p>
                        <p>19. Algeria's relations with most of the other, more distant peoples of
                            the Third World are relatively aloof. The principal exceptions to this
                            have been the Vietnamese Communists whom for years the Algerians have
                            sincerely and vehemently supported. The Algerians believe the Vietnamese
                            Communists have much in common with themselves in that they have, at
                            considerable sacrifice, mounted a major, <pb n="9" xml:id="d27-09"

                            great power. Further, the Algerians are asked for nothing but political,
                            diplomatic, and propaganda support—all of which are emotionally
                            satisfying, sincerely given, and cheap. As far as the other lesser
                            powers of the world are concerned, the <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> government pays little attention to them save
                            as potential customers.</p>

                        <p> 20. When Algerian independence came in 1962, formal diplomatic relations
                            with the Soviets were established, but little else. But as BEN BELLA
                            proclaimed himself a socialist revolutionary and an ideologue somewhat
                            on the Castro model, a thaw ensued and the Soviets extended large offers
                            of economic aid. When Algeria's ill-equipped army came off second best
                            against the Moroccans in the fall of 1963; BEN BELLA turned to Moscow
                            for military supplies and got a quick and gratifying response. By 1964,
                            Algeria was being vigorously lauded in the Russian media; BEN BELLA was
                            accorded a hero's welcome in Moscow and ties became quite close. BEN
                            BELLA's ouster in 1965 did not immediately change the appearance of
                            things; the Maghreb was engaged then and for some years in a cold war of
                            its own. The Soviets were accused of, or suspected to be supporting
                            Algeria in its quarrels with Morocco and Tunisia; the US came in for
                            similar accusations about backing Algeria's hostile neighbor. An image
                            of Algeria was publicized by some of its enemies depicting it as a new
                            North African Cuba, loyal to the socialist camp, under the strong
                            influence of if not direction from Moscow, shouting defiance at and
                            promoting revolution throughout the non-Communist world.</p>
                        <p>21. Such charges were not completely without foundation, at least in the
                            days of BEN BELLA. During 1963 and 1964, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> extended $231 million in economic credits, and $235
                            million in military grants and credits. Since <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> took power, the Soviets have extended $5
                            million in economic credits and $150 million in military assistance,
                            including a $100 million agreement signed in February 1971. The Algerian
                            Armed Forces are almost completely equipped with Soviet armaments. These
                            forces are of course dependent on Moscow for spare parts, ammunition and
                            the like. Some 1,000 Russian military technicians are in Algeria as
                            instructors in the use and maintenance of Soviet furnished equipment
                            including 149 jet fighters/fighter bombers, 325 tanks, 9 guided missile
                            patrol boats, and air defense radar and weapons including <gloss
                                target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2 missiles. About 2,000 Soviet economic
                            technicians are also present under the economic aid agreement.</p>
                        <p>22. The Soviets have not been able to translate this significant
                            investment of military and economic aid into a similar amount of
                            influence over the <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>
                            government. Although, under usual international rules, the Soviet Navy
                            may with prior permission call at certain Algerian civilian ports, all
                            Soviet attempts to obtain naval and air bases have been sharply
                            rebuffed. Contrary to some recent reports there are no Soviet combat
                            units, or Russian-piloted Tu-16s or Foxbats in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>23. There are several factors which have curbed Soviet influence. Most of
                            the military and economic aid was extended in BEN BELLA's day. Economic
                            credits have been drawn down very slowly; the Algerians show a marked
                            preference for Western equipment and know-how. The Algerians have sought
                            to limit their dependence on Soviet military support by buying small
                            amounts of such French equipment as jet trainers and by arranging for
                            military training programs in France and to a smaller degree in other
                            West European countries—<pb n="10" xml:id="d27-10" facs="d27-10"/>e.g.,
                            Italy. (4) The Algerians are also probably aware, whatever their
                            dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for ammunition
                            and military spare parts, that there is little likelihood of these being
                            cut off. A Russian arms embargo imposed on a non-aligned, Arab, often
                            anti-Western and pro-Soviet country would have extremely unfavorable
                            repercussions throughout the Middle East and the Afro-Asian world so far
                            as Moscow is concerned.</p>
                        <p>(4) Similarly the Algerians have blunted French economic pressures by
                            selling wine-embargoed by Paris and mostly unsalable elsewhere in the
                            West—to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, though on less
                            favorable terms to Algeria. Most vital export revenues, of course, are
                            earned in Western Europe and the US, and the Algerians clearly intend to
                            keep it that way.</p>
                        <p>24. Further, while normally not openly critical of Soviet foreign policy,
                            Algeria does not go along with Moscow on everything. Thus it has
                            regularly denounced the Russians for supporting the Middle East
                            ceasefire and the various efforts in and out of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to find a peaceful solution in that area.
                            The Algerian leaders have also demanded the departure of all
                            foreign—including Russian—naval forces from the Mediterranean. Thus
                            while Algeria has ties with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            which are often very useful and profitable, in the last analysis its
                            policies parallel those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            only when Algeria's own definition of its interests and sympathies
                            dictate. The ultimate test of this assessment would be whether the
                            Algerian Government would—like Egypt—permit regular Soviet military
                            forces to be based on its own territory. We doubt it very much. Unlike
                            Egypt, Algeria is not critically dependent on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for its defense, and it is hard to
                            conceive of its becoming so. It would probably take extreme
                            circumstances, such as another Arab-Israeli war in which the US was
                            believed to be directly involved on the Israeli side and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was thought to be fighting with the
                            Arabs to impel the Algerians to grant even temporary base privileges to
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>25. The city of Algiers has become and remains a principal safe haven for
                            revolutionary exiles from all over the world. American Black Panthers,
                            Quebec separatists, and South American prisoners released as ransom for
                            political kidnappings have been accepted and given accommodation. This
                            of course derives from Algeria's own “revolutionary” heritage. Algerian
                            enthusiasm for these non-African exiles—whom it provides little or
                            nothing more than the equivalent of room and board—may be waning. To our
                            knowledge, Algeria supports and subsides none of their activity against
                            their respective homelands. Rather it has viewed some, such as Dr.
                            Timothy Leary, with open hostility and others, such as Brazilian
                            revolutionaries and the Black Panthers with obvious discomfort. (5) One
                            reason, no doubt, is the incompatibility between extending support to
                            revolutionary militants on the one hand, and the desire for reasonably
                            good relations with the governments they oppose on the other.</p>
                        <p>(5) In early July, Algeria announced a set of stringent guidelines on the
                            treatment of airplane hijackers. If applied, they guarantee at least an
                            initial term in jail for anyone hijacking a plane to Algeria in all but
                            the most exceptional circumstances. Thus was an American citizen to
                            hijack a plane to Algiers, he would automatically be granted asylum only
                            if the US Government requested this be done.</p>

                        <p>26. Oil was discovered in Algeria by the French in the 1950s, and
                            production has grown continuously since. By 1970, output was close to
                            one million barrels per day (bpd). The value of this oil is enhanced by
                            its very low sulphur content and the fact that the fields are west of
                            Suez and relatively close to European markets. When Boumediene took over
                            in 1965, French companies produced about 70 percent of the total, other
                            European and <pb n="11" xml:id="d27-11" facs="d27-11"/>American firms
                            the rest. The non-French producers were taken over by the Algerian
                            Government between 1967 and 1970, and all were eventually nationalized
                            with mutually agreed on compensation.</p>
                        <p>27. Algerian relations with the two French companies (ERAP and CFP)
                            operating the remaining foreign-owned fields became more and more
                            strained in this period. Negotiations between the two governments
                            stretched on for nearly two years, and became more and more acrimonious
                            and inconclusive. (6) Finally, in February 1971, the Algerian Government
                            unilaterally nationalized enough of the French companies' assets to
                            raise its participation in them to 51 percent. Algerian managers were
                            put in charge, prices sharply raised, and compensation arbitrarily
                            set.</p>
                        <p>(6) Under the Franco-Algerian “special relationship” instituted by De
                            Gaulle, petroleum agreements were to be worked out on a state-to-state
                            basis, and entailed political as well economic considerations. The
                            recent negotiations covered a variety of disputes and issues, some of a
                            general political nature, some quite technical. In the last analysis,
                            however, nearly all were concerned with Algerian efforts (and French
                            resistance) to get control of operations and to obtain more money for
                            the oil.</p>
                        <p>28. The moves set off a serious though temporary French-Algerian crisis,
                            with many angry words and some acts by both sides. The French announced
                            that the “special relationship” with Algeria was dead. According to the
                            French, this meant that over time Algeria would no longer be given
                            special privileges (particularly as contrasted with Tunisia and Morocco)
                            with respect to immigration quotas, to tariff preferences, to technical
                            assistance programs at reduced costs, and to special quotas for wine
                            imports. Of immediate impact was the termination of a $65 million a year
                            financial aid program. Further, the French Government gave up
                            responsibility for negotiating with the Algerians on oil matters and
                            turned it over to CFP and ERAP. These companies' initial response was
                            tough—withdrawing French technicians from fields and refineries,
                            rejecting Algeria's terms for nationalization, refusing to lift any more
                            oil from Algerian ports, buying substitute oil elsewhere, and
                            threatening to take legal action against anyone who bought Algerian oil
                            (though they have not carried out this threat).</p>
                        <p>29. The Algerians responded by imposing a boycott on imports of all but
                            the most essential French goods, and harming French residents in
                            Algeria. They also issued announcements abut a series of favorable
                            agreements between SONATRACH and a host of American corporations
                            associated with the petroleum industry. Of greater consequence were
                            active and—so far—relatively successful efforts by SONATRACH to market
                            the oil from the formerly French-owned properties. By June 1971,
                            something over half the previous levels of petroleum exports were being
                            regularly sold to independent oil dealers in Europe. (7) Algeria, no
                            longer sharing the income with CFP and ERAP, was then getting about the
                            same revenue as before February 1971. Prospects are that sales will
                            continue to rise.</p>
                        <p>(7) At the time of nationalization, SONATRACH was producing roughly
                            300,000 bpd, ERAP 340,000, and CFP 280,000. In addition a few small
                            French and American companies collectively produced something under
                            100,000 bpd.</p>
                        <p>30. French recognition of this fact, along with the continuing strong,
                            though partly intangible, ties which still exist between the two
                            countries, have brought about an easing of the situation, and indeed the
                            likely end of the crisis. Algeria and CFP have signed a new agreement
                            apparently involving compromises on both sides. CFP accepted the terms
                            of nationalization and promised further investment in its share of
                            operations. The Algerians agreed to 20 percent higher compensation for
                            properties taken over, and apparently—though we do not know the exact
                            terms—to provide CFP <pb n="12" xml:id="d27-12" facs="d27-12"/>with oil
                            at prices lower than they had initially decreed. ERAP has begun
                            negotiations with Algeria. Its somewhat different circumstances are
                            bound to make the process of reaching an agreement more complicated
                            (CFP's Algerian holdings amounted to only about 20 percent of its
                            overseas producing assets before nationalization; in ERAP's case the
                            figure is roughly 80 percent). Nevertheless, an eventual accord with
                            ERAP now seems likely, though not certain.</p>
                        <p>31. Even if difficulties with ERAP continue, official Franco-Algerian
                            relations appear to have stabilized. The two remain major trading
                            partners. Algerian workers in France remain economically useful to both
                            (8) French language and culture struck very deep and pervasive roots in
                            the 130-year occupation (9 percent of the Algerians read and write only
                            French, 5 percent only Arabic, 11 percent both) and this will continue
                            for decades at least. Both parties continue to value the French cultural
                            and technical aid program, under which some 6,000 French teachers and
                            several thousand technicians are in Algeria. Politically the two are not
                            likely to be very cooperative; disputes, some acrimonious, are almost
                            certain, but none now appears likely to bring on a permanent rupture in
                            Franco-Algerian relations. Algeria serves as an important link for
                            France with the Arab world. France of course will serve as a useful
                            counter to other great powers, e.g., a potential supplier of arm and
                            training if the Soviets prove difficult, and as a potential source of
                            skills and market for gas if the US were to present problems.</p>
                        <p>(8) There are now over 800,000 Algerians in France. They hold low paying,
                            menial jobs which Frenchmen refuse to accept. Serving as a safety valve
                            for the Algerian population explosion, they also repatriate about $200
                            million a year to the homeland—supporting a number of unemployed
                            relatives and bolstering Algeria's exchange position. Barring a
                            total—and unlikely—rupture between the two nations, the present Algerian
                            residents in France will probably not be disturbed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The United States</p>
                        <p>32. A number of issues will continue to trouble US-Algerian relations.
                            These include Algerian resentment of US supply of military equipment to
                            France during the independence war, Algerian dislike of most US foreign
                            policies, the nationalization of US firms in Algeria, the sharply
                            differing ideological outlooks of the two countries, normal Algerian
                            suspicions of foreigners, and safe haven given exiles from the US. But
                            this again is not the complete picture. Determined to increase their
                            export earnings, the Algerians have evidently concluded that the US, of
                            all the developed countries, offers the most sophisticated skills and
                            the highest quality equipment needed to develop and operate complex
                            modern projects. And of course they see the US as a source of
                            development capital and as a potentially lucrative market for exports of
                            Algerian natural gas. Thus despite a good deal of harsh rhetoric, a
                            number of steps have been taken over the past few years which have put
                            US-Algerian relations on a more amicable basis than before.</p>
                        <p>33. Several hundred highly trained and well paid US specialists have been
                            hired, mostly by SONATRACH but also by other state corporations and the
                            government. Much sophisticated US equipment is being imported. Several
                            joint ventures, with an Algerian state corporation holding 51 percent of
                            the shares and a US firm 49 percent, have come into operation. These
                            include such schemes as construction of an elaborate computer center and
                            various advanced oil exploration projects. The cumulative value of these
                            projects is not negligible. There is little trade between the two
                            countries, outside that related to the petroleum industry. In 1969
                            Algeria imported about $80 million in goods and services from the
                            US.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d27-13" facs="d27-13"/>
                        <p>34. Along with this has been, over the put few years, the evolution and
                            negotiation of the proposed El Paso project, which would provide
                            substantial quantities of Algerian natural gas to the American market by
                            the mid- or late-1970s. If finally approved, it would entail total
                            investment (at 1970 prices) of about $1.2 billion, with the costs split
                            about evenly between SONATRACH and the El Paso Natural Gas Company,
                            SONATRACH, with loan and credit guarantees from the US Export-Import
                            Bank amounting to $285 million, would build a huge gas liquefaction
                            plant and a pipeline to the Hassi R'Mel gas field. The latter is a
                            sizeable one; even with the large volumes contemplated, only about 10
                            percent of it would be exploited. El Paso would order from 6 to 9
                            specially built liquid natural gas (<gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss>)
                            tankers, and construct facilities on the east coast of the US to
                            reconvert the <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> into gas. The entire
                            operation, even if approved immediately could not go into production
                            until 1975-1976 at the earliest, after which time Algeria would begin
                            receiving about $120 million a year in export earnings from it. But of
                            course the agreement would imply making the US a much larger trading
                            partner earlier than that.</p>
                        <p>35. There is little doubt that the Algerian Government has put a very
                            high priority on this arrangement, and for good reason. Algeria's
                            natural gas reserves are enormous (exceeded only by those of the US, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and possibly Iran), and
                            mostly untapped. They provide probably the only potential for sharply
                            increased earnings of the foreign exchange needed for the country's
                            ambitious industrial development programs. (9) With non-polluting
                            natural gas coming into greater demand in nearby Western Europe as well
                            as the US, the Boumediene regime clearly sees the El Paso project as the
                            first step in what could ultimately become a very large, very profitable
                            enterprise. (10)</p>
                        <p>(9) Algeria's proven petroleum reserves in relation to output are
                            relatively small. Some experts believe that unless substantial new
                            reserves are discovered soon, output will actually begin to drop within
                            a few years.</p>
                        <p>(10) It should be noted that while in February 1971 Algeria nationalized
                            51 percent of the French companies' petroleum assets; it took over 100
                            percent of their gas deposits. Prior to that time it had had the right
                            to purchase all the gas it wanted at the cost of production.</p>
                        <p>36. The spade work and negotiations with respect to the El Paso project
                            have led to a noticeable lessening of frictions between the Algerian
                            Government on the one hand and the US Government and American private
                            firms on the other. US oil properties which were originally sequestered
                            or confiscated have now been paid for on mutually agreed terms.
                            Day-by-day bilateral discussions are generally businesslike and not
                            characterized by propagandistic rancor. Vietnam and Israel are not
                            forgotten, but they are no longer very active subjects of debate.
                            US-Algerian relations are now—from the <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> government's point of view—principally
                            concerned with finding mutually acceptable means of enhancing Algeria's
                            profitable energy exports. In this context, the outcome of the pending
                            El Paso project will play a major role in determining future US-Algerian
                            relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. IMPLICATIONS OF THE EL PASO PROJECT</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A The Short-Term Outlook</p>
                        <p>37. Beyond a certain level of generalization, Algeria's immediate courses
                            of action following approval or disapproval of the El Paso project
                            cannot be specifically estimated in advance. Approval would strongly
                            reinforce the present even, businesslike atmosphere of US-Algerian
                            relations, but it would lead to no marked shift in Algeria's
                            international outlook, much less in its relationships with other <pb
                                n="14" xml:id="d27-14" facs="d27-14"/>powers. The Boumdiene regime
                            sees the El Paso contract as a commercial venture, and approval of the
                            deal would not give the US much political leverage over the prickly
                            Algerians. They would not react to US approval of the project with a
                            burst of gratitude, nor would they refrain from, say, counseling the
                            Libyans on courses of action which could ultimately lead the oil
                            companies there (80 percent US-owned) to face a future similar to that
                            of the companies formerly in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>38. Whether approval would lead the to take the initiative in restoring
                            diplomatic relations with the US is an open question; there are reasons
                            for and against their taking such a step. A diplomatic relationship
                            would enable each side more fully to staff its embassies, and thus
                            facilitate further commercial transactions. But the two powers retain
                            Interest Sections in the respective capitals which have become embassies
                            in everything but the formal trappings of protocol. They provide—as the
                            El Paso negotiations have shown—adequate means for the two countries to
                            deal with each other. Further, the break in 1967 was essentially a
                            symbolic protest against US Middle Eastern policy; in Algerian eyes, the
                            latter has changed but little. Other Arab countries that broke relations
                            with the US in 1967 have not made any move to restore them. For all
                            their independence of, and sense of superiority to, other Arabs, the
                            Algerians are likely to be wary about taking such a conspicuous first
                            step, particularly if it seemed to be part of a single commercial
                            project. But, over time, particularly if other economic ties should
                            grow, the prospects of restoring diplomatic relations would be enhanced
                            as a result of the El Paso deal.</p>
                        <p>39. Disapproval of the El Paso operation would, of course, bring forth
                            angry reactions. Just how angry, and just what concrete steps would
                            follow would depend to some extent on the manner in which the rejection
                            was announced. If done in such a way as to lead the Algerians to believe
                            they were being insulted or blackballed for political reasons, the
                            reaction could be fiery, at least in a verbal sense. And a rejection
                            would almost inevitably be ascribed to political motives. Other than the
                            Interests Section itself—which might be expelled if the Algerians felt
                            provoked enough—there are virtually no tangible US assets available for
                            the government to seize as reprisals. The several hundred American
                            specialists employed by SONATRACH might receive some personal
                            harassment, but being “unofficial” they are not likely to be expelled.
                            The Algerians would probably denounce the US in such organizations as
                            OPEC and throughout the Arab world. Radical oil producers in that area,
                            e,g., Iraq and Libya, would be sympathetic to Algerian complaints, but
                            rejection of the El Paso project would probably not in itself lead them
                            to take any new immediate anti-American steps.</p>
                        <p>40. Despite its pique with the US, we doubt that Algeria could or would
                            turn east and seek from the Russians what they could not get from the EL
                            Paso Natural Gas Company. They are almost certainly aware that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not need the gas,
                            probably could not soon produce the <gloss target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss>
                            tankers to ship it, and lacks the foreign exchange to pay for it. They
                            might take out their immediate resentment on the French. The ever wary
                            Algerians suspect Paris of plotting to kill the El Paso deal, both to
                            keep the Americans out of their sphere of influence and to punish the
                            Algerians for their recent anti-French acts. Though the great bulk of
                            French properties have already been taken over, there are still enough
                            French interests—e.g., their remaining 49 percent holdings in the oil
                            companies and their large export market in Algeria—to make them more
                            vulnerable than others to retaliatory actions. Whether the Algerians
                            would actually retaliate against the French is essentially
                            unpredictable, but would <pb n="15" xml:id="d27-15" facs="d27-15"
                            />depend, among other things, on whether the French might be prepared to
                            step in to take the gas originally intended for the US.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. The Longer Term Outlook: Algeria's Probable
                            Reliability as an Energy Supplier</p>
                        <p>41. If the El Paso contract is approved, it is to run for a period of 25
                            years. No one can posit with much certainty Algeria's—or most other
                            countries'—reliability as an energy producer over so long a period. We
                            list below those factors bearing on the problem which are most likely to
                            be of continuing relevance.</p>
                        <p>42. Incentives for the Algerians to continue shipments of gas to the US,
                            even in time of severe political stress, are strong, and likely to get
                            stronger over the years. Algeria needs the money, and as time passes it
                            will need it even more. Despite its oil revenues, it is not just another
                            rich Mideastern oil producer; it has 18 times the population of Kuwait,
                            while producing only a quarter to a third as much oil. Unlike Kuwait,
                            Libya, Abu Dhabi, and other wealthy Arab mini-states, Algeria has not
                            and cannot pile up huge foreign exchange reserves simply because it
                            lacks ways of usefully spending the money. From an economic point of
                            view, Algeria's situation is more like that of Iran; it is committed to
                            spending ever more on increasingly costly development schemes.(ll)As
                            projects get further along, it will become more and more difficult for
                            Algeria to do without the regular increment of funds needed to continue
                            them; it is easier to discard plans for a steel mill than to abandon it
                            three-quarters completed. This would almost certainly remain the case
                            even if the present or a future Algerian regime were to shift its
                            priorities from building heavy industry to promoting employment through
                            subsidized labor intensive industries; any economic plan aimed at
                            boosting living standards will require very substantial funding.</p>
                        <p>(11) Like Algeria, Iran has a fairly large population and promising
                            economic potential. Iran embarked an expensive economic development
                            program long before Algeria did. This is now well along, has so far been
                            successful but has become increasingly costly. Levels of exchange
                            reserves are low; indeed foreign indebtedness is increasing. Ever more
                            strongly committed to the program, the Iranian Government is both
                            endlessly wrangling for more money while showing great care not to bring
                            about even a temporary halt in income.</p>
                        <p>43. Further, natural gas is Algeria's real hope for greatly increased
                            revenues over the next several decades. Geological surveys to date
                            indicate that it will not be able to rival countries like Venezuela or
                            Saudi Arabia in volume of petroleum produced. But Algeria may very well
                            become the world's principal exporter of gas; over the longer term both
                            the amounts extracted and the revenues received may become very great
                            indeed. One of the important prerequisites for bringing this about is to
                            make the product attractive enough to generate a rising demand for it
                            and to attract the huge amounts of capital necessary to exploit it. Such
                            Algerians as Belaid Abdesselam (and very probably Boumediene) are well
                            aware that playing politics with gas sales is not the way to lure more
                            customers.</p>
                        <p>44. Rational economic interest is not, of course, necessarily going to be
                            the determinant of Algerian policy in all circumstances. We have
                            discussed above an element in Algerian thinking—the intense anti-Israeli
                            sentiments—which could motivate Algerian actions harming it as much or
                            more than the targets of its ire. Specifically, Algeria could, in the
                            heat of an Arab-Israeli crisis, ban the export of natural gas to the US.
                            (12)</p>
                        <p>(12) It might also do so in the heat of some other crisis situation,
                            e.g., another Algerian-Moroccan war if Morocco were backed by the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>45. Such a ban could have no great practical effect before 1975 at the
                            earliest. We cannot know who will be in charge then. An impetuous,
                            doctrinaire leader like BEN BELLA <pb n="16" xml:id="d27-16"
                                facs="d27-16"/>would be far more inclined to cut off shipments than
                            the more practical Boumediene. The degree of damage the Algerians
                            believed they could inflict on the US and El Paso by an embargo would
                            also be a factor. The very nature of the El Paso project is such that
                            there is almost nothing in that country owned by El Paso which the
                            government could seize, other than say office furniture and automobiles.
                            Nor with El Paso owning and controlling most if not all the <gloss
                                target="#t_LNG1">LNG</gloss> tankers, could the Algerian Government
                            arbitrarily divert gas shipments elsewhere. If it thought such an act
                            would impose real damage on the American economy, it might be more
                            inclined to take such a step than if it believed the US had alternative
                            sources of supply available or would suffer only minor
                            inconveniences.</p>
                        <p>46. To sum up, we cannot entirely rule out—in times of crisis—irrational,
                            impetuous acts by the Algerian Government against US economic interests
                            in general and the El Paso Natural Gas Company in particular. But even
                            if such moves were undertaken, they would be more likely than not to be
                            of short duration; economic incentives to resume would reassert
                            themselves once the political purposes of an embargo had been assured.
                            In general, however, the Algerians are likely to be a reliable
                            commercial partner if a deal is made. Indeed, because of small foreign
                            exchange reserves and probable increasing dependence on additional
                            revenues from gas sales, Algeria is less likely than most other Arab
                            producers of hydro-carbons to impose a long-term embargo on the
                            US.(13)</p>
                        <p>(13) By 1975, Libya will have exchange reserves so large (perhaps $5
                            billion or more) that it could shut down all oil production and live on
                            the interest it would draw. Algeria cannot, for decades at least, hope
                            to be in a comparable position.</p>

                        <p>2. DURING 1971 US/ALGERIAN RELATIONS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE AS COMMERCIAL,
                            FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL LINKS GREW, AMERICAN VISITORS WERE RECEIVED
                            AT HIGH LEVELS AND DOORS OPENED TO AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN AND OFFICIALS.

                        <p>3. SEPTEMBER CAME AND WENT AND ALGERIAN OFFICIALS WERE TOLD FPC DECISION
                            WOULD BE DELAYED. THEY ASSUMED THIS MEANT TILL LATE 1971 OR EARLY 1972.
                            NOW, NO ONE HERE MENTIONS DATES AND VOICES GROW WEARY WHEN EL PASO IS
                            MENTIONED.</p>
                        <p>4. PRESIDENT BOUMEDIENE CLAIMS THERE IS NO HURRY RE EL PASO “SINCE IT IS
                            NOT IN FOUR-YEAR PLAN (“1970-74”). AT SAME TIME HE HAS LET US KNOW THAT
                            THROUGH EL PASO PROJECT HE “EXTENDED HAND TO AMERICANS AND IS WAITING
                            FOR THEM TO GRASP IT.”</p>
                        <p>5. FACT THAT BOUMEDIENE IS RESERVING HIS JUDGMENT SEEMS TO HAVE FILTERED
                            DOWN TO SOME ALGERIAN OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOW MORE CAUTIOUS THAN BEFORE IN
                            THEIR DEALINGS WITH U.S. OFFICIALS. NEVERTHELESS, US/ALGERIAN ECONOMIC
                            RELATIONS CONTINUE TO PROSPER AS WITH SONATRACH'S NEW CONTRACTS WITH
                            CORCO AND ESSO. POSITION OF USINT HAS ALSO IMPROVED. WE NOW HAVE GOOD
                            ACCESS TO ALGERIAN OFFICIALS AS OTHER EMBASSIES AND CHIEF USINT IS ON
                            FONMINISTER'S INVITATION LIST FOR OFFICIAL DINNERS.</p>
                        <p>6. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT ALGERIAN LEADERSHIP HAS SECOND THOUGHTS RE
                            THEIR STATED DESIRE TO BUILD A LONG-TERM MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL
                            RELATIONSHIP. FURTHERMORE, IN SPITE OF HOSTILE ATTITUDE OF ALGERIAN
                            MEDIA, GOA HAS AS A CONSCIOUS POLICY TRIED TO INSULATE BILATERAL
                            US/ALGERIAN RELATIONS FROM MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS AND POLITICAL
                            DIFFERENCES ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.</p>
                        <p>7. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR SATISFACTION, OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
                            ALGERIA IS STILL FRAGILE AND REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION. IF FORWARD
                            MOVEMENT ON EL PASO PROJECT DOES NOT COME SOON THERE IS NO DANGER THAT,
                            IN ABSENCE OF OTHER GESTURES, BOUMEDIENE MIGHT BECOME DISILLUSIONED AND
                            PULL BACK. HOWEVER, WE CAN PROBABLY SAFELY MARK TIME FOR ANOTHER MONTH
                            OR TWO.</p>
                        <p>8. WHEN EL PASO PROJECT CLEARS <gloss target="#t_FPC1">FPC</gloss> THERE
                            SHOULD BE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN ATMOSPHERE AND OPENINGS TOWARD NEW GAS AND

                            <item>Air Defense Network for Algeria</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Algerians have approached Raytheon about purchasing an air defense
                            communications network. For Raytheon to do this would involve items from
                            the Munitions Control List for which Algeria is ineligible according to
                            present policy—not by law—because it does not have diplomatic relations
                            with the US. The question is whether we would accept Algeria from the
                            ban for this project. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> recommends we do so, but seeks your concurrence
                            (attached).</p>
                        <p>What is involved is a $60-$80 million air defense network, essentially a
                            radar system for all purposes including military. It is not an offensive
                            system and no weapons would be involved—although obviously the net
                            effect would be to improve Algeria's defense capability. The British,
                            French and Italians are also interested.</p>
                        <p>The immediate operational question stems from the fact that the sale
                            would have to include items from the Munitions List. Raytheon does not
                            want to go ahead and prepare an offer without an understanding that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to exempt Algeria
                            from the ban in this case. There is no legal inhibition; this would be
                            strictly a policy decision. Raytheon will also need financing, but State
                            has discouraged them from thinking about any <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> assistance which is prohibited by law.</p>
                        <p>The broader issue is whether we want to take another step towards
                            developing a presence outside the framework of formal political ties in
                            the Mid East.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Arguments</p>
                        <p>On the pro side, such a project would give us the first contact with the
                            Algerian military since the 1967 break in relations and would dilute the
                            Soviet position as the sole supplier of the Algerian air force. There
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d29-02" facs="d29-02"/>would be advantage in a
                            pragmatic broadening of our relationship with an important Arab state
                            and no significant impact on the Arab-Israeli military balance because
                            Algeria is so far from an active Arab-Israeli military front. Also among
                            the advantages are the gain to US industry and the further broadening of
                            the American technological and commercial presence in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there is the argument that we do not see eye-to-eye on
                            issues like Vietnam—although they have been helpful on the prisoner
                            question—or the Palestine question. There is also the fact that
                            Americans would be involved in helping Algeria strengthen its military
                            defenses—with some effect on our friends in Tunisia and Morocco. The
                            Secretary would propose briefing the Israelis at an appropriate time,
                            putting it in the perspective that it is in our mutual interests to have
                            an entree to the Algerian military and some leverage on the Soviet
                            position there.</p>
                        <p>On balance, it seems to me that the US has an interest in developing a
                            presence in the area which can supplement inter-governmental relations
                            when they are at low ebb as now. In this connection, we have encouraged
                            the private sector to look for opportunities. Raytheon's opportunity is
                            one such case. Algeria is potentially one of the leaders of that area,
                            and we have encouraged increasing—albeit commercial—ties with it.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That no objection be posed to Raytheon's bidding on this
                            project and that State Department be authorized to provide necessary
                            munitions export licenses.</p>

                            long-standing invitation to visit Algeria later this month. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> (Tab B) recommends
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> carry a letter from

                            letter (Tab A) expresses your satisfaction in the growing contacts
                            between Algeria and the US, notes that it is in our common interests to
                            continue this trend and concludes with the general observation that this
                            complements our efforts toward better understanding among nations around
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>Algerian-US relations have developed over the last few years primarily
                            through substantial commercial exchange. While the Algerians have not
                            abandoned their philosophical positions on such issues as the
                            Palestinian revolution and Vietnam, Boumediene's pragmatic interest in
                            developing Algeria has made possible a foundation for relating to the US
                            in areas—primarily economic—matching Algeria's needs. Out of this and
                            despite political differences has grown a series of relationships over
                            the last two years. Astronaut FRANK BORMAN's visit was one highlight;
                            you and President <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName> have
                            exchanged various greetings; and you have sent your foreign policy
                            report to him. A letter from you carried by <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> would appropriately fit in the context of this
                            already existing—albeit limited—series of exchanges.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: That you sign the letter to President <persName

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of his visit to Algeria, I have asked Assistant Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to convey to you
                            my best personal wishes and my feeling of satisfaction with the
                            favorable trend in relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Those relations rest on a firm foundation of interests common to Algeria
                            and to the United States. For this reason, they hold the promise of
                            substantial benefits for both the Algerian and American people. I
                            believe our governments have shown what can be done to promote
                            advantageous cooperation and contacts despite differences in social
                            systems and policies.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United States is also engaged in major efforts to
                            encourage understanding and cooperation in other areas of the world.

                            EXPLAINING DELAY IN POUCH, AND EMPHASIZING KEEN INTEREST BOTH PRESIDENT
                            AND SECRETARY OF STATE IN RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA. PRESIDENT ACCEPTED

                        <p>4. IN OPENING REMARKS, I STRESSED U.S. SEARCH FOR NEW PATHS TO PEACE,
                            MINIMIZING DIFFERENCES AND SEEKING BASIS FOR FRIENDSHIP FOUNDED ON
                            MUTUAL INTEREST AND RESPECT. I EMPHASIZED NO NATION CAN CHANGE COURSE
                            WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PAST OBLIGATIONS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. WE
                            WOULD, THEREFORE, CONTINUE OUR PRESENCE IN EUROPE AND MEDITERRANEAN,
                            UNTIL THERE IS CLEAR PROGRESS IN WORLD SECURITY AND DISARMAMENT,
                            REMAINING WILLING AT SAME TIME DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS WORLD SECURITY
                            PROBLEMS. WITH ISRAEL AND AFRICAN PROBLEMS IN MIND, I STRESSED
                            LIMITATIONS ON U.S. INFLUENCE ON BASIC POLICIES OTHER NATIONS,
                            PARTICULARLY WHEN THEIR OWN VITAL INTERESTS INVOLVED. FINALLY, NOTING
                            DEBATE IN U.S. ON NATIONAL PRIORITIES, I ASSURED PRESIDENT U.S. WOULD
                            CONTINUE PLAY VITAL ROLE IN WORLD, EMPHASIZING PARTICULARLY, AND
                            INCREASINGLY, ECONOMIC ASPECTS.</p>
                        <p>5. EMPHASIZING PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>'S
                            ERA OF NEGOTIATIONS AND SEARCH FOR GENERATION OF PEACE, I OUTLINED
                            CURRENT POLICIES WITH RESPECT VIET NAM, MIDDLE EAST, SOVIET UNION, AND
                            CHINA. ON VIET NAM, I STRESSED UNWILLINGNESS NORTH VIET NAM AND VIET
                            CONG GENUINELY TO NEGOTIATE, DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL PROOF OF OUR DESIRE FOR
                            SETTLEMENT. PRISONER ISSUE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE, BUT WE WOULD NOT WALK
                            AWAY FROM AND DEPOSE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT; WE BELIEVED PEOPLE OF
                            SOUTH SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITY GENUINELY TO EXPRESS THEIR OWN WILL. ON
                            MIDDLE EAST, U.S. HAD SHOWN RESTRAINT, SOUGHT PEACE, RECOGNIZED
                            IMPORTANCE OF PALESTINIANS, BUT ARAB RESPONSE TO U.S. EFFORTS HAD BEEN
                            DISAPPOINTING. RELATIONS WITH SOVIET UNION, IN ANTICIPATION OF VISIT,
                            WERE POSITIVE WITH SALT TALKS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. ON CHINA, I READ
                            PRESIDENT VERSION IN FRENCH OF BRIEFING ON VISIT.</p>
                        <p>6. ON BILATERAL PLANE, I STRESSED GROWING MUTUAL INTEREST WHICH BALANCES
                            U.S. NEEDS FOR ENERGY AND WITH ALGERIAN REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICIANS,
                            CAPITAL, AND MARKETS. RECOGNIZING WHAT ALGERIA HAS DONE IN SETTLTNG

                            SEVERAL ISSUES, I STRESSED U.S. HAD ALSO TAKEN SIGNIFICANT AND UNUSUAL
                            STEPS TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC RELATIONS; ENCOURAGING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
                            AND TECHNICIANS; PROVIDING CCC CREDITS FOR WHEAT; POSITIVE ATTITUDE ON

                            LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ALGERIA, BUT FROM INTERNAL QUESTIONS FLOWING

                            SECRETARY, I EXPRESSED STRONG HOPE IN WASHINGTON THAT NEW U.S.
                            INITIATIVES IN INTERNATIONAL FIELD AND GROWING ECONOMIC RELATIONS MIGHT
                            SOON PROVIDE BASIS FOR RESUMPTION NORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.</p>

                            ON VIET NAM HE RECALLED HE HAD TOLD VISITING AMERICANS IN 1966 THEY WERE
                            ON WRONG TRACK IN SEEING VIET NAM AS PROBLEM WITH COMMUNISTS RATHER THAN
                            AS NATIONALISTIC STRUGGLE. AT SAME TIME IN CONTACTS WITH NVN, HE HAD
                            STRESSED THAT U.S., AS MAJOR POWER, MUST BE GIVEN CHANCE WITHDRAW
                            GRACEFULLY. RECOUNTING ALGERIAN EXPERIENCE, HE SAID NO NATIONALIST WILL
                            TRUST ELECTIONS WHILE TROOPS OF “IMPERIALIST” POWER REMAIN IN COUNTRY.
                            AT SAME TIME, ALGERIANS GAVE FRANCE MANY CONCESSIONS TO PERMIT THEIR
                            DEPARTURE. VIETNAMESE SHOULD DETERMINE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT SEE
                            ANY EARLY UNION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH.</p>

                        <p>9. WHEN I REITERATED FLEXIBILITY OUR RESPONSE, FEELING THAT NORTH VIET
                            NAM NOT PREPARED NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH, AND IMPORTANCE PRISONER ISSUE,
                            HE REPLIED HE HAD DISCUSSED PRISONER ISSUE WITH NVN. THEY CANNOT GIVE
                            WAY ON THAT SINCE IT IS “THEIR ONLY CARD” TO BRING ABOUT U.S. WITHDRAWAL
                            BOTH OF TROOPS AND SUPPORT FOR THIEU. THEN HE ASKED: “WOULD WE ACCEPT
                            ANY GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH VIET NAM?” I REPLIED WE HAD PROPOSED
                            INTERNATIONALLY SUPERVISED ELECTIONS AND WE WERE PREPARED ACCEPT ANY
                            GOVERNMENT SOUTH VIETNAMESE CHOOSE IN SUCH ELECTION. I REITERATED OUR
                            DESIRE FOR GENUINE NEGOTIATIONS, SUCH AS ALGERIANS HAD FINALLY HAD WITH
                            FRENCH.</p>

                            ALGERIA WAS “EQUIDISTANT” BETWEEN CHINA, RUSSIA AND AMERICA AND WOULD
                            REMAIN THAT WAY. WHEN ALL THREE CAN WATCH MOON LANDING TOGETHER, THERE
                            MUST BE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM. HE WELCOMED PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO
                            MOSCOW IN SAME VEIN. HE HAD NO SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO MOSCOW AND HAD TOLD
                            KOSYGIN DURING LAST VISIT THAT HE (<persName corresp="#p_BH1"

                            SPEECH FOR MIDDLE EAST, ASKING FOUR RHETORICAL QUESTIONS: (1) ARE THERE
                            ARAB LANDS OCCUPIED?; (2) ARE THERE OR ARE THERE NOT PALESTINE PEOPLE IN
                            EXILE?; (3) DOES THIS SITUATION CONSTITUTE THREAT TO PEACE?; (4) IS IT
                            IN INTEREST OF U.S. TO REMAIN SEEN IN ARAB WORLD AS SOLE SUPPORT OF
                            ISRAEL? ISRAEL HAS WON FIGHT AND WILL STAY SO LONG AS U.S. SUPPORTS IT
                            TECHNOLOGICALLY, BUT ARABS WILL NOT GIVE UP. U.S. WITH INTEREST IN
                            ENERGY, CANNOT AFFORD IGNORE FACT ARABS CONTROL MAJOR SOURCES OF ENERGY.
                            ALGERIAN SOLUTION IS PALESTINE IN WHICH JEWS AND ARABS COEXIST; ANY
                            OTHER SOLUTION IS MERELY PROLONGED ARMISTICE. <persName corresp="#p_BH1"

                            ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHEN U.S. TOOK 20 MILLION CUBIC METERS OF ALGERIAN
                            GAS, THERE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL RECIPROCITY IN EXPORTS. WHEN I EXPRESSED
                            DESIRE RETURN TO WASHINGTON WITH CLEAR IDEA OF HOW HE SAW CIRCUMSTANCES
                            FOR POSSIBLE RESUMPTION. HE REPLIED: “LOOK AT MY POSITION. SYRIA, EGYPT,
                            AND SUDAN BROKE AT SAME TIME AS ALGERIA. HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT TO THEM IF
                            I RESUME NOW?” HE AGREED RESUMPTION WAS NOT MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, BUT
                            MATTER OF TIME. HE AGREED WHEN I INTERPRETED HIS REMARKS TO MEAN THAT
                            WHILE MIDDLE EAST REMAINED IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION, HE DID NOT EXCLUDE
                            POSSIBILITY FINDING WHOLLY BILATERAL AND ECONOMIC BASIS FOR RESUMPTION
                            ONCE PRESENT ECONOMIC PROJECTS (PRIMARILY GAS) WERE APPROVED. HE
                            MENTIONED RESUMPTION WITH WEST GERMANY, WHO HAD TAKEN YEAR TO REPLY TO
                            ALGERIAN OVERTURE. I TOLD HIM AS FAR AS U.S. WAS CONCERNED, BALL IN HIS
                            COURT. WE HAD DONE MANY EXCEPTIONAL THINGS FOR ALGERIA. WE FORESAW
                            ADVANTAGES TO BOTH IN HAVING FLAGS FLYING IN RESPECTIVE CAPITALS. WE
                            CONSIDERED NEXT MOVE UP TO THEM. HE ASKED IF THIS MEANT CRITICISM OF
                            ALGERIAN POSITION. I REPLIED IT WAS MERE STATEMENT OF FACT. HE
                            AGREED.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_HS1">HAMDANI</persName> REPLIED THAT THIS WAS
                            IMPORTANT MATTER WHICH WOULD BE GIVEN SERIOUS STUDY. BOUTEFLIKA WOULD BE
                            RETURNING ALGIERS LATE TODAY OR TOMORROW (IMPLYING THAT WE WOULD NOT
                            HAVE REPLY FOR SEVERAL DAYS). HIS ONLY QUESTION WAS FOR CLARIFICATION
                            WHETHER WE WERE CLEARLY LINKING SECRETARY'S PROPOSED VISIT WITH
                            RESUMPTION DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. I REPLIED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE SINCE WHATEVER OTHER REASONS THERE
                            MIGHT BE FOR SECRETARY TO VISIT ALGIERS, IT WOULD BE ASSUMED,
                            PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING RENEWAL WITH YEMEN, THAT A MAJOR PURPOSE OF VISIT
                            WOULD BE RESUMPTION DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THEREFORE, FAILURE TO DO SO
                            COULD BE INTERPRETED AS SETBACK IN RELATIONS.</p>

                            CONDITIONS AND ADVANTAGES OF SEIZING MOMENT FOR RAPID ACTION. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HS1">HAMDANI</persName> NODDED BUT ADDED THAT WHATEVER
                            DECISION AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME (MEANING POSSISLE NEGATIVE DECISION) IT
                            WOULD NOT FORECLOSE ACTION IN FUTURE.</p>

                        <p>6. COMMENT: BELIEVE ALGERIANS WILL GIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO PROPOSAL
                            BUT SUSPECT CURRENT ODDS ARE AGAINST RENEWAL. FAVORABLE FPC DECISION RE
                            EL PASO WAS MAJOR FACTOR WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO RESUMPTION
                            RELATIONS. RENEWAL WITH YEMEN IS ALSO HELPFUL IN LONG RUN THOUGH
                            ALGERIANS WOULD NOT WANT ANY DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT RENEWAL AND
                            THEIR OWN, AND HENCE IT MIGHT WEIGH AGAINST IMMEDIATE ALGERIAN RENEWAL.
                            MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ALGERIANS, WHO ARE EVER MINDFUL OF THEIR REPUTATION IN
                            THIRD WORLD, WILL BE CURRENT HEIGHTENED MILITARY ACTIVITY IN INDOCHINA.
                            IDEAL TIMING FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW WOULD PROBABLY BE A FEW MONTHS
                            HENCE WHEN EL PASO PROJECT IS UNDERWAY AND WHEN MILITARY ACTIVITY IN
                            INDOCHINA MIGHT HAVE BEEN REDUCED. I MENTIONED TO HAMDANI THAT ASSTSEC
                            NEWSOM WAS PREPARED TO COME TO ALGERIA. <persName corresp="#p_HS1"
                                >HAMDANI</persName> DID NOT GIVE DIRECT REPLY, BUT I BELIEVE FROM
                            WHAT HE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT HE WOULD NOT WANT TO RISK “FAILURE” OF SUCH
                            A MISSION AND THEREFORE WOULD WANT IT ONLY IF DECISION TO RENEW
                            RELATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE. IN SUCH CASE, I BELIEVE NEWSOM'S VISIT
                            TO ALGERIA JUST BEFORE AND DURING SECRETARY'S VISIT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN
                            PROVIDING LATEST WASHINGTON IMPRESSIONS FOR BILATERAL TALKS.</p>

                                avoid imprisonment for an assault conviction, Eldridge Cleaver,
                                Minister of Information for the Black Panthers, founded a
                                headquarters in Algeria. On June 3, two Black Panthers had demanded
                                and received $500,000 in ransom after hijacking a Western Airlines
                                flight, a sum which the government of Algeria returned to the
                                airline. The Government then released the hijackers to the Black
                                Panthers in Algiers.</note>

                            about this new and extremely serious incident. He wanted to say - first
                            of all, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not wish to
                            negotiate with Algeria on this subject. It was obvious that we had no
                            control over the aircraft which was presently en route from Miami to
                            Boston; it's ultimate destination presumably being Algiers. The
                            passengers had been let off, $1 million ransom collected. There were
                            three men, two women and three children involved in the hijacking
                            group.</p>
                        <p>We did not intend to ask Algeria any question on what would be done if
                            the plane landed in Algeria. We felt that if there is any responsibility
                            anywhere it lies in the fact that Algeria did give asylum to the
                            previous hijackers—a fact which was widely circulated by the press—and a
                            statement <pb n="2" xml:id="d33-02" facs="d33-02"/>was recently issued
                            by the Panthers HQ in Algiers, and picked up by the US press, containing
                            encouragement to carry out similar acts.</p>
                        <p>There can be no question about Algerian responsibility concerning the
                            life of the crew and the safety of the aircraft. This is clearly a
                            national responsibility under the terms of the Chicago convention which
                            Algeria has signed.</p>
                        <p>Speaking now as a friend, continued Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, and one who has served and worked hard and long
                            to improve relations between the US and Algeria, he could not
                            over-emphasize the seriousness with which this second incident is viewed
                            at the highest level of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> nor the
                            effect that its outcome will have on the progress of our relations.</p>
                        <p>We have to consider—many people in this country will indeed feel this
                            way—that encouragements are being given to commit similar acts and that
                            this constitutes a direct intervention into the domestic affairs of the
                            U.S. No country is more conscious than Algeria of what intervention into
                            one's domestic affairs means.</p>
                        <p>We were not suggesting any conditions nor directing requests at GOA but
                            the steps that one might normally expect to be taken by any government
                            were clear. <pb n="3" xml:id="d33-03" facs="d33-03"/>Such steps would be
                            liberation of the plane and its crew, immediate return of the $1
                            million, action against the hijackers which unlike the previous case
                            would signify to them that they were not welcome, would not receive
                            asylum and would be dealt with in conformity with the crime they had
                            committed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> then repeated that he
                            did not feel useful or proper to engage in a discussion of what steps
                            might be taken, Algeria might be able to handle the situation while
                            still able to meet some of its own problems. It might for instance let
                            the hijackers off, then take them into custody and if it did not want to
                            treat with them directly could send them on to a third country. It might
                            allow the plane to land but only to refuel and proceed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not intend to embarrass or
                            pressure GOA but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            must be aware that Algerians have created a very, very grave situation
                            for us. In the eyes of many US officials the statement issued from
                            Algiers constitutes an encouragement to perpetrate such acts in the
                            future, this endangers civil aviation users and the resulting situation
                            can only be termed intolerable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rein pointed out that the measures Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> alluded to were not the result of any bilateral
                            obligation of GOA but rather were the sort of measures that Algeria <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="d33-04" facs="d33-04"/>might want to take under its
                            Chicago convention and ICAO memberships. It was not something that was
                            owed to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> by Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> responded that
                            normally he would just express his thanks and hurry back to his office
                            to transmit Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>'s comments
                            to his government but he felt constrained to remark on some of the
                            points made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> which
                            had come as a painful surprise to him. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> had said that GOA encourages hijacking. He did
                            not think that his government encouraged these acts in one way or the
                            other. GOA's behavior in previous cases had consistently been to
                            participate in the saving of the lives of the crew and the aircraft
                            involved. GOA does not intend to encourage hijacking throughout the
                            world or interference in US domestic affairs. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> must surely know this being an
                            expert and the officer responsible for relations between the US and
                            Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> had quoted a
                            statement that was unknown to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName>, he was sure GOA was unaware of it also. It
                            was a statement made by an irresponsible person and Algeria could not be
                            made to assume responsibility for it. How could anyone pretend to SPEAK
                            for GOA and pretend to make such appeals in its name. He wished to
                            denounce this statement as a falsehood if it had been made in the name
                            of GOA. He attached absolutely no value to it and rejected the
                            responsibility of its author.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d33-05" facs="d33-05"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> pointed out that he had
                            suggested that GOA bore a measure of responsibility because at the time
                            of the first incident we had stated that unless GOA took legal measures
                            against the hijackers this would only serve to encourage future
                            incidents. Instead the Panthers had publicly announced two weeks ago the
                            granting of asylum and the international Panthers HQ located in Algiers
                            in facilities supplied to them by the Algerian Party Organization had
                            thanked GOA for the considerate and comradely attitude shown in this
                            case and had stated that it would seek to carry out other acts of
                            expropriation against the US.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> recalled that we had
                            raised the question of asylum granted to the Panthers HQ only once when
                            they had an article in NYT advocating the assassination of the
                            President. Following our demarche GOA had then placed some restrictions
                            upon them. Obviously the Panthers HQ is in a country which has control
                            over what goes on in its territory. The two hijackers had been turned
                            over to the Panthers organization and that organization's statement must
                            obviously have had the encouragement or even clearance of GOA. It is
                            very hard indeed to think the GOA does not bear some responsibility. Mr.
                            Newsom invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> to
                            consider that if a New York-based group advocating the overthrow of the
                            GOA was receiving exiles from Algeria, who at gunpoint had <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="d33-06" facs="d33-06"/>extorted $1 million and then
                            proceeded from Algeria to New York then he, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>, would be sitting where Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> was sitting now making
                            very sharp representations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> responded that the
                            relation between our two countries go back many years, have gone through
                            difficult times but the difficulties have always been overcome by calm
                            and equanimity. The recent hijacking case had been solved in this spirit
                            in spite of the complications brought by the world wide campaign of
                            threats of boycott against Algeria, going as far as the Security
                            Council. In this case again, Algeria had not asked for this airplane to
                            be diverted towards its territory; he would check very closely into the
                            situation and hope that it would have a normal outcome. GOA would do
                            everything to insure the safety of the crew and aircraft. He wished to
                            assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> on this point
                            without even awaiting instructions from his government. As for the rest,
                            he urged Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> to trust in
                            the good relations and the climate existing with his country, he was
                            sure that the same procedure based upon good will would obtain in this
                            present case. He stressed the need to allow GOA to act in a calm
                            atmosphere, not in a climate of artificial tempest, under pressure and
                            threat. He expressed his thanks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> and reiterated the esteem of his leaders for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and all the efforts he
                            has made which are highly appreciated. He urged Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> not to allow his work to be
                            placed in jeopardy <pb n="7" xml:id="d33-07" facs="d33-07"/>by a
                            situation which Algeria had not sought and which the US had not wished
                            but of which both were the victims. He stressed that at times it is more
                            difficult to guide one's friends than one's foes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stressed that he
                            understood fully Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>'s
                            position but we in the Department do not determine what the public
                            reaction will be or how airline pilots will react. We did not try to
                            stimulate such a reaction last time; we will not this time. The problem
                            remains with us; it grows more serious each time.</p>
                        <p>Speaking as a friend and not as a part of his official demarche he wanted
                            to stress the importance of mutual confidence in the fabric of the
                            relationship we are trying to build between our two countries. If he
                            were to repeat to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            some of the language used at the time of the previous hijacking and some
                            of the views held now at the highest level of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName>
                            would be shocked.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> continued that however
                            hard we may strive to detach events for which neither of us bear any
                            responsibility from the general state of our relations we will not
                            succeed because in the view of many <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            officials there is only one country which so far has not fully
                            cooperated in hijacking problems, at the time when such problems aroused
                            world-wide concern and that country is Algeria and this per force puts
                            Algeria in a very <pb n="8" xml:id="d33-08" facs="d33-08"/>special
                            category. It also complicates our task of maintaining confidence in
                            Algeria and in her respects of international committments. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> concluded that he would do the
                            utmost so that all concerned would give GOA some more time to work
                            things out if the plane did indeed land in Algeria. It was his personal
                            view that at some point Algeria must make a choice between the
                            responsible image that it wants to have, that we want Algeria to have
                            also and the benefits it derives from sheltering exiles and permitting
                            such exiles to encourage the perpetration of criminal acts seemingly
                            with Algeria's support or acquiescence.</p>

                        <p>2. SUMMARY: IN COURSE OF TWO HOUR DISCUSSION, SECRETARY EXPRESSED
                            PLEASURE AT IMPROVING US-ALGERIAN RELATIONS, AND OUTLINED US POSITION ON
                            ME PROBLEMS, TERRORISM, AND HIJACKING. BOUTEFLIKA RESPONDED WITH
                            RESTATEMENT OF GOA POSITION ON PALESTINE PROBLEMS AND ME QUESTIONS, AND
                            SAID, REGARDING TERRORISM AND HIJACKING, THAT GOA MAKES A DISTINCTION
                            BETWEEN BANDITRY AND THE ACTIONS OF NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. END
                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>3. THE SECRETARY WELCOMED <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >BOUTEFLIKA</persName> AND SAID HE HOPED OUR RELATIONS COULD
                            CONTINUE TO IMPROVE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS. SECRETARY
                            SAID HE WAS GLAD THAT EL PASO/SONATRACH CONTRACT WAS GOING WELL.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> REPLIED THAT
                            POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARE NOT PERMANENT, IN SPITE OF THEIR COMPLEXITY. HE
                            DID NOT BELIEVE THAT EVENTUAL SOLUTIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE, NOR DID HE
                            CONSIDER PARTICULAR SOLUTIONS AS PRE-CONDITIONS FOR THE <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d34-02" facs="d34-02"/>RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
                            BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. WHAT WE AGREED UPON THE LAST TIME WE MET WAS
                            TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER EVEN MORE CLOSELY THAN IF WE HAD DIPLOMATIC
                            RELATIONS. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> EXPRESSED
                            HIS GRATITUDE FOR EVERYTHING SECRETARY HAD DONE PERSONALLY TO INCREASE
                            NUMBER OF PROJECTS OF COMMON INTEREST TO U.S. AND ALGERIA.</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY REPLIED WE HAVE MANAGED TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONS WITH
                            PRACTICALLY ALL NATIONS. WE HOPE ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN ALGERIA AND
                            THE U.S. CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. BOTH HE AND ASST SECRETARY <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN TO
                            ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO BE ACTIVE IN ALGERIA, AND HOPE THAT FOLLOWING
                            TODAY'S MEETING, ADDITIONAL PROGRESS WILL BE MADE.</p>
                        <p>6. SECRETARY SAID U.S. WANTS TO CARRY OUT POLICY OF IMPROVED RELATIONS
                            WITH ARAB COUNTRIES, BECAUSE SUCH A POLICY IS IN OUR INTEREST. THERE IS
                            NO REASON WHY THOSE RELATIONS CANNOT IMPROVE, IN SPITE OF SERIOUS
                            PROBLEMS THAT REMAIN IN MIDDLE EAST. THE ARABS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM
                            U.S., U.S. HAS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVES AND DOES NOT WISH TO INTERFERE IN
                            THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. ONLY ME PROBLEM REMAINS. WE HOPE TO PLAY HELPFUL
                            ROLE BUT ARAB WORLD DOES NOT SPEAK WITH SINGLE VOICE, AND THIS MAKES IT
                            DIFFICULT TO MOVE AHEAD. WE HOPE AT SOME POINT THERE IS GOING TO BE A
                            WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE DISCUSSION ON THE PART OF ALL THE
                            PARTIES CONCERNED. SUCH DISCUSSIONS DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE FACE
                            TO FACE, BUT AN ACTIVE DIALOGUE AMONG NATIONS IS NEEDED TO SEE WHAT CAN
                            BE DONE IN MATTER OF ACCOMMODATIONS. DISCUSSIONS CAN LEAD TO INTERIM
                            AGREEMENT, WHICH WILL BE A FIRST STEP TOWARD A FINAL SOLUTION. WE SEE NO
                            ALTERNATIVES; TO HAVE PROGRESS THERE MUST BE A COMMITMENT TO START
                            DISCUSSIONS WITH A VIEW TO COMPLIANCE WITH RESOLUTION 242. WE ALSO
                            RECOGNIZE NEED FOR SOLUTION TO PROBLEM OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.</p>
                        <p>7. REGARDING TERRORISM, THE SECRETARY SAID THAT WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT
                            ACTS SUCH AS BLOWING UP PLANES, BOMBS THROUGH THE MAIL AND THE KIDNAPING
                            OF DIPLOMATS, MAY APPEAR JUSTIFIED IN THE MINDS OF THOSE COMMITTING
                            THEM, AS THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE SERVING A GOOD CAUSE, WE FEEL THAT SUCH
                            ACTS SET CAUSE BACK. ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST INNOCENT PEOPLE CANNOT BE
                            ADMITTED BY CIVILIZED PERSONS. WE ARE NOT SPEAKING OF LIBERATION
                            MOVEMENTS OR THE PALESTINE PROBLEM, BUT OF AVIATION. NO CAUSE, NO MATTER
                            HOW JUST, CAN JUSTIFY BLOWING UP OR HIJACKING A <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d34-03" facs="d34-03"/>PLANE. <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> APPRECIATES RETURN OF PLANES, CREW AND MONEY (IN THE
                            WESTERN AND DELTA CASES), AND HOPES THAT IF GOA CANNOT EXTRADITE IT CAN
                            AT LEAST PROSECUTE THE HIJACKERS. IF GOA PROVIDES A SAFEHAVEN, OTHERS
                            WILL BE ENCOURAGED AND WE AND OUR CHILDREN WILL FACE DANGER OF BEING
                            BLOWN UP. ALGERIA HAS A MODERATE AND REASONABLE GOVERNMENT AND IS
                            ATTRACTIVE TO AMERICAN INVESTMENT, BUT HIJACKING INCIDENTS HAVE DAMAGED
                            ALGERIA'S IMAGE.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> REPLIED THAT USG IS
                            TOO COMMITTED TO ISRAEL. IF US CONTINUES PRESENT POLICY, ITS INTERESTS
                            IN ARAB WORLD ARE DOOMED. HE URGED THAT IN WAKE OF SOVIET WITHDRAWAL
                            FROM EGYPT, US REVISE ITS POLICY.</p>
                        <p>9. IN COURSE FULL DISCUSSION OF PALESTINE PROBLEM, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> RESTATED GOA POSITION THAT
                            KEY TO ME SETTLEMENT IS JUSTICE FOR PALESTINIANS. PALESTINIANS ARE
                            HOMELESS AND DESPERATE. ONE SHOULD NOT JUDGE THEM TOO HARSHLY. IT IS
                            ISRAEL, NOT THE ARAB STATES, THAT HAS BLOCKED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
                            ROGERS PLAN, THE JARRING MEMO OF FEB 8, AND EFFORTS OF THE BIG FOUR.
                            ALGERIA WILL NOT HINDER ANY PEACE INITIATIVE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH
                            JUSTICE.</p>
                        <p>10. CONCERNING TERRORISM AND HIJACKING, BOUTEFLIKA RECALLED THAT ALGERIA
                            HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROBLEM. FRENCH HAD HIJACKED A
                            PLANE CARRYING ALGERIAN LEADERS DURING ALGERIAN REVOLUTION AND ISRAELI
                            PLANE HAD BEEN HIJACKED BY PALESTINIANS TO ALGERIA. IN LATTER CASE, BOTH
                            ISRAELI CREW AND PASSENGERS HAD BEEN RELEASED AND SOME PALESTINIANS
                            FREED. GOA RECOGNIZES THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT THERE IS A
                            DISTINCTION BETWEEN NATIONAL LIBERATION AND BANDITRY. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> REFERRED TO PREVIOUS GOA
                            SUGGESTION THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> SEND GOA A DOCUMENT
                            ASKING IT NOT TO PERMIT HIJACKED AIRCRAFT TO LAND AND SECRETARY REPLIED
                            THAT THIS WOULD CREATE OTHER PROBLEMS CONCERNING SAFETY OF AIRCRAFT CREW
                            AND PASSENGERS. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> SAID
                            GOA DOES NOT WANT TO BECOME HAVEN FOR CRIMINALS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT NOT
                            TO MAKE MARTYRS OF THE HIJACKERS. (BOUTEFLIKA APPEARED UNAWARE THAT TWO
                            OF HIJACKERS IN DELTA CASE WERE ESCAPED CONVICTS). HE SAID US AND GOA
                            SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER REGARDING COMMON CRIMINALS.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> SAID GOA WOULD
                            JEALOUSLY GUARD ITS OWN NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND WOULD SUPPORT NATIONAL
                            LIBERATION MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLES DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTS BY COLONIAL
                            POWERS. THIS INCLUDES SUPPORT OF LIBERATION <pb n="4" xml:id="d34-04"
                                facs="d34-04"/>MOVEMENTS IN PORTUGUESE AFRICA, SOUTH AFRICA AND
                            RHODESIA, BUT NOT MOROCCO, WHERE GOA CONSIDERED KING <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName> WAS LEGITIMATE RULER. BOUTEFLIKA
                            SAID GOA IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS RELATIONS WITH U.S. AND ADDED
                            THAT BLACK PANTHERS DO NOT MAKE ANY EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO ALGERIA
                            FROM REVOLUTIONARY, IDEOLOGICAL OR MORAL STANDPOINT.</p>
                        <p>12. IN CLOSING, SECRETARY EXPRESSED REGRET FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY HAVE
                            OCCURRED TO ALGERIAN EMBASSY IN HANOI OCT 11.</p>

                            between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> in
                            New York on October 12 had been a positive contribution to our bilateral
                            relations, Subjects of interest to both countries had been frankly and
                            fully discussed and the high-level dialogue between senior officials
                            maintained. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said he
                            hopes the U.S. Government now understands why the GOA cannot take
                            immediate action on certain matters of interest to us, but must wait for
                            an appropriate moment to do so.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Hijacking</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said that the GOA
                            still believes a written exchange of letters between our two governments
                            on the question of how to handle hijackers <pb n="2" xml:id="d35-02"
                                facs="d35-02"/>would be useful. He emphasized that the GOA wishes to
                            deal with us on this question bilaterally. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that the formula
                            proposed by <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> (forbidding a
                            hijacked aircraft to land in Algeria) is difficult for us to accept
                            because of the risk to the passengers, the crew and aircraft itself. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> referred to the
                            observation made by Mr. Rein in their conversation of September 14. Even
                            though he understood that Mr. Rein's observation did not represent the
                            official position of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, he
                            wondered if we could not consider it as a point of departure in an
                            attempt to find a formula that would be satisfactory to both countries.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> agreed that we would
                            continue to examine this question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> mentioned that two of
                            the hijackers of the Delta aircraft were escaped convicts. Although we
                            had several times informed the GOA of their criminal records, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> appeared
                            unaware of this fact when the subject came up in the discussion with the
                            Secretary in New York. The Foreign Minister had said, however, that we
                            should be able to work together regarding common criminals. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> asked that he be
                            provided with a complete legal dossier on these two hijackers which
                            would enable the Algerian judicial authorities to present a formal case
                            against them in an Algerian court. It was agreed that the two
                            governments would remain in touch on this question.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Middle East, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> referred to the discussion between Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> and asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> now has a plan for a Middle East
                            settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> is much more
                            deeply involved in this problem than he and that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> might wish to call on him for
                            a fuller explanation. Speaking personally, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that it was his impression,
                            after having participated in some of the Secretary's bilateral meetings
                            in New York, that the Secretary intends to continue his efforts to find
                            a solution to the Middle East problem, beginning with a partial
                            settlement at the Suez Canal. No one could say at the moment <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d35-03" facs="d35-03"/>exactly what proposal the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might make or what steps we might take,
                            but no one in Washington is satisfied with the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> asked, “Are you
                            thinking of the Palestinians?” and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> replied that we fully realize the need for a
                            settlement that takes into account the rights of the Palestinian people.
                            The problem, as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            said, is who speaks for the Palestinians? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> replied that history and justice speak for
                            them. During the Algerian Civil War not all Algerians spoke with one
                            voice, yet there was an obvious solution—to stop the fighting and set up
                            an interim government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that as far as the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            concerned, no “solution” which threatens the existence of Israel is
                            acceptable. Israel's exact frontiers, however, are another question. As
                            for a Palestinian state or provisional government, each Arab country
                            would have its own view and each would try to influence the
                            Palestinians. Egypt, for example, had proposed a provisional Palestinian
                            Government, but now seemed to be backing away from that proposal. If
                            there were a clear, unified Arab/Palestinian position, it would be
                            easier to deal with. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3"
                                >Bousselham</persName> repeated Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName>'s remark to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> that the GOA does not
                            want to frustrate any initiatives; since the Palestinian problem affects
                            bilateral GOA/<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> relations, the GOA is
                            naturally interested in finding a solution.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> inquired concerning
                            the present state of negotiations on Vietnam. He said that the GOA is
                            convinced that Hanoi has real problems and it is now seriously looking
                            for a solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that he had the impression that the present negotiations are
                            perhaps for the first time going to the heart of the problem. The
                            problem is not an easy one for the U.S., which must find a solution
                            which gives the South Vietnamese people an opportunity to determine
                            their own future and at the same time does not give the American people
                            a feeling that they have deserted an ally. Dr. <persName

                            formula. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said that
                            the GOA strongly hoped a solution could be worked out. Although he was
                            without instructions, he was sure that his government would be willing
                            to assist in any way that the USG thinks would be helpful. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied with thanks <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d35-04" facs="d35-04"/>to the GOA for its previous
                            assistance in Vietnam problems and said that everything was now in the
                            hands of the President and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"

                        <p>In a brief discussion of the El Paso-SONATRACH contract, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> expressed optimism. He said
                            that some officers of Chemico had recently gone to Algiers to discuss
                            the construction of the liquefaction plant and that he is confident that
                            an agreement on the assignment of proceeds issue can be worked out.
                            Finance Minister Mahroug had reserved only the point of whether GOA
                            should be required to pay one month in advance. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> also mentioned that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kearns</persName>, in his last meeting
                            with Mahroug, had talked of EX-IM investments of $1.2 billion in Algeria
                            in 1973.</p>

                        <p>Regarding the Procter &amp; Gamble (P &amp; G) claim, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA3">Bousselham</persName> said that the GOA had never
                            made a single lump sum settlement in previous nationalization cases and
                            that it was extremely unlikely that it would set such a precedent in the
                            P &amp; G case. He felt sure that there must have been some
                            misunderstanding if P &amp; G had received the impression that they
                            would get a single lump sum payment. He agreed with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>, however, that it was important
                            to settle this final corporate claim quickly and said that he would do
                            his best to work toward a mutually satisfactory solution.</p>

                            expressed great appreciation for the assistance of the <gloss

                            Ph.D. candidates to come to the U.S. to complete their studies. He said
                            that all six (who are now studying in the U.S.) are extremely impressive
                            and that their presence here is an important asset in the improvement of

                        <p>Embassy Airgram A-72 forwards a conversation of significance which I had
                            with the Crown Prince on March 20.</p>
                        <p>It has, as you well know, been our objective to try to move away from the
                            very precise earlier commitments to assist the Crown Prince at the time
                            of his succession. Changes in the Libyan scene have made this kind of
                            help less and less feasible and changes at home have decreased the
                            likelihood that we would render special help of the kind contemplated.
                            At the same time we have wished to avoid creating a feeling in the Crown
                            Prince that we no longer support him for the succession.</p>
                        <p>Through various contacts we have been moving to emphasize that the Crown
                            Prince and his followers must bear the major responsibility for a
                            successful succession.</p>
                        <p>Following on the very helpful guidance on this matter in which you
                            collaborated, I took the opportunity during an audience on March 20 to
                            spell out our position directly to the Prince. The changes which
                            sometimes take place in emphases and meaning when such messages are
                            transmitted indirectly made it in my view desirable that our views be
                            conveyed directly to the Prince. I came away with a feeling that he had
                            read the message and that he now understands and accepts the fact that
                            his accession to the throne depends upon internal rather than external
                            factors.</p>
                        <p>Even though we need no longer consider our precise commitments of an
                            earlier day, I feel that it remains important to us to keep in touch
                            with the Prince through the channel which we have used now for many
                            years. This gives us a further insight into his thinking and provides a
                            link which could assist materially in the preservation of our once major
                            interest in Libya once he accedes to the throne.</p>

                        <p>The conversation reported in the airgram and reports I have had of
                            contacts with him by other diplomats suggest a very definite improvement
                            in the Prince's awareness of his position and his problems. We also have
                            the feeling that he is now for the first time seeking to widen the
                            circle of his own supporters. The Moroccans and the Tunisians are both
                            making special efforts both in Libya and in connection with his
                            forthcoming visits to the Maghreb states. Morocco and Tunisia now for
                            the first time since my arrival here have first class Ambassadors in
                            Libya, who are making relations with the Crown Prince one of their
                            special objectives. I think we can take some of the credit for this
                            development since we have stressed to both governments on many occasions
                            the importance of their representation in Libya.</p>

                        <p>The import of the coup in Libya will be clearer in another 24-48 hours,
                            Following is to give you the best Washington appraisal as of the end of
                            the day (Monday).</p>
                        <p>A group of young military officers has staged a coup, proclaimed the
                            “Arab Republic of Libya” and set up a Revolutionary Command Council. The
                            head of the council is the only individual publicly named so far as
                            associated with the coup. He is a 34-year-old former officer who has
                            apparently been brought out of “retirement,” Colonel Sa'ad al-Din
                            Abu-Shuawayrib. He received his basic military education in the UAR
                            Cadet College but has since attended US military schools, including
                            Command and General Staff Officer Course in 1964-65. His bio in
                            intelligence files describes him as pro-US, but of course no one should
                            lean too heavily on that description in present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The best we can say about the political complexion of the new government
                            without knowing more about its composition is that its very few initial
                            pronouncements show some moderation. For instance, representatives of
                            the coup group have assured our charge that the coup was directed at the
                            removal of internal corruption—of which there has been an increasing
                            amount recently—and not at any foreign group, east or west. The new
                            government has promised to protect foreign interests, including oil
                            companies. The five-point statement proclaiming the new government said
                            the regime would be socialist, would seek solidarity with the third
                            world and would be based on the Koran. <pb n="2" xml:id="d37-02"
                                facs="d37-02"/>By current Arab standards, this is a mild statement,
                            especially since it omits the vigorous statements on pursuing the
                            struggle for Palestine that one would expect of my more radical
                            group.</p>
                        <p>During the day, we have watched for signs of counter-action by forces
                            seeking to rally behind the monarchy. None so far as we can tell have
                            materialized. The King himself, 80, is in Turkey. The Crown Prince
                            apparently went on the air, renounced his prerogatives as viceroy and
                            urged support of the Revolutionary Command Council. Elements of the
                            police and military which we thought might have resisted have one by one
                            been reported as supporting the coup. The major element not heard from
                            is a large group of civilian politicians who owed their bread and butter
                            to the monarchy. We may learn more of how the politicians have split
                            when the composition of any new cabinet becomes apparent, but in any
                            case resistance now would seem to depend on support from within the army
                            and possibilities for that have narrowed.</p>
                        <p>Since Americans do not seem to be in danger, the main contingencies we
                            have to think about involve Wheelus Base. The Royal Libyan Air Force is
                            based there and depends entirely on US logistical support. If there were
                            any counter-coup, we would have to consider how to react to an Air Force
                            request for support. We might also have to handle requests for asylum at
                            the base. And eventually, the chronic pressures for us to give up the
                            base may reassert themselves. None of these seem to be upon us tonight,
                            so I will not take up your time discussing them. In short, we want to
                            keep Wheelus insulated from this to the maximum extent possible.</p>

                        <p>I attach a working paper on our options in Libya (Tab B) and a brief
                            discussion of possible future problems in the country (Tab C). The paper
                            was prepared for the meeting of the African Inter-Departmental Group on
                            September 2. While it has not been formally cleared with the members
                            present, the paper met with general initial approval and has benefited
                            from subsequent detailed suggestions from participating agencies,
                            including <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JCS1"

                        <p>Events are now moving rapidly in Libya. Former centers of royalist
                            influence in eastern Cyrenaica have fallen to the new regime, and there
                            is little likelihood of any further resistance.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, with regard to the options that appear open to us, I have
                            two recommendations on which we would welcome your decision:</p>
                        <p>1. That we decide to maintain diplomatic relations with the new Libyan
                            regime as soon as it becomes clear to us that it is, in fact, in
                            unchallenged control of the country. The scenario I propose would
                            consist of three steps:</p>
                        <p>a. We issue a statement (Tab A) responding affirmatively to the statement
                            of the Revolutionary Command <pb n="2" xml:id="d38-02" facs="d38-02"
                            />Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) that all nations
                            maintaining diplomatic relations with Libya be considered to have
                            recognized the new government;</p>
                        <p>b. we instruct our Charge in Tripoli, or alternatively our
                            officer-in-charge in Benghazi, to present himself officially to the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, bearing a copy of our
                            statement;</p>
                        <p>c. when we perceive the moment opportune we ask for confirmation of the
                            agreement for our Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>2. That we coordinate the timing of the issuance of our statement with
                            the British. They appear to be moving very rapidly towards recognition
                            and could well announce it within the next few days.</p>

                        <p>* This memorandum was prepared by the Office of National Estimates. It
                            was discussed with representatives of the Office of Current Intelligence
                            and the Office of Economic Research, who are in general agreement with
                            its judgments.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Nature of the New Regime</p>
                        <p>1. The identity of the rulers of the new Libyan government remains
                            unclear and no authoritative statements of their objectives and
                            priorities have been made. Nonetheless, they appear in control, and
                            continue to show a posture of moderation and caution. Though avowing
                            “socialism”, no Libyan leader has mouthed the extremist slogans typical
                            of Arab radicals. To the contrary, such themes as the protection of
                            foreign lives and property, the fulfillment of international
                            obligations, and the elimination of corruption and favoritism at home
                            have been stressed. “Social reform” has been emphasized far more than
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d39-03" facs="d39-03"/>socialism in Libyan
                            broadcasts. In private conversations with US officials, members of the
                            ruling Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) have gone even further, and have given the impression
                            of seeking very close relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. Such statements may be deliberate dissimulation, designed to reduce
                            any threat of foreign counterrevolutionary intervention. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably feared US/<gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention; in such circumstances,
                            conciliatory reassurances made good sense. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> did put Idris in power and signed a mutual defense
                            agreement with him. At the time of the coup, there were some 1,100
                            British troops near Tobruq, along with an MF base close by. In addition
                            there was Wheelus, with some 5,000 American personnel, and the Sixth
                            Fleet was not far away.</p>
                        <p>3. Whatever the case, the moderate posture of the Libyan regime is
                            probably temporary, though there are no very good grounds for predicting
                            just when or how this stance will change. We base the judgment that it
                            will on the general tendency of Arab politics over the past two decades:
                            other military-dominated revolutionary regimes have tended, almost
                            without exception, to become more leftist and extreme with the passage
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d39-04" facs="d39-04"/>of time. In Egypt's case
                            this has come about under one leader. In Syria and Iraq, it was the
                            result of successive military coups which brought ever more radical
                            regimes to power.</p>
                        <p>4. Libya could follow either path, or both. It has already declared
                            itself in the Arab revolutionary camp, and will quickly be receiving
                            advice from its new brethren. While the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> members—the ultimate power in Libya—remain shadow
                            figures, we know that at least some civilian officials of their new
                            government will be highly susceptible to this type of influence. So, in
                            all probability, will be the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> itself,
                            not wanting its image tarnished by accusations that it is less than
                            sincere or ardent.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Future of Libyan Politics</p>
                        <p>5. Beyond this, the coup—as did the July 1958 one in Iraq—has probably
                            created a precedent which will not be forgotten. Most observers inside
                            and outside of Libya had long believed that a military takeover was
                            unlikely in Idris' lifetime. The little army of 8,000 (with only 200-300
                            officers) was greatly outnumbered by the royalist police forces; it
                            lacked that essential instrument of Arab revolution, the tank. The still
                            powerful tribes in Cyrenaica were loyal to the King, who in fact was
                            generally respected by most Libyans. The task of secretly <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d39-05" facs="d39-05"/>planning and carrying out a
                            coordinated takeover of the principal population centers separated by
                            hundreds of miles of desert seemed insuperable.</p>
                        <p>6. But the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, with some armored cars,
                            proved it could be done, and this lesson is not likely to be lost on
                            other Libyans in the future. We do not know how many officers—apparently
                            mostly captains and lieutenants—are in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>, but suspect the group is small enough to maintain
                            secrecy and security and large enough to assure adequate direction and
                            command a coup—perhaps 50 to 60 people. Nor do we know how cohesive this
                            group is, or how susceptible its members might be to possible Algerian
                            or Egyptian influence and intrigue. In the years ahead, the Libyan army
                            will almost certainly be expanded (the old regime had already embarked
                            on a program which would upgrade its equipment and nearly double its
                            size). In the new and more heated political climate of Libya, small
                            clandestine officer groups of Baathist, Arab Nationalists and the like
                            will appear; over time, some may succeed in seizing power.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Western Military Facilities</p>
                        <p>7. The US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will likely be in for
                            some sticky times in the years ahead. An overriding theme of the new <pb
                                n="6" xml:id="d39-06" facs="d39-06"/>government, and of any
                            conceivable successor, is an aggressive and militant anti-Israeli
                            posture, and American support of Israel will cause serious problems. For
                            the moment, the new government has said nothing about Wheelus and the
                            British military facilities in Libya, or made any move against them. As
                            it consolidates its hold on power and seeks to get more and more into
                            the mainstream of Arab nationalism, it will probably do so. It might
                            permit them to remain until the respective treaties expire: for example,
                            it could, under the terms of the Base Rights Agreement, formally give
                            notice to the US in December 1970 that it must be out of Wheelus within
                            a year. But pressures, both internal and external, for earlier removal
                            will be strong, and we would give Wheelus only a 50-50 chance of
                            survival until late 1971—and virtually no chance at all of remaining
                            after that. The British, already disliked as the patrons of the old
                            regime, are unlikely to remain all the way to 1973, when their mutual
                            defense pact expires.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Petroleum Policy</p>
                        <p>8. Relations with the oil companies will be a more complicated matter; in
                            this field, such radical tendencies <pb n="7" xml:id="d39-07"
                                facs="d39-07"/>as the new regime may have are likely to be tempered
                            by practical considerations. Idris' government had already initiated
                            negotiations aimed at substantially raising Libya's share of oil
                            revenues. These will of course continue, and Libyan demands may
                            increase. The new regime may follow the course of either of the other
                            two Arab radical oil producers, Iraq or Algeria. The former has left
                            current operations pretty much alone, though it has prevented the
                                US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French owned Iraq Petroleum
                            Company from expanding into new concession areas. The Algerians have
                            been much tougher. Indeed at the time of the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
                            they took the extreme step of putting all American companies (which
                            controlled only about 10 percent of total output) under Algerian
                            management and forbade the repatriation of any earnings, an arrangement
                            still in effect. With the French companies, which produce the bulk of
                            Algeria's petroleum, the government has been less harsh, but it has not
                            hesitated to engage in harassment in the quest for more revenue and more
                            output. The new Libyan government is likely to make similar demands on
                            the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> companies which produce
                            nearly all the Libyan oil. We doubt, however, that they will be treated
                            as rigorously as American producers have been in Algeria, though such
                            treatment cannot be ruled out, especially in the event of another major
                            Arab-Israeli war.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d39-08" facs="d39-08"/>
                        <p>9. There are some rather persuasive reasons why Libyan oil policy appears
                            more likely to resemble that of Algeria. Like the latter, Libya holds
                            some high cards; its oil comes from west of the Suez Canal and is of a
                            very low sulphur content. Hence, shipping costs to Europe are lower, and
                            so are those of refining; the process of removing sulphur to prevent air
                            pollution is a fairly expensive one. Further, the sheer magnitude of
                            Libyan output, now over three million barrels per day and rapidly
                            climbing, will give the regime strength in dealing with the oil
                            companies. Even the implied threat of a sudden cut-off of these supplies
                            which meet about a quarter of Europe's demand would have disruptive
                            effect—even though alternative but more expensive—sources of supply
                            would be available. Thus the Libyan government is in a position to get
                            progressively more demanding with the oil companies. How far and how
                            fast it might go will, of course, depend on how far and how fast the
                            present regime—or a successor—moves in a generally radical direction,
                            though in the last analysis the Libyans will not wish to risk losing
                            their oil revenues, on which they are almost completely dependent.</p>

                        <p>10. The institution of the Khartoum subsidies, the maintenance of a
                            united front against Israel, and the ending of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s subversive efforts and hostile
                            propaganda lulled the conservative or moderate Arab
                            governments—including Libya—into a false sense of security. We believe
                            that the governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (and Morocco and
                            Tunisia) may—to varying degrees—be more susceptible to overthrow than
                            they were before the Libyan coup. There is evidence of substantial
                            popular discontent in each country. Their regimes—like that of Idris—are
                            viewed by many of their citizens as too friendly to the US, soft on
                            Israel, corrupt, and unconcerned with the welfare of the ordinary
                            citizen. The lesson that a handful of obscure junior army officers can
                            successfully pull off a coup against a conservative regime in very
                            difficult circumstances will not be lost in these countries.</p>
                        <p>11. If in the next year or two, one or more of these moderate regimes
                            were overthrown, this would not mean that some new and more effective
                            stage of Arab political unity, under <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> or anybody else, would be in the offing. For the
                            most part, Arab unity has been a myth, but there has been a fairly <pb
                                n="10" xml:id="d39-10" facs="d39-10"/>consistent unity amongst
                            revolutionary Arab states on the subject of Israel. It should be
                            remembered that, in the aftermath of the June war, the Arab
                            radicals—Iraq and Algeria included —strongly urged using Arab oil as a
                            means of pressuring the US to change its pro-Israeli policies. The
                            refusal of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Libya to join in killed that
                            project. Libya might not be so reluctant again. Were new revolutionary
                            governments to appear in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, this could mean very
                            difficult times for American oil companies throughout the Arab world. In
                            any event, the Libyan coup represents one more step in a process of
                            polarization in the Middle East, which could see the Arabs all aligned
                            on one side, confronting the US as well as Israel on the other.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Libyan coup has understandably created concern in pro-Western moderate
                            Arab states and questions have once more been raised regarding
                            credibility of US “commitments” to friends. While appreciating that
                            discussion this issue can be delicate matter and runs risk either of
                            generating requests for additional commitments or of discouraging
                            friendly regime, Department nevertheless feels it is highly important
                            our missions have matter in clear perspective. To extent it is useful,
                            points this telegram may be used in discussions with host
                            government.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has in various ways over past
                            twenty years expressed its concern and interest in territorial
                            integrity, stability <pb n="2" xml:id="d40-02" facs="d40-02"/>and
                            independence countries whose policies generally oriented in our
                            direction. In certain countries, further, US has had installations of
                            importance to it whose presence has implied a US interest.</p>
                        <p>3. States can to certain extent share responsibility in matters of
                            external threat to one of them, but internal security depends in last
                            analysis on government in power. In some cases US has made specific
                            commitment to consult in event of external aggression but nowhere in
                            Arab world have we made specific commitment to commit forces, to support
                            specific regimes or to intervene in internal disorders. Making of such
                            commitments by the US raises Constitutional questions, number of which
                            are currently under study by Congress.</p>
                        <p>4. We are concerned, naturally, for survival of friendly regimes and
                            would have an interest therefore in how they deal with internal problems
                            which may threaten their stability and progress. To some extent we can
                            be of help to government that is helping itself to ward off such threats
                            in timely <pb n="3" xml:id="d40-03" facs="d40-03"/>and constructive
                            fashion, but in last analysis stability and security of regime depends
                            overwhelmingly on its own actions. US strongly believes viability
                            greatest where regimes maintain enlightened, vigilant attention to basic
                            national social and economic needs. US has endeavored, while not
                            ignoring direct security requirements, to emphasize these other needs in
                            relations with its friends. Where regimes, either through growing
                            distance from people, inattention, or toleration of corruption, make
                            themselves vulnerable to sudden change, there is little US can do to
                            save them from their own weakness.</p>
                        <p>5. In specific case of Libya, <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                            149764 (being repeated to addressee posts) outlines limitations of US
                            commitments. Conversations with key Libyan figures including King and
                            Crown Prince over last few years have emphasized both that US most
                            unlikely to intervene in internal disorders and that US would have grave
                            doubts regarding viability regime imposed or reimposed by outside
                            military intervention.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d40-04" facs="d40-04"/>
                        <p>6. Intervention to support or preserve specific regime unable to help
                            itself is serious and unpopular matter in modern context and may raise
                            international legal questions. Even French, who have specific
                            commitments with regard to certain African states, carry out their
                            responsibilities with greatest discretion. US experience further has
                            suggested that even when foreign government might be sympathetic to
                            intervention, internal political factors within its own borders might
                            seriously limit support it is able to give in this regard.</p>
                        <p>7. One further factor needs emphasizing. In dynamics of modern politics,
                            slogans and categories can be misleading. Full evaluation of nature each
                            country's problems necessary before reaching conclusions on implications
                            of political change. Too rapid an assumption regarding nature or support
                            of political change can seriously affect ability of interested neighbors
                            (like Tunisia in case of Libya) to influence and determine full results
                            and effects of such change.</p>

                            OCTOBER 30. AFTER ABOUT NINETY MINUTES DISCUSSION VARIOUS MATTERS RAISED
                            BY AMBASSADOR AND BEING REPORTED SEPTELS, FORNMIN INTRODUCED BASE
                            QUESTION STATING THAT HE GREATLY VALUED HIS RELATIONS WITH AMBASSADOR
                            AND APPRECIATED HIS THOUGHTFULNESS AND WISDOM. FORNMIN SAID HE HOPED
                            THEY WOULD ALWAYS WORK TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY. ONE THING WHICH NOW
                            TROUBLED LIBYAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS WAS PRESENCE OF OUR MILITARY BASE.
                            MILITARY BASES DO NOT HELP CREATE GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND
                            US HAD MANY GOOD FRIENDS ON WHOSE TERRITORIES IT DID NOT HAVE SUCH
                            INSTALLATIONS. IN CASE OF LIBYA, IT WAS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY,
                            FOLLOWING REVOLUTION, THAT THE AMERICAN BASE BE ELIMINATED, SINCE THE
                            BASE HAD ALREADY CAUSED PROBLEMS BETWEEN LIBYA AND THE US SUCH AS TWO
                            EXFILTRATION CASES.</p>

                        <p>2. FORNMIN THEN PRESENTED NOTE (INFORMAL TRANSLATION SENT BENGHAZI 1133)
                            TO AMBASSADOR, CALLING ON “<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND
                            AMERICAN PEOPLE” TO “ENTER INTO URGENT AND FRIENDLY DISCUSSIONS WITH
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> AIMED AT URGENT EVACUATION
                            FROM ALL LIBYAN TERRITORIES. MINISTER ADDED THAT HE HAD PRESENTED
                            SIMILAR NOTE TO BRITISH AMBASSADOR YESTERDAY AND SAID HE HOPED THAT THE
                            AMBASSADOR WOULD APPRECIATE ITS IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY. AMBASSADOR
                            RESERVED POSITION RE SUBSTANCE OF NOTE, INCLUDING FOREGOING POINTS, BUT
                            AGREED TRANSMIT IT PROMPTLY TO WASHINGTON FOR STUDY. HE ADDED THAT WE
                            WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE NOTE OUR EARLIEST ATTENTION BUT HE WAS SURE
                            MINISTER WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A COMPLICATED AND VERY IMPORTANT
                            SUBJECT. HE URGED MINISTER TO SEE THAT PRESS TREATMENT OF THIS SUBJECT
                            IN LIBYA WAS KEPT IN LOW KEY AND DID NOT ADD TO INHERENT DIFFICULTIES OF
                            PROBLEM. HE REMINDED MINISTER THAT HE HAD TOLD MIN AT THE BEGINNING OF
                            THEIR MEETING THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO WASHINGTON FOR CONSULTATIONS AND
                            THAT THIS NOTE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE CLOSELY STUDIED AT THAT TIME. MINISTER
                            SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD MATTER WAS IMPORTANT BUT HE FAILED SEE HOW IT
                            WAS SO COMPLICATED. RE PUBLICITY, MINISTER SAID HE DID NOT INTEND
                            RELEASE TEXT OF NOTE BUT TO HANDLE IN SAME LIMITED TERMS AS WITH BRITISH
                            NOTE YESTERDAY.</p>
                        <p>3. AMBASSADOR THEN SOUGHT CLARIFY TERMINATION PROVISIONS OF AGREEMENT.
                            MINISTER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD CORRECT POSITON, MAKING CLEAR AT SAME TIME
                            THAT WHAT <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> SEEKS IS EARLIER AGREED

                            note about Wheelus are being handled.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> have cleared a note to the
                            Libyans and instructions to <persName>Palmer</persName> incorporating
                            the following points:</p>
                        <p>The US is prepared to begin talks about December 15 on withdrawal of US
                            military facilities from Libya.</p>
                        <p>The US trusts training can resume in the interim.</p>
                        <p>If asked, <persName>Palmer</persName> is authorized to say that the talks
                            could cover the possibility of our evacuating the base before
                            termination of the agreement (December 1972).</p>
                        <p>They decided that they did not need to clear this position with the
                            President. Having lost my argument with <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> that it made sense to check this with the
                            President in view of his interest in our general posture, I asked that
                            they send over an information memo explaining their position.</p>
                        <p>In substance, I do not see much problem in the position that they have
                            taken, In fact, <persName>Palmer</persName> will go in with this line,
                            receive a curt response and be back with a recommendation to drop the
                            effort to resume training and perhaps to begin talks before December 15.
                            The substantive issue is whether we have a fight with the Libyans over
                            this or whether we bow to the inevitable gracefully.</p>
                        <p>You are the judge of whether the bureaucratic principle involved here is
                            a matter of concern. The Secretaries have in effect assumed that we are
                            out of the base and that the only questions to be decided now are the
                            tactics of negotiating an orderly withdrawal. They have decided that
                            they do not need to bother the President with these operational
                            questions. I do not quarrel with the judgment about the base; the only
                            question is whether you feel the President is sufficiently reconciled to
                            the situation that he will not be taken aback by the Secretaries
                            decision.</p>

                                Regime—Summary and Critique</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The question the President asked was whether there is any way we could
                            create penalties that might deter the Libyan government from its
                            leftward course.</p>
                        <p>The paper covers this ground:</p>
                        <p>1. It characterizes (page 1) the new Libyan government as insecure,
                            inexperienced, zenophobic, perhaps divided but as yet without visible
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>2. It details US economic interests (page 1 and Annex A) in terms of the
                            $5 billion (replacement value) private oil investment, $500 million in
                            annual profits to US corporations and 25% of Western Europe's oil
                            consumption which could not all be replaced from other sources until
                            1971. It concludes that Western Europe is too dependent on Libyan crude
                            to refuse to buy. Only 8% of Libyan production comes to the US.</p>
                        <p>3. It describes (bottom of p. 2) our choice in developing a strategy
                            toward the new Libyan government as between:</p>
                        <p>a. “policy of confrontation” and</p>
                        <p>b. “a policy which would involve some give on our part with a view to
                            developing longer-term relationships with the new and still insecure
                            regime.” [State prefers this.]</p>
                        <p>4. It examines—and this is the bulk of the paper (pp. 3-9)—a collection
                            of possible alternative pressures. [The paper concludes that most are
                            unsatisfactory because the leverage is not predominantly on the US
                            side.]</p>

                        <p>Summary of the Alternatives: We recommend that you scan pages 3-9 but for
                            the sake of simplifying these options fall into the following
                            categories:</p>
                        <p>1. Presence of US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases. These options
                            boil down to a series of delaying tactics and, hopefully, some NATO
                            European (Turkey, West Germany) pressures on Libya to honor its base
                            agreements. They culminate with the US requesting the support of
                            European friends in breaking diplomatic relations with Libya if the
                            regime refuses.</p>
                        <p>a. The argument for this approach is to see whether such pressures would
                            widen splits within the regime.</p>
                        <p>b. The arguments against are that the regime in its present mood is
                            unlikely to respond to this kind of pressure—especially NATO
                            pressure—and that it is doubtful that West Germany and others would risk
                            their economic interests to support us.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic pressures range through requesting US companies to curtail
                            their offtake, advising US technicians to leave, cutting off US oil
                            imports from Libya, restricting additional US investment, and freezing
                            Libyan reserves in the US. There are specific arguments on each one of
                            these in the paper (pp. 4-6) but in general they boil down to these:</p>
                        <p>a. The argument for is that oil income is the Libyan government's main
                            source of income. Any move that effectively cut into this would cause
                            Libyan concern, although Libya now has more income than it can use so it
                            has some cushion.</p>
                        <p>b. The argument against is essentially that US companies would suffer
                            more than the Libyan government. European companies are ready to replace
                            American in marketing Libyan oil. The Libyan government could cause some
                            disruption in foreign exchange markets by shifting its reserves
                            suddenly.</p>
                        <p>3. Military actions range through a Sixth Fleet show of force off the
                            Libyan coast and movement of troops (hopefully in concert with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) to hold training areas [text not

                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d44-03" facs="d44-03"/>
                        <p>a. The argument for would be to make the regime uncertain about our
                            intentions toward it [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>b. The argument against is that we would have to prepare for longer term
                            occupation if we intended a show of force beyond mere evacuation of
                            Americans. This would provoke a sharp reaction in the Arab world and,
                            within Libya, would not protect the farflung installations of US oil
                            companies.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>1. It seems to us that the base-related and [text not declassified]
                            political pressures would probably not work, and the leverage is on the
                            wrong side for the economic pressures.</p>
                        <p>2. A landing of forces at Wheelus seems an option worth considering, but
                            the longer they stayed the less able they would be to maintain the cover
                            of evacuating Americans and the more vulnerable private oil
                            installations would become.</p>
                        <p>3. We suggest an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> briefing covering
                            these points:</p>
                        <p>a. The character of the Libyan regime.</p>
                        <p>b. The US policy choice—confront or play along.</p>
                        <p>c. The options available in a policy of confrontation and their
                            risks.</p>
                        <p>d. What we would have to do if we play along and the risks.</p>
                        <p>4. Dave Newsom seems the logical one to do the briefing. He knows Libya.
                            He is the responsible Assistant Secretary. He is a good briefer.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Present Situation:</p>
                        <p>A small group of young Army officers (the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) has overthrown the Libyan monarchy. The political
                            inclinations of this group are still unclear, and possibly varied. While
                            the group has installed a civilian cabinet which includes two key
                            members who violently disagree with our Middle East policy, it is still
                            too early to state that either the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            or the civilian government is fundamentally anti-U.S. For the moment it
                            appears that latent Libyan xenophobia, which has spilled over into
                            Libyan-U.S. relations in recent weeks, also characterizes the new
                            regime's attitudes toward all foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Libyan policy emphasizes Libyan nationalism in internal matters while
                            identifying itself closely with radical Arab positions internationally.
                            The new government has threatened an important U.S. interest by renewing
                            the demands, posed twice under the monarchy but reversed by the King,
                            for the removal of the U.S. and British bases and facilities.</p>
                        <p>While there is no discernible opposition, the regime shows signs of
                            insecurity and inexperience. It is particularly concerned about the
                            eastern region, Cyrenaica, the power base of the Senussi monarchy, and
                            rural areas of Tripolitania. Unless the Army should split, the national
                            police, now effectively neutralized by the Army, represents the only
                            possible counterforce. The former King has voluntarily moved to Egypt
                            this month; the Crown Prince is in jail. Other possible contenders to
                            the throne remain free but under surveillance in Benghazi.</p>
                        <p>The other major U.S. interest, the $5 billion (replacement value) in oil
                            investment, remains untouched for the moment. The regime has pledged
                            respect for the oil agreements and has so far demonstrated this except
                            in one case in which a company was closely tied to associates of the
                            former King. We see no immediate threat to these interests, although
                            such could result if the regime is threatened, or becomes increasingly
                            unstable, or if there were a real confrontation over Wheelus, or in the
                            event of renewed hostilities in the Middle East. While only 8 percent of
                            Libya's 3 million bbls/day production comes to the U.S., 90 percent <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d44-05" facs="d44-05"/>is produced by twenty-eight
                            American companies. Their activity netted the U.S. balance of payments
                            $680 million in 1968. Sales are principally to West Germany, the U.K.,
                            Italy and Spain; Europe is now dependent on Libya for 25 percent (3
                            million bbls/day of short-haul oil) of its oil requirements; if Libyan
                            oil were cut off, the shortfall could not be made up within less than
                            one year because of production and transportation problems.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Present U.S. Strategy:</p>
                        <p>Our present strategy is to seek to establish satisfactory relations with
                            the new regime. The return to our balance of payments and the security
                            of U.S. investments in oil are considered our primary interests. We seek
                            to retain our military facilities, but not at the expense of threatening
                            our economic return. We also wish to protect European dependence on
                            Libyan oil; it is literally the only “irreplaceable” oil in the world,
                            from the point of view both of quality and geographic location.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans have asked that we withdraw from Wheelus before December 24,
                            1971, the earliest date on which the present agreement could be allowed
                            to expire. We plan an early response to the Libyan request in which we
                            will agree to the principle of early withdrawal and propose detailed
                            discussions. While there is no doubt that the removal of the base is, as
                            it always has been, a popular local issue, at least some military
                            officers in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> may be more
                            interested in retaining our help in the creation of a Libyan air force
                            and in an orderly transition. Their freedom of action may be limited by
                            the intense popular feeling against our stand on the Arab-Israel issue.
                            A change in the status of the base seems inevitable; our ability to
                            secure an extension of the essential training facilities at Wheelus is
                            now unclear. We have as yet, however, found no fully satisfactory
                            alternative site(s) for this training. The British, too, are prepared to
                            accept a change in the status of their facilities. They hope to remain
                            the prime military supplier to the Libyans and to retain some training
                            rights, however. The British have the advantage of less identification
                            with Israel.</p>
                        <p>In developing our short-term strategy vis-à-vis the new Libyan
                            government, we have a choice between a policy which is essentially that
                            of confrontation and a policy which would involve some give on our part
                            with a view to developing longer-term relationships with the new and
                            still insecure regime. In general, we opt for the latter.</p>

                        <p>In response to the request of the WSAG the following possible alternative
                            pressures on or against the regime are set forth. They are not mutually
                            exclusive; they could be applied single or in combination. Because of
                            the generally increased risk each would pose to our economic interests
                            in Libya, because almost any one of them would place our broader
                            interests in jeopardy throughout the Arab world, and because some of
                            them would threaten Europe's dependence on Libyan oil, none of the
                            alternatives is recommended at this time. Annexes exploring in greater
                            detail the practical implications of economic pressures, military
                            actions, and covert activities are attached.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Possible Immediate Pressures:</p>
                        <p>a. Delay a reply to the note on Wheelus or reply in the negative.</p>
                        <p>PRO: Could create uncertainty in <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and
                            cabinet regarding our intentions; might effect split among them. Night
                            delay further action on their part because of fear of our real
                            designs.</p>
                        <p>CON: More likely, that delay would lead regime to open campaign in
                            streets against U.S. and base. Cairo and probably the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would support campaign and attack
                            U.S. position. Street campaign could pose serious threat to safety of
                            U.S. community, investment, base and Embassy; this, in turn, would
                            necessitate some form of protection of each.</p>
                        <p>b. Enlist NATO countries to express concern over premature departure from
                            U.S. and U.K. bases.</p>
                        <p>PRO: Certain NATO countries such as Turkey and West Germany have more
                            leverage than we in Libya. Their expressed concern over future security
                            of NATO area and Libya without bases might have an impact on <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. Fact that U.S. and U.K. not alone in
                            this concern might slow down demands for withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>CON: Idea of NATO pressure has always produced strong adverse reaction in
                            Libya. Present Libyan <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> led fight in
                            1967 to cut off oil shipments to West Germany. He could do so again. It
                            is doubtful that West Germany and others would risk strategic economic
                            interests to support us.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d44-07" facs="d44-07"/>
                        <p>c. Insist that Libyans honor their international agreements as the have
                            assured all concerned they would; if they refuse, break diplomatic
                            relations in reaction to clear contravention of their earlier
                            assurances. Seek support of European friends in doing so.</p>
                        <p>PRO: If successful, this might cause regime to re-think pressures on us
                            for an early withdrawal. <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has been
                            conscious of its international image. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>CON: Such action would rob us of access to the new regime at a critical
                            time. It would undoubtedly result in further agitation against U.S.
                            citizens and installations unless the military regime was sufficiently
                            concerned about public disorders of any kind to prevent them. It would
                            probably be welcomed by the more extreme elements in the country.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Pressures on Libyan Economy:</p>
                        <p>a. Request the American companies to curtail their oil offtake from
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>PRO: Assuming legal means could be found to induce voluntary cooperation
                            by the companies concerned, this would strike at Libya's main resource
                            and all-but-exclusive source of public revenues and foreign
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>CON: The large number of U.S. companies involved would make voluntary
                            compliance difficult. Since many are small and without alternative
                            sources to meet their European contract commitments, and since the major
                            producers are non-vertically integrated, they have less flexibility than
                            elsewhere in the Arab world. At present neither the concessions nor the
                            Libyan government associates the base and the oil issues. Such an
                            association could lead to greater threat of nationalization. Libya would
                            probably retaliate by cancelling concessions. Physical attacks on
                            Americans and American property could not be ruled out. It would be
                            likely to harden, not soften, the regime's position on the base.
                            Furthermore, the Libyan government itself has been concerned about the
                            spectacular growth in offtake; it might prefer to slow the depletion of
                            a wasting and limited (twenty years at present rate of production)
                            asset.</p>
                        <p>b. Advise U.S. technicians to leave because of unsettled conditions.</p>
                        <p>PRO: If properly timed and plausible, this could have an impact on Libyan
                            regime. Libyan oil is largely <pb n="8" xml:id="d44-08" facs="d44-08"
                            />dependent on U.S., technology. In 1967 the Libyans went to great
                            lengths to retain and protect U.S. technicians.</p>
                        <p>CON: If perceived as a political act, such a move could backfire. The
                            Libyans could readily seek and obtain Eastern Bloc and other nationals
                            to operate U.S. properties—if they did not also seize the properties. It
                            is doubtful that, in such circumstances, this would moderate the regime.
                            It would unquestionably lead to great difficulties for U.S. firms
                            operating in Libya.</p>
                        <p>[The following alternatives might not be legally possible except under
                            the Trading with the Enemy Act. They are listed for completeness and in
                            the event that they should be further explored.]</p>
                        <p>c. Cut off oil imports from Libya.</p>
                        <p>PRO: This would demonstrate U.S. displeasure without as great a risk of
                            serious consequences as “a.”</p>
                        <p>CON: Since only 8 percent of Libyan oil comes to the U.S., the economic
                            effect would be minimal. Such action would provide a basis for
                            anti-American agitation without at the same time encouraging the regime
                            to greater moderation.</p>
                        <p>Place additional restrictions on U.S. investment in Libya.</p>
                        <p>PRO: This might have some effect on the expansion of U.S. investment in
                            Libya and hence induce greater moderation.</p>
                        <p>CON: It is doubtful that this would have sufficient impact to make the
                            regime substantially more tractable. U.S. companies have already shown
                            some hesitancy to expand investment because of the uncertain political
                            situation; this has had a beneficial effect on the regime's attitude. If
                            such hesitancy were given an official cast, however, the effect could be
                            the opposite. Furthermore, most oil investment in Libya has been
                            financed on the Eurodollar market.</p>
                        <p>e. Threaten to freeze Libyan reserves in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>PRO: Libya keeps $150 million in short-term securities and banknotes in
                            the U.S. A quiet threat to freeze these if legally possible would have
                            an impact and <pb n="9" xml:id="d44-09" facs="d44-09"/>might make the
                            regime more tractable.</p>
                        <p>CON: Libya would probably retaliate against U.S. interests by seizing
                            properties. The risk of such an action would seem too great to justify
                            its use solely in retaliation to the demand for base evacuation.
                            Furthermore, Libya holds so substantial a proportion of its exchange
                            reserves in dollar form only at our request and to meet our balance of
                            payments problems; under the circumstances such action would be an
                            unfortunate signal to other countries which have been responsive to
                            similar requests. The Libyan government now maintains its foreign
                            exchange reserves ($539 million in 1968) almost entirely in gold,
                            dollars and sterling. Its potential for disrupting foreign exchange
                            markets by sudden switching is not entirely negligible.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Military Action:</p>
                        <p>a. Use units of the Sixth Fleet to make a show of force off the Libyan
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>PRO: This might demonstrate to the Libyans our displeasure at recent
                            events. It would serve to underscore the importance we attach to our
                            interests in Libya.</p>
                        <p>CON: A show of force, to be effective, would have to be followed by other
                            actions; use of the Sixth Fleet in this way at the present time would
                            have serious political consequences elsewhere in the Middle East; in
                            retaliation the Libyans might invite the Soviet Mediterranean Fleet to
                            call at Libyan ports.</p>
                        <p>b. In concert with the British move sufficient troops into facilities and
                            training areas to hold these areas on grounds that we need to protect
                            lives and property. We would at the same time make pledge of
                            noninterference so long as U.S. lives and properties were not
                            disturbed.</p>
                        <p>PRO: We could do this under present agreements which permit us freedom of
                            movement of troops into our agreed areas. Placing of troops would enable
                            us to move them out to protect lives and installations elsewhere in the
                            country. It would make the regime uncertain regarding our subsequent
                            intentions and secure us full use of our facilities. Given sufficient
                            force and airlift it could provide the means for preventing mob action
                            against our people and installations, particularly away from urban
                            areas. It would give heart to our friends such as Tunisia and
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d44-10" facs="d44-10"/>
                        <p>CON: British agreement to such a scheme would be doubtful. We would have
                            difficulty in getting overflight rights from Europe (and possibly even
                            from Tunisia and Morocco) for a massive troop lift. It would undoubtedly
                            mean long-term occupation by combat forces of these facilities. We would
                            risk serious criticism from most of the rest of the world and be giving
                            away a substantial propaganda weapon. Even with forces in our facilities
                            we could not guarantee the safety of all our citizens and investments.
                            We would be undertaking drastic action for short-term gain, but
                            incurring serious longer-term costs. Finally, and under the best of
                            circumstances, we could not legally maintain troops at the facilities
                            beyond 1971.</p>
                        <p>c. If the British were not prepared to cooperate, a unilateral U.S.
                            landing at Wheelus, El Uotia (the range south of Tripoli) and Matratin
                            (U.S. Coast Guard station near the major oil fields).</p>
                        <p>PRO: This would be a feasible operation, with the same advantages as “b”
                            above.</p>
                        <p>CON: It would leave U.S. citizens and investments more exposed in eastern
                            Libya. It would leave us politically exposed. Lack of British
                            cooperation would further complicate overflight problems.</p>

                        <p>a. The following revisions are to be made in the Libya contingency
                            paper:</p>
                        <p>(1) Mention is to be made of the capabilities of the U.S. to influence
                            the Libyan Air Force and our plans to use this leverage in talks with
                            Libya about the future of Wheelus Field .</p>
                        <p>(2) A detailed scenario for [text not declassified] influencing the
                            Libyan revolutionary government is to be added.</p>
                        <p>(3) A summary of the plan for a military supported evacuation of U.S.
                            citizens from Libya is to be appended.</p>
                        <p>(4) Show of force (Option 3a) is to be deleted as a possible military
                            action.</p>

                        <p>b. With the above revisions, the Libya contingency plan constitutes a
                            fair statement of U.S. options in the present and perhaps the
                            immediately foreseeable circumstances.</p>
                        <p>c. A short briefing on Libya will be included on the agenda of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on the Middle East scheduled
                            for early December. The briefing should review the conclusions of the
                            contingency study and cover the present situation in Libya, including a
                            brief summary of our strategy in the upcoming negotiations on Wheelus
                            Field.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. LIBYA</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> opened the
                            discussion by explaining the origin of the Libya paper. The President
                            had expressed concern over the direction Libya might be taking and
                            wanted to consider what the U.S. could do to reverse the trend or to
                            indicate to the Revolutionary Government that we are not going to be
                            entirely quiescent. The President had become interested as a result of
                            his talks with moderate Arab leaders and with the Shah, who had
                            suggested transferring the Libyan oil quota to Iran.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> noted that
                            the U.S. imports so little Libyan oil that loss of the U.S. market would
                            be of small concern to Libya. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> added that existing regulations made it very
                            difficult to reallocate oil quotas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained the
                            assumptions underlying the Libya paper. The major U.S. interest in Libya
                            was considered to be oil, both because of its effect on our balance of
                            payments and because of European dependence on Libyan oil supplies. The
                            key issue was how to protect our oil interests in the context of Libyan
                            demands for withdrawal from Wheelus Air Base and our desire to reverse
                            the trend toward radicalism in Libya if at all possible. The general
                            conclusion was that U.S. options were extremely limited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said the immediate
                            problem is the Libyan demand that we leave Wheelus. We are to begin
                            talks with the Libyans on December 15. While we do not completely rule
                            out a possible change in the Libyan political climate, we do not believe
                            that the U.S. can take action to foster a political change without
                            running a serious risk of strengthening the weak revolutionary regime.
                            Under these circumstances our objective is to maintain satisfactory
                            relations with the Revolutionary Government but to hold open our other
                            options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summarized the basic
                            approach of the paper as assuming that Libya is not yet irreconcilably
                            hostile to the U.S. but that many actions which the U.S. might take
                            would turn the Revolutionary Government against us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what would
                            happen if the Revolutionary Government does become irreconcilably
                            hostile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that
                            the Libyans might nationalize U.S. oil properties. However, even were
                            that to happen, the U.S. would have little leverage. A Hickenlooper
                            situation would not arise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d45-04" facs="d45-04"/>asked if any of the measures
                            analyzed in the Libya paper might be utilized in the event oil
                            nationalization takes place. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> suggested that three such actions might be taken:
                            (1) Withdrawal of U.S. oil technicians, (2) transfer of the oil quota,
                            and (3) freezing of Libyan assets in the U.S. In addition, one other
                            possibility not mentioned in the paper would be to curtail facilities
                            for transporting Libyan oil to European markets. However, there were few
                            U.S. owned or registered vessels in this trade. Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> suggested that U.S.
                            companies might, however, cooperate with a boycott of Libyan oil
                            although if a boycott were undertaken we would be faced with the problem
                            of finding alternative oil supplies for Europe.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> noted the
                            importance of examining the consequences of loss of Libyan oil to
                            Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> added that the
                            German situation was critical because 45 percent of Libyan oil went to
                            West Germany. One oil expert had described Libya as the only
                            irreplaceable source of petroleum. This was because of the difficulty of
                            arranging alternate sources of supply. In addition, European refineries
                            were geared to Libyan oil and would require adjustments in order to
                            utilize petroleum from other sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> suggested the
                            possibility of consulting the West Germans to determine if they have
                            considered alternative supplies. In response to a question from Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> said the matter could
                            probably be raised with the Germans without danger of a leak but he
                            wondered if it were necessary to talk to the Germans at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he
                            considered the paper a fair statement of the options available in the
                            present and perhaps the immediately foreseeable circumstances. However,
                            it might be worth considering what the U.S. should do if the
                            Revolutionary regime turns hostile. It would be useful to have a
                            definition of “hostile” and to be able to present to the President the
                            steps which we might take under such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> pointed out that in the
                            event the Libyans turned hostile, another possible danger, in addition
                            to oil nationalization, would be a campaign of violence against the
                            American community in Libya. Many of the Americans are located in the
                            oil field areas. The popular mood in Libya, under the influence of
                            Nasserist propaganda, is growing less friendly. If the American
                            community were threatened, the U.S. might have to undertake a military
                            supported evacuation.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d45-05" facs="d45-05"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if there was a
                            plan for such an evacuation, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> replied that we have a plan which was tested
                            once, in 1967, when we evacuated American dependents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            analysis of possible military actions should be amplified to include the
                            possibility of military evacuation. He asked about the strategy to be
                            followed in the event of evacuation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> explained that it was planned to have U.S. forces
                            enter through Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then raised the
                            question of the military actions discussed in the present Libya paper.
                            He asked if anyone believed that the U.S. could take any of these
                            actions. He questioned the credibility of a show of force, noting that
                            this technique was effective when used by the British in the 19th
                            Century because it was known that further action would be taken in the
                            event the show of force did not get results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> thought there was
                            little likelihood of being able to take military action in Libya.
                            Insofar as British cooperation was concerned, it was clear that the
                            British had little interest in getting involved. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then instructed that Military
                            Option A (Show of Force) be dropped from the plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked about the
                            option for introducing additional forces into Wheelus. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stated that this was not
                            feasible, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if we should
                            consider sending ground forces to Libya in the event the Libyan regime
                            turned hostile. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName>
                            and Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that this depended upon
                            the purpose. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            explained that in the case of evacuation there was general agreement
                            that in extreme circumstances we would have to employ military force.
                            However, in situations other than evacuation, the use of military forces
                            appeared dubious. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>
                            noted that employment of forces in Libya could not be separated from the
                            general problem of utilizing U.S. troops in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Referring to a recent intelligence report concerning a Libyan approach to
                            the French for 300 planes, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTH1"
                                >Karamessines</persName> asked about the possibility of talking to
                            the French and enlisting their <pb n="6" xml:id="d45-06" facs="d45-06"
                            />cooperation in restricting delivery of the airplanes in the event of
                            an impending or actual nationalization. [text not declassified] Admiral
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that the Libyans had also
                            approached West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> asked what
                            our response might be if the Libyans came to us for military assistance.
                            Would we be willing to pay something in the way of military aid in order
                            to maintain a position at Wheelus? We might well be faced with this
                            question when talks about the base begin on December 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> commented that there
                            were some hints that the Libyans may wish to retain a relationship with
                            the U.S. based upon supply of military equipment and training but that
                            they would not want to continue the base relationship. The question was
                            whether it was worth maintaining the kind of presence that would be
                            possible by providing military assistance and training. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked about our present
                            assistance programs and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> explained that the U.S. provided training and
                            second echelon maintenance to the Libyan Air Force. In addition, the
                            Lockheed Company has a contract for assisting the Libyan Air Force. The
                            U.S. is selling Libya some F-5's, which are to be delivered in 1970.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that as
                            long as the Libyan question was coming before the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> it might be well to wrap up the Wheelus
                            question at that time. The principal issue was whether we wanted to go
                            to the bitter end in seeking to retain the present base agreement. We
                            would need to determine how much we would be willing to pay to retain
                            the base or some sort of military presence in Libya.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if we should
                            insist on the letter of our agreement. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> explained that in accordance with the agreement
                            each party could, beginning on December 24, 1970, terminate the
                            agreement with one year's notice. The Libyan mood is clear. They will
                            not permit resumption of training activities at the base and want the
                            U.S. to withdraw. It appears that the best we can get is one more year
                            for the U.S. presence at Wheelus but with training activities suspended.
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> added
                            that under these circumstances we would be getting about one year less
                            than provided in the agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d45-07" facs="d45-07"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether we
                            should insist on our rights under the agreement. He also asked if the
                            Libyans had the right to suspend training at the base. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that there was no right to
                            suspend training but that we have acquiesced in the Libyan request,
                            since the consequences of opposing it seemed even more undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> characterized U.S.
                            policy to date as avoiding a confrontation with the Libyans in order not
                            to risk losing U.S. oil properties. He asked what would happen when we
                            had yielded to the Libyans on the base and other military matters and
                            they then proceeded to nationalize the oil properties. He suggested that
                            we might perhaps adopt a somewhat tougher negotiating stance although he
                            did not want to suggest that we hold to the base agreement to the bitter
                            end. It would seem, however, that if we were too nice to the Libyans, we
                            might only entrench the revolutionary regime more firmly.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that unarmed aircraft are
                            still operating in and out of Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that we had
                            assumed for a long time that when the King left the scene, pressures on
                            us to withdraw from Wheelus would arise. In fact, moves for U.S.
                            withdrawal had come up twice in the past, and we had managed to retain
                            the base only by burying the issue after months of negotiations. It
                            seemed hard to conceive that a future Libyan Government would permit
                            resumption of training or would allow the agreement to run its course.
                            Another problem was the fact that the U.S. aircraft stationed at Wheelus
                            were Phantoms, which are embarrassing to the Government of Libya because
                            this type of aircraft is associated with U.S. assistance to Israel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> continued that if the
                            political orientation of the Libyan Government should shift, we might be
                            able to continue limited training at Wheelus. Our present strategy,
                            looking to the talks scheduled to begin December 15, is to lay the
                            alternatives before the Libyans, state our willingness to withdraw and
                            point out the complexities that would arise with regard to maintaining
                            the Libyan Air Force after a U.S. departure. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> again observed that the Libyan
                            problem could not be separated from our overall problem in the Middle
                            East.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the Libyan
                            problem would be discussed at a <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            meeting covering the whole Middle East situation. A few minutes would be
                            allowed at the start of the meeting for a briefing to familiarize the
                            principals with our present position with regard to Libya. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> noted that he would be out of
                            the country at the time of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            meeting, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and
                            Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> agreed
                            that <persName>Johnson</persName> would arrange for a suitable person to
                            brief the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on Libya. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> directed that the briefing
                            include a discussion of the problems we face with regard to Wheelus. It
                            should outline the present situation and describe what we propose to do
                            in response to Libyan pressures for withdrawal.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the

                            He suggested that such a finding might create a certain restiveness if

                        <p>Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> said that he agreed and that because
                            of his concern that we ought not to be completely negative, he had asked
                            his staff to prepare a paper on possible actions that might be taken. He
                            distributed copies of the paper to members of the group [text not

                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA2">Johnson</persName> said that
                            we were planning to use our leverage with the Air Force in the
                            forthcoming negotiations about Wheelus. Admiral
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> replied that the most immediate U.S.
                            problem was the status of Wheelus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> commented that there had been no attempt to focus
                            on the Wheelus problem in the contingency paper because it was generally
                            agreed that the base was secondary to our oil interests.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> reiterated that he believed there
                            were some small actions that we might take. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Johnson</persName> thought that everything was not as
                            black and white as the contingency paper suggested. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that officials at Wheelus
                            were trying to keep in touch with Libyan Air Force officers and to get
                            them to explain to the Army the possible problems that might arise if
                            the U.S. withdrew from Wheelus. He cautioned, however, against
                            overreliance on our leverage with the Libyan military and characterized
                            the revolutionary government as having two tendencies — pro Libyan and
                            pro Arab. There followed a brief discussion about the relative obscurity
                            of the leaders of the revolutionary government and the circumstances
                            that permitted them to take power when they did.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked Admiral
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> if his proposal was in effect to expand
                            the discussion of Option 4.d., [text not declassified] Admiral
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed and said that he thought the
                            paper should also note other small actions, such as those being used in
                            the Wheelus negotiations, which we can take to protect our interests in
                            Libya. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s question, the members of the group said they
                            had no objection to making these changes in the paper. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the President would
                            probably wish to know about some of these actions and that he was averse
                            to giving the President a paper in which every possible action was
                            described as not feasible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> observed that the
                            Administration seemed resigned to the fact that we would lose Wheelus
                            sooner or later. Thus, the main question was to determine under what
                            conditions and with what kind of a posture the U.S. would withdraw. If
                            the U.S. were too tough, a bad situation might develop in Libya. On the
                            other hand, if we were too compliant, the consequences might also be
                            bad. He wondered if appeasement would be effective in saving the oil
                            properties and observed that the Libyans needed to have some motive for
                            wanting to have a U.S. presence in their country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> observed that we had
                            retained the base heretofore in large measure because the King thought
                            that it might offer a form of protection to him and to his family.
                            Because of the general situation in the Middle East, the U.S. is not
                            liked in Libya. Our real choice is between attempting to reverse the
                            anti-U.S. conditioning of the Libyan populace or seeking with all
                            deliberate speed to negotiate our differences in such a manner as to
                            leave our options open — but to avoid a confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned against
                            proposing to the President anything which the members of the WSAG did
                            not believe was feasible. He considered that the WSAG had made a good
                            assessment of the Libyan problem and that the paper did notjequire
                            change except for the marginal matters discussed earlier, [text not

                            ARE TOO VAGUE TO JUSTIFY OFFICIAL REACTION. IF, HOWEVER, ALLEGATIONS

                        <p>I gather you told <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName>
                            that you wanted to clear the negotiating instructions on Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>As you know, State and Defense tried for a week to get us to break the
                            negotiating deadlock between them. We stood aside, and they have now
                            come to terms with each other.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> has sent the resulting cable
                            under the attached note (Tab A). I have described it in a possible
                            information memo to the President. He has asked for clearance by Friday,
                            December 12.</p>
                        <p>I have written the attached memo to the President for his information. It
                            does not seem to me that negotiating tactics on something like this are
                            a subject he should be bothered with.</p>
                        <p>On the tactics themselves, I believe we should now let State and Defense
                            continue to haggle this out and just go along with their compromise.</p>

                        <p>1. General Considerations. Libyan political situation unstable and
                            susceptible of change in directions we cannot anticipate on basis
                            present information. We wish to avoid actions which would strengthen
                            hand of such elements of <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as may be
                            pro-UAR or to give <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> valuable
                            political issue just prior Arab Summit or mini-Summit to follow in
                            Tripoli. We also wish to avoid impression of quick submission to <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> demands for withdrawal from agreed
                            areas which might affect our base structure elsewhere. We will require
                            from <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> the conditions precedent to
                            an orderly withdrawal. At this point we see little possibility
                            resumption interim training but wish hold out possibility of resuming
                                <gloss target="#t_WTD1">WTD</gloss> training on reduced scale in
                            post-withdrawal arrangement which would include continuing relationship
                                <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss>. Finally, we will be
                            negotiating <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> demands for our
                            withdrawal in the context of preserving other major interests in
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>2. Strategy. Initial Libyan position will be to require from us a firm
                            date for our withdrawal as a condition for discussion of any other
                            subjects. We hope, however, at some point focus <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d47-04" facs="d47-04"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> attention on ongoing utility of
                            Wheelus to Libyan military.</p>
                        <p>3. In this context, we believe Ambassador's opening statement should be
                            keyed to explaining serious problems both sides will face in precipitous
                            withdrawal. We desire also emphasize fact base relationship has benefits
                            Libya as well which we hope will be considered in context negotiations.
                            He may affirm that we have begun to phase down at base (e.g., withdrawal
                            of critical WRM) and that we will be continuing this process (e.g.,
                            Harvest Eagle, Sites 4 &amp; 6, etc.). He should remind <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> negotiators that present Agreement
                            provides for one-yeare period of notice of intent to terminate its
                            provisions; that this period set advisedly in light complexities of
                            phasing down complex installation; that assuming satisfactory agreement
                            can be reached and carried out on withdrawal arrangements we undertake
                            to complete withdrawal process within that time frame.</p>
                        <p>4. If, as we anticipate, <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>
                            negotiators state that this is not acceptable, Ambassador should stress
                            that orderly withdrawal from base depends on full cooperation both sides
                            including <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> willingness to cooperate
                            on customs, immigration, base security, introduction of TDY personnel
                            and general freedom from harassment or abuse. We desire stress insofar
                            as possible complexity problems to be faced. For example we will require
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> agreement to assume existing
                            real estate leases in toto and to accept responsibility for any claims
                            arising therefrom. Without full examination these issues we cannot be
                            more specific about time frame within which withdrawal would be
                            physically <pb n="5" xml:id="d47-05" facs="d47-05"/>possible.
                            Accordingly, we should insist on creation subcommittees which would set
                            parameters for <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> cooperation. You
                            may suggest that it should not take long for subcommittees to define
                            cooperation we require and propose that they be directed to report back
                            to principal negotiators within one week (or any other agreed period).
                            You may indicate that if their reports meet our requirements, we would
                            thereafter be willing to set a planning date for our final withdrawal.
                            In this regard, we will not rpt not entertain probable <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> suggestion (made to British) that we
                            withdraw military personnel immediately and leave to <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> the processing of civilians,
                            dependents and “equipment.”</p>
                        <p>5. If <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> raises subject of equipment
                            on base and indicates desire for some or all thereof, Ambassador should
                            indicate that we are not rpt not now prepared to discuss this subject;
                            that important items will be required to equip training facilities we
                            must establish elsewhere; that there are strict legal requirements for
                            disposal of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> property, including
                            requirement to survey it in light needs other <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> agencies. Surveys will require time, without which we
                            will be required to withdraw all non-permanent constructions for
                            subsequent survey and disposal.</p>
                        <p>6. We would hope that after initial, expected rhetoric and some
                            bargaining on subject of specific date during first few sessions,
                            implications precipitous withdrawal for its interests would become
                            clearer to <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. At that point we can
                            indicate our willingness to enter into discussions of property we will
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="d47-06" facs="d47-06"/>be able to dispose of to
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> if time is available to us to
                            meet our own legal requirements. In this context we should sound <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> intentions re future uses to which
                            base will be put by <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. We will then
                            face a decision as to training and other assistance they may wish from
                            us and/or others. If our decision is affirmative, we would hope to lead
                            LARG on into examination of relationship between <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> presence and our ability to provide
                            training and other services <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> may
                            require. It is in this context that we should raise subject of
                            post-withdrawal training arrangement.</p>
                        <p>7. [text not declassfied]</p>
                        <p>8. US Requirements. To maintain maximum control of agreed areas we will
                            require, and should insist on, continued validity of present Agreement
                            until all personnel and operations thereunder have been withdrawn or
                            ceased. This will, for example, entail substantial relaxation of present
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> customs controls. More
                            importantly from point of view of preventing potentially serious
                            incidents, it will entail reversion of base security (including both
                            gates) to effective US contol; indeed, we should make maximum effort to
                            this end, even though it may mean denying entry to base of non-official
                            Americans (other than school children) or exit from base of all
                            personnel who are not on official duty strictly defined.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Tripoli reports that agreement has been reached with the
                            Libyans on a US withdrawal date from Wheelus (June 30, 1970) and on the
                            arrangements designed to assure that the American withdrawal is
                            dignified. Although the Libyans have proved to be hard bargainers, the
                            atmosphere of the talks has remained cordial. An agreed minute is
                            expected to be signed at 8:00 p.m., Tripoli time (1:00 p.m., our time)
                            December 23.</p>
                        <p>Signing of the minute may coincide with the arrival of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in Tripoli as a guest of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> visit, which is expected to last
                            for two days, may also result in an announcement of closer
                            Libyan-Egyptian political or military cooperation, perhaps extending to
                            Sudan. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s presence may also
                            surface the fact that Egyptian troops, approximately 1,000, have been in
                            Libya for about a week.</p>
                        <p>This combination of events may provoke domestic criticism of the
                            Department for having agreed to negotiate for a US withdrawal from
                            Wheelus at this particular time. If such criticism arises, the following
                            replies may reasonably be made:</p>
                        <p>(1) The continued US presence at Wheelus, long after the conclusion of
                            World War II, has been an increasing source of irritation in US-Libyan
                            relations for several years. The new regime's request for a US
                            withdrawal undoubtedly reflects significant Libyan popular feeling.</p>
                        <p>(2) The US wishes to establish with the new Libyan regime a basis for
                            longer-term friendly relationships. A refusal to negotiate on the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'s request that we withdraw would
                            frustrate attainment of that objective.</p>
                        <p>(3) We saw no political advantage in delaying a negotiation on this
                            problem; so far as we can determine, the present regime is the one with
                            which we will have to deal over the foreseeable future. The British, who
                            also agreed to negotiate <pb n="2" xml:id="d49-02" facs="d49-02"/>on
                            their Base, and to withdraw by March 31, 1970, are of the same
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>(4) The British decision to withdraw by March 31, 1970, obviously made
                            more difficult any US “hold-out” on Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>Because we recognize the legitimate concerns regarding the use to which
                            the Base might be put once we withdraw, we are asking Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to express these
                            concerns to Captain Jaluud, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            member who leads the Libyan negotiating team. Hopefully, Jaluud will
                            indicate to the Ambassador that the Base will not be transferred to the
                            control of any third country after the US forces leave.</p>

                        <p>This estimate assesses likely developments in Libyan policy, particularly
                            with regard to issues affecting US interests. Most of the judgments are
                            intended to apply only to the next six months or so, although a few
                            longer term trends also are indicated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The young captains and lieutenants who took over Libya four months ago
                            want foreign military installations removed from Libya as soon as
                            possible. Evacuation of the bases in a manner satisfactory to the
                            Libyans will not guarantee good relations between Libya and the US, but
                            any other outcome would seriously prejudice US interests. The members of
                            the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>)
                            are also clearly determined to identify with the militant Arab line
                            toward Israel. In these two desires, they reflect the prevailing mood in
                            Libya itself, and any successor regime probably would follow similar
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>B. Beyond this, we know little concerning the policies of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, and there seem to be potential sources
                            of dissension within the group. Unsure of its own hold on power and
                            lacking clear domestic policy objectives, it will be disposed to look
                            for advice to other Arab countries—especially Egypt, with which the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> leaders are developing close
                            ties.</p>
                        <p>C. Oil operations in Libya netted the US balance of payments over $800
                            million in 1968; for 1969, that figure probably will approximate $750
                            million. Libya received $952 million in oil revenues in 1968 and will
                            receive about $1.3 billion in 1969. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> will press vigorously, and successfully, to increase
                            its income from oil. Nationalization of oil production does not seem
                            likely, but it cannot be entirely <pb n="3" xml:id="d50-03"
                                facs="d50-03"/>ruled out, in dealing with the oil companies, Libya
                            holds a number of high cards.</p>
                        <p>D. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably will contribute
                            financially to the Arab cause even more heavily than did the monarchy.
                            It also may station token contingents of troops in Egypt and perhaps
                            Jordan. If Egypt so desired, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            probably would agree to make Libyan airfields available to Egyptian
                            aircraft. Over the longer run, it is possible that Soviet-manned
                            reconnaissance aircraft in some guise might be permitted access to
                            facilities in Libya. (1) Properly requested and conducted over flights
                            and port visits by the Soviets would almost certainly be permitted; we
                            doubt, however, that the Libyans would give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> access to military installations in Libya on anything
                            like extraterritorial terms.</p>
                        <p>(1) The circumstances under which such a contingency might arise will be
                            more fully explored in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11-6-70,

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>1. The United Kingdom of Libya lasted almost 18 years. In this period, it
                            passed from being one of the poorest nations in the world, heavily
                            dependent on subsidies from the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>, to the role of a major, wealthy oil producer. The policies
                            of the monarchy were established almost entirely by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>. Recognizing the value of British
                            support since the days when the British freed Libya from Italian
                            domination and the importance of the US aid that kept the Kingdom
                            solvent in its early years, <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>
                            was willing and able to stand fast against the growing tide of Libyan
                            enthusiasm for the Arab cause against Israel and to risk the opprobrium
                            associated with foreign military installations on Libyan soil. In
                            September 1969, however, the royal regime was suddenly overthrown by a
                            group of young army officers directed by a Revolutionary Command Council
                                (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. THE NATURE AND STABILITY OF THE NEW
                            REGIME</p>
                        <p>2. The real power in the new regime resides in the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> has not given any meaningful responsibility to the
                            civilian ministers it has appointed, and there is very little trust or
                            sympathy between the military and civilian components of the government.
                            The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members lack both the expertise
                            and the machinery for making and implementing decisions in an orderly
                            way—a circumstance which is likely to become more obvious and
                            troublesome with time. Available information indicates that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is a collegial group of about <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d50-04" facs="d50-04"/>a dozen members, virtually all
                            between the ages of 25 and 30. Most of them attended the Libyan Royal
                            Military Academy together, graduating in 1965 and 1966, and most have
                            attended military courses in the US and/or the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. Information on the internal functioning of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and of relative standing within the
                            group is extremely scanty. Its president, Colonel Muammar Qadhaafi,
                            apparently is at present the most powerful individual although not the
                            sole source of authority. The leaders appear to have the active support
                            of a larger group of adherents, numbering 50 to 100 officers (10-20
                            percent of the total officer strength of the Libyan Armed Forces).</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has not so far been challenged
                            from outside its own ranks. There is considerable grousing and
                            criticism, and those who have lost power and status as a result of the
                            coup undoubtedly are unhappy. However, most of the prominent
                            personalities of the old regime are in exile or under detention. Most of
                            those who have thus far escaped the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>s
                            ire are likely to remain quiescent. There have been some reports of
                            efforts by old regime figures to promote resistance activities among the
                            broadly pro-royalist Cyrenaican tribes, but it appears unlikely that
                            these elements will pose a serious challenge to the new regime in the
                            near future. Since the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> disarmed or
                            otherwise neutralized all security forces outside the regular army, the
                            potential for active opposition from these quarters also appears low for
                            some time to come.</p>
                        <p>4. While individual members may hold particular philosophies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> does not yet appear to have a clear and
                            agreed program beyond the negative one of expunging what its members
                            consider offensive features of the previous regime. Domestically, they
                            seem bent on eradicating corruption and social inequities. In external
                            matters, they are determined to eliminate the Western military presence
                            symbolized primarily by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases at
                            Tobruk and El Adem and the US base at Wheelus. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s actions so far have underlined both
                            the Libyan and the Arab character of the revolution. The regime speeded
                            up the Libyanization of foreign-owned banks which had begun under the
                            monarchy. It introduced partial prohibition, presumably out of deference
                            to Islamic fundamentalism. It removed foreign-language signs and deleted
                            English language courses from the school curriculum. It carried out
                            widespread arrests of politicians, businessmen, and senior military
                            personnel associated with the old regime, and preparations for a series
                            of show trials are underway.</p>
                        <p>5. At the start, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> was clearly
                            fearful of military intervention by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and the US in behalf of <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName>. As soon as it felt that this immediate threat had
                            passed, the regime announced that it wanted foreign military
                            installations removed from Libyan soil as quickly as possible.
                            Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> remains
                            apprehensive of direct Western intervention, and it is clearly worried
                            about potential domestic challenge. These concerns, combined with a
                            desire to solidify Libyan ties with the Arab community, lie behind some
                            recent Libyan moves on the Arab stage. Shortly after the revolution, the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> brought in about 150 Egyptian
                            civilian advisors and an equal number of military ones; they are <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d50-05" facs="d50-05"/>particularly noticeable in the
                            security and information fields. In mid-December, two battalions of
                            Egyptian troops were brought to Libya.</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has also endorsed proposals
                            for closer association among Sudan, Egypt, and Libya and has sometimes
                            referred to itself as the Committee of Free Unionist Officers. There is
                            a considerable bond between Libya and Egypt, based on longstanding
                            social, cultural, and educational links. Moreover, any group of
                            revolutionary young Arab officers cannot help but look upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a successful model.
                            Nevertheless, we are inclined to believe that the emphasis in any
                            association will be on military and economic cooperation well short of
                            complete union. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, for his
                            part, would find even a very loose association a useful means of
                            exerting influence over the inexperienced <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>7. There are many in Libya, however, who neither like nor trust
                            Egyptians. Many Libyans fear that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> intends steps which would put Libya's 1.8 million
                            people and huge oil revenues under Cairo's control. Indeed, the first
                            split in the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> occurred ostensibly
                            because Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_HHAS1">HAWAAZ</persName>
                            opposed QADHAAFI's moves toward Egypt, and the subsequent arrival of
                            Egyptian troops in Libya offer grounds for future opposition to the
                            QADHAAFI regime. We cannot say, given present skimpy evidence, whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> and its supporters will be able
                            to overcome future divisiveness within their own ranks. Such matters as
                            relations with Egypt, personal ambition, and opportunities for

                        <p>8. If the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> hangs together, it is
                            likely to be able to maintain power for some time. Any challenge from
                            outside will be slow to develop, and the military holds the power in the
                            country. Under <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> rule, a general
                            breakdown of internal stability that would threaten foreign citizens and
                            foreign-owned property is not likely, although occasional localized
                            disruptions are possible. If a part of the present <gloss

                            group of officers should move in, the odds are that a successor
                            government would pursue domestic and Arab policies not greatly
                            dissimilar to those of the present regime.</p>

                        <p>8. Many of the important issues facing the inexperienced young <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members involve Western interests; in
                            view of the strong urge the regime has for national independence and
                            sovereignty, this foreign involvement will be a major factor in decision
                            making. The most obvious manifestations of foreign influence, of course,
                            are the military installations; on this issue, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has already been able to reach a firm,
                            and we believe irrevocable, decision. Oil concession agreements, foreign
                            involvement in corruption charges against old regime figures, arms
                            procurement, Libya's role in the Arab-Israeli quarrel, and economic
                            management are far more complex questions. For the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members, the proper handling of these
                            issues is vital to their own ability to maintain order and continue
                            themselves in power. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> approach
                            is, moreover, the key <pb n="6" xml:id="d50-06" facs="d50-06"/>to the
                            continued existence of a Western-owned oil industry and to the safety of

                        <p>10. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> will be closely monitoring
                            the adherence of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to agreed
                            schedules for the removal of forces from Libya. This will be extremely
                            important to the future of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            itself as well as to the course of Libyan relations with both countries.
                            US control over Wheelus Air Base, the British garrison at Tobruk, and
                            British control over El Adem Air Base are anathema to the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> for a number of reasons. The 6,000 US
                            and British military personnel in the country at the time of the
                            revolution were seen by the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as a
                            potential threat to Libya, whose armed forces numbered only about 8,000.
                            The bases are a highly visible reminder of Libyan dependence on foreign
                            tutelage and a negation of Libyan and Arab nationalism. Moreover,
                            evacuation is a clear and simple goal, while the task of governing the
                            country is proving to be complicated and difficult.</p>
                        <p>11. Domestic criticism at the absence of bold new initiatives toward the
                            reforms the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has promised has already
                            appeared. In such circumstances, evacuation of the bases and distraction
                            of the public by corruption trials are very important to the regime,
                            which will need some political triumphs in the months ahead. Evacuation
                            of the bases in a manner satisfactory to the Libyans will not guarantee
                            good relations with the US, but any other outcome would seriously
                            prejudice US interests.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Oil Policy</p>
                        <p>12. Upon its accession to power, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            announced that it would honor all existing international
                            commitments-specifically including oil concessions. It also pledged to
                            punish all those guilty of flagrant corruption under the monarchy. The
                            two promises are not wholly compatible, since many existing oil
                            concessions—as well as other commercial agreements—were obtained by
                            influence-peddling and bribery involving both highly placed Libyans and
                            foreign individuals and corporations. The corruption trials are slated
                            to begin soon, and any oil companies publicly named in the trials could
                            be an early target for punitive actions.</p>
                        <p>13. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is unlikely to
                            take such action against the nine current oil producers.(See Table.) Oil
                            production is a source of huge revenues ($952 million in 1968 and an
                            estimated $1.3 billion in 1969) which the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> wishes to retain. Moreover, the major corruption
                            charges revolve around concession awards made in 1966 and 1969 to a
                            number of companies, most of which are not yet producing. Most currently
                            producing companies had obtained concessions earlier and could be
                            omitted from the proceedings.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d50-07" facs="d50-07"/>
                        <p>[TABLE: CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IN LIBYA]</p>
                        <p>14. In any event, the producing companies will be under pressure from the
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> for higher payments to the
                            Libyan Government. Libya received just over $1 per barrel in 1967 and
                            1968—a higher payment than any major producing country except Venezuela
                            and about 15c per barrel more than Persian Gulf producers. But Libyan
                            oil has an unusually favorable combination of characteristics. It can be
                            delivered to Europe by tanker in only six days, whereas most Persian
                            Gulf oil is 35 to 40 days away from Europe so long as the Suez Canal
                            remains closed. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for high priced
                            products such as gasoline and naphtha, and it has almost no
                            sulphur—making it exceptionally low in air pollutants. Libya can play
                            off some producing companies against others. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> will probably push vigorously the Idris regime's demand
                            for an upward revision of the price structure on which Libyan revenues
                            are correlated. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is also likely
                            to be much more adamant than the monarchy about pressing for increased
                            government control of oil field operations and for participation by the
                            government-owned Libyan Petroleum Company.</p>
                        <p>15. A Libyan attempt to nationalize oil production does not appear
                            likely, particularly in the coming months when the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is trying to learn its job and
                            consolidate its control. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out,
                            especially in the event of major Arab-Israeli military hostilities. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is deeply committed to the Arab
                            cause, and oil is the major weapon at Libyan disposal. Moreover, Libya
                            is in a unique position to carry out nationalization without severe
                            damage to itself. The principal bar to nationalization has historically
                            been domination of the oil trade and markets by the seven major
                            international oil companies; their share of the world market, however,
                            has dropped from abut 90 percent in 1959 to some 75 percent in 1968, and
                            they <pb n="8" xml:id="d50-08" facs="d50-08"/>produce only about half of
                            Libya's total output. West European countries depend greatly on Libyan
                            oil. Twenty-five percent of the crude oil imported in 1968 by the
                            European Common Market countries—and 43 percent of West German
                            imports—came from Libya. If suppliers could not meet their contractual
                            deliveries, independent oil companies in importing countries would
                            probably not refuse to buy oil from nationalized companies, as long as
                            the price remained competitive. Furthermore, Libya has accumulated
                            foreign exchange reserves adequate to ride out a lengthy period during
                            which it could seek new customers; imports other than oil field
                            equipment could be maintained at current levels for roughly two years
                            with the funds Libya now has on hand.</p>
                        <p>16. For the US, the impact of Libyan oil policy will be reflected
                            principally in the balance of payments. By the end of 1968, American oil
                            companies had invested about $1.2 billion in Libya and had repatriated
                            profits totaling over $1.5 billion, The profit inflow was $478 million
                            in 1968 and probably will amount to about $600 million in 1969. In
                            addition, oil company purchases of equipment accounted for over $140
                            million out of a net inflow to the US of some $205 million from trade
                            and other transactions with Libya in 1968. The effect of Libyan pressure
                            for an increasing share in total oil earnings will be to somewhat retard
                            the rapid growth of the profit flow, which has doubled in the past two
                            years. Should American oil interests in Libya be nationalized,
                            compensation even at the full total of cumulative investment would be
                            equivalent to only two years' profit remittances at the current rate.
                            Compensation at the declared book value of $700 million would be
                            equivalent to profit remittances for only about one year. In case of
                            nationalization, the balance of payments impact on the US would be
                            somewhat offset by increased production and profits from
                            American-operated concessions in other producing countries.</p>

                        <p>17. The Libyan regime is seeking arms. It almost certainly will want
                            tanks and aircraft, probably in quantities at least as great as those
                            the Idris regime was considering. The new regime has not withdrawn
                            requests made by the monarchy for Chieftain tanks from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and jet fighters from the US, and it
                            probably will continue to look to Washington and London for major items.
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has already shown its
                            interest in diversifying sources of military support by contacting
                            France and other Western countries about the prospects for both arms and
                            training assistance. In some of these contacts, Libya may be acting as
                            an intermediary for other Arab states. With cash available to purchase
                            whatever it wants, Libya is in an excellent position. If it cannot
                            satisfy its desires in the West, we do not think it would be
                            particularly reluctant to turn to the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>18. The Libyans have stated that they mean to use Wheelus as a military
                            airfield, but they will certainly not require the full extent of its
                            facilities. To <pb n="9" xml:id="d50-09" facs="d50-09"/>operate what
                            they do need, they may choose to hire civilian contractors. In line with
                            their desire to escape from predominant US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> tutelage, they might turn to German or French sources
                            for assistance. It is more likely, however, that they will request help
                            from Egypt, which is capable of providing military or civilian
                            technicians to run Wheelus at the level the Libyans will require.</p>
                        <p>19. If the Egyptians desire, the Libyans also would probably agree to
                            Egyptian use of either Wheelus or El Adem as dispersal fields for
                            Egyptian aircraft. From the Egyptian point of view, this would be
                            somewhat more convenient than the present practice of using fields in
                            Algeria and Sudan. For Egyptian purposes, El Adem is more conveniently
                            located than Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>20. To date, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has shown no
                            inclination to cultivate strong links with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Soviet diplomats have complained about difficulties
                            in gaining access to members of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            and about harassments by low ranking Libyan military personnel. A Soviet
                            offer of military assistance made in the days immediately after the
                            revolution was rejected. We doubt that the Libyans would see political
                            benefits in an arrangement giving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> access to either Wheelus Air Base or the British
                            facilities at Tobruk and El Adem on anything like extraterritorial terms
                            at such time as these are evacuated. Foreign bases, per se, are a
                            favorite target for Arab condemnation. On the other hand, the Libyans
                            would almost certainly be willing to grant the Soviets over flight and
                            landing rights and port visits as long as they were requested and
                            conducted in accordance with normal procedures. Over the longer run, it
                            is possible that Soviet-manned reconnaissance aircraft in some guise
                            (e.g., under Egyptian markings) might be permitted access to facilities

                        <p>21. The new regime in Libya clearly is determined to identify itself with
                            the militant Arab line toward Israel. Its principal weapon is money, and
                            it probably will be more generous than the monarchy. Payments pledged by
                            the monarchy included annual subsidies of $59 million to Egypt and $25
                            million to Jordan agreed to at Khartoum in 1967. Of a further $58
                            million promised to Egypt by <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName> in 1969, no more than half had been paid at the
                            time of the coup. Additional amounts for Egypt and Jordan are likely,
                            along with increased payments to fedayeen organizations; Libya
                            apparently made some new pledges at the Rabat conference in December
                            1969, but the exact amounts are not yet known. The <gloss

                            and perhaps Jordan. These, however, will almost certainly be little more
                            than token contingents.</p>

                        <p>1. I WAS INFORMED BY <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FONOFF</gloss> YESTERDAY
                            MORNING THAT AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME WITH QADHAAFI AND BWAYSIIR HAD BEEN
                            ARRANGED FOR 1315 SAME DAY. AS DEPT AWARE, I ALREADY HAD SEPARATE
                            PENDING REQUESTS TO SEE <persName corresp="#p_JJJAS1">JALLUUD</persName>
                            ON MILITARY RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS AND BWAYSIIR ON MOST RECENT EXPULSION
                            CASE AND OTHER MATTERS. I THEREFORE ASSUMED THAT MEETING PROBABLY GREW
                            OUT OF THESE REQUESTS. HOWEVER, IT BECAME CLEAR ON ARRIVAL THAT THIS WAS
                            QADHAAFI'S INITIATIVE AND RELATED PRIMARILY TO F-5 PROGRAM. GENERAL
                            ATMOSPHERE WAS CORDIAL BUT MEETING LESS THAN SATISFACTORY IN THAT
                            QADHAAFI OBVIOUSLY UNPREPARED ON VARIDUS SUBJECTS I RAISED AND ALSO
                            PRESSED FOR TIME, RECEIVING ME LATE AND WITH OTHER APPOINTMENTS WAITING
                            FOR HIM. NEVERTHELESS, I BELIEVE WE SUCCEEDED IN LAYING SOME BASIC
                            PROBLEMS OUT ON TABLE AND RECEIVING SOME INDICATIONS OF <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> VIEWS THAT MAY BE USEFUL.</p>
                        <p>2. AFTER OPENING PLEASANTRIES, QADHAAFI ASKED ME HOW EVACUATION <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d51-02" facs="d51-02"/>PROCEEDING. I GAVE BRIEF RUNDOWN AND
                            EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>
                            COOPERATION WE RECEIVING. QADHAAFI EXPRESSED PLEASURE AND THEN RAISED
                            MATTER OF SCHEDULED DELIVERY OF EIGHT F-5'S, STATING THAT US REFUSAL TO
                            PROVIDE <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> WITH AMMUNITION FROM
                            STOCKS AT WHEELUS WAS AN OBSTACLE TO COMPLETION OF THIS DEAL. MILITARY
                            AIRCRAFT WITHOUT AMMUNITION USELESS.</p>
                        <p>3. I REPLIED THAT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A MISUNDERSTANDING RE US POSITION
                            ON THIS MATTER. I THEN CAREFULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM, AS WE HAVE WITH
                            NUMEROUS OTHER <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> OFFICIALS, STATUS
                            OF WRM AND REASONS WHY WE COULD NOT DEPLETE IT, AT SAME TIME, I MADE
                            CLEAR TO HIM THAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONTINUES TO BE
                            READY TO CONSIDER REQUEST FOR AMMUNITION THROUGH <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> CHANNELS. IN FACT, <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> HAS BEEN WAITING SOME MONTHS FOR
                                <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss>'S NORMAL REQUESTS BUT THESE
                            HAVE NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING. WE HAVE NOT SAID THAT WE WILL NOT HONOR
                            REQUESTS FOR AMMUNITION; WE HAVE MERELY SAID THAT SUCH REQUESTS MUST BE
                            MADE THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS FOR SUPPLY FROM NORMAL SUPPLY SOURCES.</p>
                        <p>4. I CONTINUED BY EMPHASIZING NEED TO CLARIFY <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss>'S THINKING RE FUTURE OF US-LIBYAN RELATIONSHIP IN
                            MILITARY FIELD,POINTING OUT THAT, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, PRESENT
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> SUPPORT FOR LARAF IS LARGELY
                            BASED ON EXISTENCE OF WHEELUS. DEPARTURE OF BLUE SUITERS WILL REQUIRE
                            NEW ARRANGEMENTS WHICH SHOULD BE MADE QUICKLY. <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> SHOULD BE FULLY AWARE OF THIS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE
                            NECESSARY STEPS. I THEN EXPLAINED ROLE OF NORAIR IN PROVIDING FLIGHT
                            LINE MAINTENANCE FOR F-5'S INCLUDING FACT THAT CONTRACT ASSUMES
                            AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN SUPPORT FUNCTIONS NOW SUPPLIED BY WHEELUS AND
                            WILL HAVE TO BE REVISED IF <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> INTENDS
                            RETAIN NORAIR. IF THIS CASE, <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> MIGHT
                            ALSO WISH CONSIDER EXTENDING CONTRACT TO COVER OTHER SERVICES PRESENTLY
                            PROVIDED BY <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. TURNING TO <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, I RAISED QUESTION OF
                            ARMY SECTION, EMPHASIZING THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 1 IT HAS SCARCELY BEEN
                            UTILIZED. THIS WOULD APPEAR TO PLACE IN DOUBT ITS FUTURE USEFULNESS, BUT
                            WE WISH CLARIFY <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> THINKING ON THIS
                            QUESTION. AF SECTION BY CONTRAST CONTINUES TO WORK WITH <gloss
                                target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'S VIEWS RE ITS FUTURE UNDER NEW
                            RELATIONSHIP WHICH MUST BE WORKED OUT.</p>
                        <p>6. QADHAAFI ACKNOWLEDGED SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY <gloss
                                target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> SECTION <pb n="3" xml:id="d51-03"
                                facs="d51-03"/>AND EXPRESSED DESIRE TO CONTINUE SUCH COOPERATION.
                            THESE FUNCTIONS WOULD CONTINUE AS USUAL UNTIL EVACUATION COMPLETED.
                            THEREAFTER, FOUNDATIONS FOR NEW RELATION COULD BE LAID. SO LONG AS US
                            AIRCRAFT IN USE, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO HAVE ASSISTANCE OF AMERICAN
                            EXPERTISE.</p>
                        <p>7. REVERTING TO AMMO QUESTION, QADHAAFI STRESSED THAT ANY COUNTRY
                            PROVIDING WEAPONS ASSISTANCE HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPLY AMMO. HE SAID
                            COS HAD REPORTED TO HIM THAT US AUTHORITIES HAD PREDICTED THAT RESPONSE
                            TO REQUEST THROUGH <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> FOR AMMO MIGHT
                            TAKE UP TO A YEAR. THIS WAS ASTONISHING. ORDINARY REQUESTS FOR AMMO AND
                            SPARE PARTS MUST BE MET ON AN URGENT BASIS.</p>
                        <p>8. I SAID ONCE AGAIN THAT QADHAAFI'S INFORMATION SEEMED TO BE BASED ON
                            MISUNDERSTANDING. RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FOR AMMO WOULD CERTAINLY BE
                            FORTHCOMING IN MUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME THAN ONE YEAR. NATURALLY,
                            HOWEVER, LEAD TIME WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR PURCHASES. THERE WAS REALLY NO
                            PROBLEM IN OBTAINING NECESSARY DECISION IF <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss> WILL SIT DOWN WITH <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> TO DISCUSS MATTER. SUCH WORKING LEVEL CONTACTS NOW
                            TAKING PLACE AND HOPEFULLY MATTER WILL SOON BE RESOLVED.</p>
                        <p>9. REVERTING TO QUESTION OF F-5'S, I ASKED QADHAAFI WHETHER I WOULD RE
                            CORRECT IN DESCRIBING HIS POSITION AS FOLLOWS, QTE THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> CONTINUES TD DESIRE PURCHASE EIGHT
                            ADDITIONAL F-5'S IF IT CAN RECEIVE AMMO AND SPARE PARTS UNQTE. QADHAAFI
                            REPLIED CITE WE WILL BUY THE AIRCRAFT IF WE ARE GUARANTEED AVAILABILITY
                            OF AMMO AND SPARE PARTS WITHOUT COMPLICATION AND DELAY UNQTE.</p>
                        <p>10. I THEN REVERTED TO QADHAAFI'S ASSUMPTIONS THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> SUPPORT FOR <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss> WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL COMPLETION OF EVACUATION AND
                            THAT NEW ARRANGEMENTS COULD AWAIT THAT DATE. I STRESSED THIS WAS
                            IMPOSSIBLE AND IF LARG WAITS UNTIL JUNE 30 TO MAKE NEW SUPPORT
                            ARRANGEMENTS, <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> WILL RE GROUNDED.
                            QADHAAFI SAID HE RECOGNIZED NEED FOR CONTINUED AMERICAN HELP AND WOULD
                            CONSULT WITH <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> AUTHORITIES. I
                            INFORMED HIM THAT NORAIR REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOW IN LIBYA AND COULD BE
                            CONTACTED, QADHAAFI MADE WRITTEN NOTE OF THIS AND INDICATED THEIR
                            PRESENCE HERE AT THIS TIME IS VERY HELPFUL.</p>
                        <p>11. I THEN TURNED TO QUESTION OF CONUS TRAINING EMPHASIZING NEED, AS IN
                            CASES AMMO AND SPARE PARTS, FOR FORWARD PLANNING. TRAINING SPACES MUST
                            BE RESERVED MANY MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND IN PAST IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY
                            DISAPPOINT <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> WHEN IT REQUESTED
                            TRAINING ON VERY SHORT NOTICE. AT PRESENT TIME WE UNAWARE WHETHER <gloss

                            PERSONNEL REPRESENTS AN OFFICIAL REQUEST. QADHAAFI OBVIOUSLY UNINFORMED
                            BUT INDICATED THAT <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> RECOGNIZES NEED
                            FOR SUCH TRAINING AND THAT HE WOULD LOOK INTO MATTER WITH <gloss

                        <p>12. REVERTING TO ARSEC I AGAIN SOUGHT QADHAAFI'S VIEWS RE ITS FUTURE. HE
                            REPLIED THAT SINCE MOST OF ARMY'S WEAPONS ARE BRITISH, ARSEC HAS NO REAL
                            FUNCTION. I REPLIED THAT ARSEC HAS BEEN WORKING MOSTLY IN FIELDS OF
                            COMMUNICATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. QADHAAFI SEEMED SURPRISED AND INDICATED
                            HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT COMMUNICATIONS WORK WAS UNDER PRIVATE CONTRACT. I
                            CONFIRMED THAT WHEREAS THIS WAS ALSO TRUE, ARSEC HAD BEEN QUITE
                            SEPARATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY INVOLVED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE
                            COMMUNICATIONS FIELD. QADHAAFI SAID HE WOULD LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AND
                            LET ME KNOW <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'S FURTHER VIEWS.</p>
                        <p>13. IT OBVIOUS AT THIS POINT QADHAAFI FEELING VERY MUCH PRESSED BY HIS
                            SCHEDULE. I NEVERTHELESS PUSHED AHEAD WITH MATTER OF MATRATIIN WHICH IS
                            SUBJECT OF SEPARATE TELEGRAM.</p>

                                >LARAF</gloss> WAS NEVER EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED BY EITHER QADHAAFI OR
                            MYSELF. HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT WANT TO GET INTO THIS QUESTION AND I
                            AVOIDED IT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE OPENED UP WHOLE AREA OF COMPLICATIONS
                            AND POSSIBLE CONTROVERSY WHICH WOULD HAVE NEGATED ANY PROSPECTS OF

                        <p>15. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT QADHAAFI HAD MADE UP HIS MIND AGAINST
                            CONTINUATION F-5 DEAL AND THAT HIS ACCUSATIONS ABOUT <gloss

                            IT IS IN OUR OVERALL INTEREST HERE THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE THIS SORT OF
                            PRETEXT. IF LIBYANS WISH CANCEL ARRANGEMENTS, I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT

                        </list>
                        <p>During our years at Wheelus Air Base, the U.S. Air Force helped the
                            Libyans get their own air force started. The rationale in 1965-1966 was
                            that this cooperation might provide the basis for continued U.S. use of
                            Wheelus. After 1967, the U.S. delivered ten F-5 aircraft (simple jets
                            designed for our military assistance program in less developed
                            countries), trained pilots for them and provided some basic
                            maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Now that our activities at Wheelus will be terminating in June, the U.S.
                            Air Force will no longer provide that basic support at Wheelus. The
                            question now arises: What kind of relationship should we substitute, if
                            any?</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and the Defense and State Departments recommend that the
                            Libyans be told:</p>
                        <p>A US company (Norair) is prepared to contract with the Libyan government
                            to provide full maintenance services for Libya's remaining seven F-5
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Northrup will continue to provide spares.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is willing to go on selling
                            reasonable amounts of ammunition for these planes.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is prepared to train a few (7 or
                            less) more Libyan pilots in the U.S. at Libyan expense.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. will maintain a liaison unit of five <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                >USAF</gloss> people in the embassy to facilitate the above.</p>
                        <p>The commercial sale of 2 C-130s is proceeding.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d52-02" facs="d52-02"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The argument for this relationship is:</p>
                        <p>This approach would eliminate our direct support for the Libyan Air Force
                            and reduce it to commercial transactions plus limited training.</p>
                        <p>It would maintain a minimal US relationship against the possibility that
                            things may change in Libya. The French aircraft will not become
                            operational in Libya even in small numbers for more than a year.</p>
                        <p>It would preserve a sense of some continued cooperation with the Libyan
                            government as a backdrop for preserving as quiet an atmosphere as
                            possible for our oil companies.</p>
                        <p>The argument against this relationship lies more in the future than in
                            the present. This step is mainly shifting maintenance to a private
                            contract. However, on the basis of pre-1969 arrangements eight more
                            F-5's are scheduled for delivery at the end of this year. Following all
                            the attention to the French-Libyan deal, going through with this
                            delivery may well be politically impossible for us.</p>
                        <p>The question, therefore, is whether we should decide right now that we
                            will not be politically able to maintain a serious on-going relationship
                            with the Libyan air force and make a clean break.</p>
                        <p>On balance, there is something to be said for moving gradually and
                            waiting out the situation a while longer.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That State be authorized to take the cutback position it
                            proposes now in the context of phasing out Wheelus but be cautioned to
                            do nothing that would commit us to shipping the remaining F-5's at
                            year's end.</p>

                        <p>1. Developments in Libya should be viewed within the context of general
                            trends in the Middle East. Foremost among these has been the growing
                            involvement of all Arab states in the Palestine issue. This has meant,
                            for the most part, joining the conflict against Israel or at least
                            supporting it. US prestige and influence in the Arab world has been
                            inversely related to this trend; from a high point of good will reached
                            as a result of President EISENHOWER's actions in the 1956 Suez war, the
                            course has been generally downward. The June 1967 war accelerated this
                            trend, and a sharp drop followed the US decision in early 1969 to supply
                            F-4 Phantom jets to Israel. Even the seven Arab states that could then
                            have been characterized as political moderates or conservatives and had
                            retained <pb n="3" xml:id="d53-03" facs="d53-03"/>diplomatic relations
                            with the US found it politically necessary to denounce the US publicly.
                            The actual delivery of the aircraft and their subsequent highly
                            publicized use in combat have led the Arab press to portray the US as a
                            supporter and ally of Israel and the primary enemy of the Arabs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Junta</p>
                        <p>2. The members of the Revolutionary Command Council that installed itself
                            in Libya in September 1969 were bound together by a common desire to
                            overthrow King <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>, who was for
                            them a symbol of corruption, the presence of foreign bases, and a too
                            strong pro-West stance. They are young, inexperienced officers between
                            the ages of 25 and 30, and have only vague ties to the various pan-Arab
                            ideological movements. Although they proclaimed appropriate slogans in
                            the early hours of their coup, they have not as yet developed a clear
                            and agreed upon political program. Libya's new rulers are seized both by
                            an enthusiasm for Arab nationalism and by a desire to modernize their
                            country. They have neither the expertise nor the machinery to make and
                            carry out decisions in an orderly manner, thus they are likely to be
                            caught up in cycles of failure and frustration.</p>
                        <p>3. The power relationship within the junta remains largely unknown.
                            Although Muammir Qaddafi has been named council president, prime
                            minister, and commander in chief of the armed forces, he does not appear
                            to be all powerful. The available evidence suggests that the 12-man
                            council, all of whose members have finally been publicly identified,
                            acts as a collegial group. There may also be other officers in the armed
                            forces who have a special relationship with and access to the council.
                            Recent evidence also suggests that the council has pro- and
                            anti-Egyptian factions with the former presently in the ascendancy.</p>
                        <p>4. The junta members, who were suspicious of the ease with which they
                            were able to oust the King, still are insecure. To date, however, the
                            junta has been challenged only by its own members. In December 1969, the
                            ministers of defense and interior were arrested before they could make a
                            planned move against <pb n="4" xml:id="d53-04" facs="d53-04"/>their
                            colleagues. There have been reports of discontent among the tribes of
                            Cyrenaica and elsewhere in the civilian sector. These groups do not
                            possess sufficient arms to challenge the army seriously, accordingly in
                            the present situation they do not appear to pose any real danger to the
                            regime. Under present circumstances, any move against the regime is
                            likely to come from within the army. The junta has begun transferring
                            units of the armed forces that seem most likely to become
                            troublesome—the Cyrenaicans—to Egypt for training and eventual duty
                            along the Suez Canal. Thus far, approximately 2,600 men have been sent
                            to Egypt, with another 1,900 scheduled to join them before the end of
                            February.</p>
                        <p>5. Perhaps of far more significance than this is the movement of Egyptian
                            troops into Libya, an operation that began in December. Some 1,500 to
                            2,000 Egyptian soldiers are now stationed in Benghazi and Tripoli.
                            Approximately 500 other Egyptians have been assigned to military,
                            security, and communications posts. Thus, the Egyptians may be in enough
                            key points to forestall any countercoup by indigenous elements. In the
                            event of foreign moves to topple the regime, these Egyptian units could
                            probably be considered as controlling an air- or beach-head through
                            which additional forces could be moved into Libya.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Policy Trend</p>
                        <p>6. For Libya's new rulers, there is no obvious conflict between Libyan
                            and Arab nationalism. One of the first statements issued by the junta
                            was an attack on King Idris for his relatively passive attitude toward
                            the Palestinian guerrilla movement and the Arab-Israeli conflict. In
                            fact, however, there had been some support of the Arab cause by Idris.
                            The Palestine Liberation Organization was allowed to carry out a number
                            of activities in Libya, and sizable official contributions had been made
                            to it. By the end of 1969 Libya had also contributed more than $200
                            million to Egypt and Jordan, but for the junta this was not enough.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d53-05" facs="d53-05"/>
                        <p>7. At the recent Arab summit conference in Rabat, Qaddafi was most vocal
                            in his demands that wealthy Arab states increase their commitment to the
                            struggle against Israel. As proof of its own commitment the Libya
                            leadership now has decided to grant Egypt $96 million in addition to its
                            annual subsidy of $59 million. Another symbol of Libya's commitment to
                            the Arab war effort is its transfer of troops to Egypt, even though this
                            also serves as a convenient way to remove possible dissidents.</p>
                        <p>8. Upon seizing power, the council announced that it would honor existing
                            oil concessions, which brought in revenues last year that may have
                            amounted to $1.2 billion, and the oil companies report that operations
                            in Libya have continued without significant harassment. In January the
                            Libyan Government began negotiations with a number of operating oil
                            companies, including some US corporations. These talks aim at securing
                            higher posted prices on which government revenues are based. The
                            companies are being threatened with unspecified punitive actions if they
                            fail to reach an agreement. Nationalization, always the ultimate
                            possibility, has not been raised by the new Libyan rulers and at this
                            point does not appear to enter the picture. Indeed, Libyan commitments
                            to purchase a sizable number of French aircraft and promises of more aid
                            to Egypt and Jordan would suggest that Libya cannot afford to engage in
                            adventurism in its oil arrangements.</p>
                        <p>9. So far, given the quick US decision to meet Libyan demands for the
                            evacuation of Wheelus Air Base, official relations have not been overly
                            difficult. Certain irritations have arisen, however, and the Libyans
                            have so far failed to delineate the nature and the form of the military
                            assistance relationship they profess to desire. This may have to await
                            complete evacuation of the base, because the Libyans continue to be
                            highly suspicious of US and British intentions.</p>
                        <p>10. To date, the junta has kept the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            at arms length. The Soviets offered military assistance in the first few
                            days of the coup, but were quickly rejected. As far as we know,
                            subsequent approaches <pb n="6" xml:id="d53-06" facs="d53-06"/>have also
                            been rebuffed. This negative attitude of the Libyans may be reinforced
                            by the advice reportedly offered by Nasir not to become dependent upon
                            the Soviets for support. France, seeing a big power vacuum in Libya and
                            aware of the economic advantages available, is seeking to fill that void
                            partly. Paris' future intentions are unclear, other than its obvious
                            desire to increase its influence all along the North African littoral.
                            The Maghreb states, which are themselves moving toward a closer
                            relationship with France, probably hope that the growing role of France
                            in Libya is a force that will help preserve Libya's Maghreb
                            orientation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Junta and its Future</p>
                        <p>11. The life expectancy of the junta will ultimately depend upon several
                            factors. First and foremost, the junta must guard against serious
                            dissidence within its own ranks. In December 1969, Qaddafi had to act
                            quickly to a potential threat from within the junta. Coup attempts are
                            also possible by either members of the former ruling clique or other
                            disaffected civilian groups; however because they lack cohesion and an
                            effective power base, their chances of dislodging the junta are minimal.
                            Moreover, Nasir is apparently willing to give support in preventing any
                            effort of this type. Over the longer run, the rulers of Libya need to
                            find ways to encourage popular support. To be sure, much mileage will be
                            gained from publicizing the removal of Western military forces from the
                            country and the use of the US as a whipping boy for Arab military
                            shortcomings. Public attention, however, cannot be diverted from
                            domestic problems forever. Such civilian support as there is for the
                            regime comes from professional men, university graduates, lower grade
                            military officers, lower level government officials, and
                            students—precisely the same elements that were the most disaffected
                            under the monarchy. Having proclaimed its intention to modernize Libya
                            and rid it of the evil vestiges of the old regime, the junta will have
                            to show some signs of making good its promise.</p>
                        <p>12. Another factor is the relationship between the junta and Egypt. At
                            some point, it could well <pb n="7" xml:id="d53-07" facs="d53-07"
                            />become a liability to both parties. At present it would be difficult
                            for opponents of the regime to attack its close cooperation with Egypt
                            without being accused of hampering the struggle against the Israelis. As
                            the relationship is maintained—and perhaps expanded—the presence of
                            large numbers of Egyptian advisers and troops in Libya could become a
                            source of irritation. A growing realization that financial resources
                            that could be used for internal development are being sent outside Libya
                            could add to public discontent. For the Egyptians, the tangible benefits
                            accruing from their present relationship are important. If the junta
                            maintains power and acquires a substantial arms inventory, Libyan
                            military equipment might eventually represent a contingency asset for
                            Cairo. During the next few years, however, Egyptian ability to
                            assimilate more sophisticated weapons will remain limited, and Libyan
                            arms will be of far less significance to Nasir than Libyan financial
                            support.</p>
                        <p>13. With the passage of time, increased self-confidence and experience
                            may make the Libyan junta more independent minded. Moreover, recalling
                            his previous difficulties in Syria and Yemen, Nasir himself may come to
                            have second thoughts about extensive involvement with the Libyan regime.
                            Whatever the course of Libyan-Egyptian relations and internal Libyan
                            politics, the junta's policy is likely to remain militantly anti-Israel.
                            This is probably the one important issue on which few Libyans would
                            disagree. Although Libya's business relations with the US will probably
                            be correct, Tripoli will be largely hostile, or at least cool, toward
                            the US which it will view as the chief mainstay of Israel.</p>

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">text not declassfied</hi>] unanimously favored [<hi
                                rend="italic">text not declassfied</hi>] option labeled 1-A which
                            is: Intensify efforts to influence the Libyan government to adopt
                            policies consistent with U.S. objectives. Oppose Libyan leaders and
                            policies inimical to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. objectives to be furthered by these efforts would be as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. To maintain normal diplomatic and commercial relations with Libya.
                            (Including U.S. oil interests.)</p>
                        <p>2. To influence Libya to maintain its independence, to develop its own
                            resources primarily as a member of the Mediterranean region with strong
                            ties to Western Europe and a balanced rapport with both the Maghreb and
                            Libya's eastern Arab neighbors, including Egypt.</p>
                        <p>3. To deny the development of an intolerable level of Soviet or other
                            communist presence and influence in Libya—including that exerted
                            indirectly through radical Arab states.</p>
                        <p>4. To use the U.S. position in Libya to support the development of
                            regional stability in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The United States has contracted to deliver 8 F-5 aircraft; the
                            commitment predates the September revolution. The matter of the U.S.
                            Government honoring its agreement with Libya has assumed a political
                            significance that obviously transcends the military value of the
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>2. I hosted a lunch on 15 April for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">David Newsom</persName> and Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DRP1">Rodger P. Davies</persName>; the
                            latter represented Joe Sisco. David Blee and Archie Roosevelt completed
                            the Agency side of this meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. The purpose of the meeting was to expose State more fully to the
                            thinking underlying the “Option 1-A” approved by [text not declassfied]
                            the President. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            consistently took the position that the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> was not really interested in Libya and that in official
                            matters the White House did not appear to reflect any of the attitude
                            inherent in both the [text not declassfied] discussion, as he understood
                            it, and the decision [text not declassfied] He cited the White House
                            view on the problem of the 8 F-5 aircraft as evidence of this. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DRP1">Davies</persName> appreciate that the decision on
                            the F-5s was directly related to the French <pb n="2" xml:id="d56-02"
                                facs="d56-02"/>Mirage deal with Libya, the agony over Phantoms for
                            Israel, public attitudes on the Arab-Israel war and the Israeli
                            pressures on the problem of Libyan arms. Nevertheless, both thought it
                            might help save Libya if the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could
                            get around the problem of reneging on its F-5 agreement.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> has come in
                            with a proposal that is designed to gain time and avoid the risk of a
                            crisis over a Libyan charge that the U.S. is not meeting an obligation.
                            The cable is attached and is a concise statement of the problem.</p>
                        <p>5. I have had extensive indicators from the oil companies in the past ten
                            days that they are now convinced that they should compromise and offer
                            the Libyans a price adjustment. What they will offer is late and little
                            but may just get them by their own crisis with the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>6. I think we are making some headway on our Option 1-A operation; it
                            will take several months to measure progress more concretely. In the
                            meantime, no bad news on Libya is good news [text not declassfied]</p>
                        <p>7. If there is any opening which will permit the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> to slip around the F-5 question it would clearly be
                            most helpful to the purposes of [text not declassfied] U.S. policy
                            objectives in Libya to do so. Since the White House has shown interest
                            in the fate of Libya, would it not be appropriate for you to use an
                            occasion to go over this one lightly with at least Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>? If the opportunity occurs
                            and you share our view on this problem, I recommend that you register
                            interest and concern on this with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. At a minimum our colleagues in State would be
                            appreciative of your intervention. However, all of us expect that if the
                            F-5s are sold as agreed, there would be almost insurmountable pressures
                            to sell Phantoms to Israel. If the government is not prepared to resist
                            these pressures, it would be better not to go through with the F-5
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>1. Following instructions should be held for presentation upon Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>'s return. After
                            careful consideration Libyan and general area factors, we have decided
                            that we should take following positions re <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> requests for <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss>
                            support:</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador would start out with general statement his impressions of
                            his Washington visit with principal emphasis on desire <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for friendly relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. He would state that he had found in
                            Washington a considerable concern <pb n="2" xml:id="d57-02"
                                facs="d57-02"/>over the course of Libyan-US relations. Our
                            government had in mind the professions of desire for a new relationship
                            after we agreed to leave Wheelus. Instead we have experienced moves
                            against both the official and private American community. We have not
                            seen the development of the new relationship as we had hoped.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador goes on to say he had been asked to reiterate to <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> at highest levels that the United
                            States fully accepts the change in government in Libya and has no desire
                            or intention to interfere in its internal affairs. We would hope this
                            could be reciprocated by a lessening of the apparent suspicion directed
                            toward us by some in the Libyan Government.</p>
                        <p>4. We recognize the differences which exist between us in the view of the
                            Arab-Israel issue. Even here, we feel that the Government of Libya has
                            not taken sufficient note of the moves made by the United States toward
                            a balanced policy in the area.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d57-03" facs="d57-03"/>
                        <p>5. Ambassador would then lead into subject of the additional eight F-5s
                            confirming that question of their delivery has been under review.</p>
                        <p>6. We wish to confirm that, after some slippage because of a Northrop
                            strike, production of the aircraft is proceeding normally amid present
                            indications are that the planes will be ready for delivery in January
                            and February 1971. We also wish confirm that no action has been taken or
                            is contemplated to divert these planes to other possible purchasers.</p>
                        <p>7. As <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> is aware, the terms of the
                            letter of offer permit the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to cancel
                            all or part of the order at any time prior to delivery “under unusual
                            and compelling circumstances when the best interests of the US require
                            it” (Clause A-6). An option to cancel is, of course, also open to the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> (Clause B-4). These were
                            standard provisions in all such sales contracts and are intended to
                            enable either party to review the situation at any time prior to
                            delivery in the light of circumstances at the time.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d57-04" facs="d57-04"/>
                        <p>8. We do not believe current situation provides basis for a definite
                            decision now to proceed with deliveries which will not in any event take
                            place for another nine or ten months; neither do we wish to take any
                            prejudicial action at this time. Consequently, we have taken a
                            deliberate decision not to invoke Clause A-6 of the letter of offer at
                            this time but to make our decision on the basis of the general area
                            situation and the developing relationships between the two countries
                            much closer to the time of actual delivery.</p>
                        <p>9. We hope that our reasons for thus deferring a decision will be
                            understandable to the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>. Meanwhile,
                            we are prepared to carry out the following actions in accordance

                        </list>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Oil is Libya's Major Diplomatic Weapon. Concern over the ultimate
                            intentions of the present Libyan Government toward the mainly American
                            and British-owned oil industry in Libya appears well justified: the
                            ruling junta is clearly no friend of the international “majors” and is
                            almost certainly considering a number of a1ternative solutions to
                            Libya's 3 present heavy dependence on those companies (as evidenced by
                            Libya's recent contacts with the Soviets and other Eastern Europeans,
                            the French, and the A1gerians). However, in connection with the current
                            negotiations over the “posted” or tax-reference price of crude oil, it
                            seems unlikely that the Libyans would move against foreign equity
                            interests in the industry as a whole—by total or partial
                            nationalization, by sequestration, or by general revocation of
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>Libyan Prime Minister Mu'amar QADHAAFI probably views western (US, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and to a lesser extent <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) equity interests in Libyan oil as the
                            most important remaining hostage to the anti-Israel cause, and he
                            probably would not squander his highest trump card, unless and until he
                            were to reach the conclusions (a) that cooperation of any sort with the
                            pro-Israel Western states is counterproductive to the cause and (b) that
                            he could nationalize <pb n="2" xml:id="d58-02" facs="d58-02"/>the oil
                            interests of these states without military or subversive moves against
                            his regime.</p>
                        <p>There is little evidence that he has reached either conclusion. On the
                            first point, Libya is continuing to seek some limited military
                            cooperation with the US as well as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Furthermore, QADHAAFI has just
                            launched an inter-Arab diplomatic initiative for his own, as yet
                            undisclosed, plan for the settlement of the Arab-Israeli confrontation.
                            Given the great influence on QADHAAFI of UAR President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">NASSER</persName>, this “QADHAAFI plan” (although
                            almost certainly calling for strong Arab pressures against the US)
                            probably also reflects <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            waning hopes for a political settlement based on US influence over
                            Israel. Unless and until <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            called on Libya to take all-out action against US interests, QADHAAFI is
                            not likely to act rashly against the US oil interests in Libya. On the
                            latter point, QADHAAFI would in any case move extremely cautiously until
                            after the complete evacuation of American forces from Wheelus Air Base,
                            now scheduled for mid-June. On balance, and assuming that the Arab cause
                            does not deteriorate dramatically during this period, QADHAAFI probably
                            will not nationalize the industry as a whole over the next few
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>Some Companies Are More Vulnerable Than Others. On the other hand, the
                            Libyans will almost certainly continue to harass, threaten, and restrict
                            individual companies in different ways (such as the recent production
                            limitations imposed on Occidental). There is probably at least an even
                            chance that the Libyans will move soon against the equity interests of
                            one or more American oil companies (most likely, by the revocation of
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d58-03" facs="d58-03"/>individual concession
                            agreements), partly to settle old scores and partly to pressure the rest
                            of the industry into moving toward an acceptable solution to the posted
                            price issue. Many Libyans—particularly chief oil negotiator and former
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MMS1">Mahmud
                            MAGHRABI</persName>—are convinced that a number of companies (notably
                            Occidental) engaged in flagrant corruption not only in obtaining their
                            original concessions, but also in their other operational problems with
                            the royalist government. Some of the companies were associated very
                            closely in one way or another with now discredited officials of the
                            former regime, some of whom have been actively plotting against the
                            present regime. There are many skeletons in the closet, and, depending
                            on which facts are known to and considered important by the Libyans, a
                            number of companies are undoubtedly vulnerable to individual action.
                            Furthermore, some companies may also be subject to Libyan action for
                            failure (by the present government's stricter standards) to comply with
                            their legal obligations under their concession agreements and related
                            regulations. Thus, action against any one company over these next few
                            weeks need not, and probably will not, indicate Libyan intentions to
                            move against the industry as a whole.</p>

                        <p>Dear Dave:</p>
                        <p>I am writing to request your review of the current State/Defense
                            instructions on termination of the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss>-Libyan Government Economic Assistance Agreement. Paragraph
                            C of the Agreement provides for the payment of “$1,000,000 per year for
                            each of the calendar years 1965 through 1971.” Nevertheless, the
                            State/Defense airgram instructs Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> to inform the Libyan Government that no more
                            payments will be made since the US has in fact overpaid due to
                            termination of our effective use of Wheelus AFB as of November 19,
                            1969.</p>
                        <p rend="right">The Honorable<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PD1">David Packard</persName>,<lb/> Deputy
                            Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The legal merits of this complicated issue have been the subject of
                            differences between our lawyers for some months. Our respective legal
                            offices differ essentially over whether we are legally obligated to pay
                            for our effective use of Wheelus in 1968 and pro rata in 1969, based on
                            Paragraph C of the Economic Assistance Agreement (the State position),
                            or whether the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has paid more than
                            legally required (the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> position
                            constructed from the negotiating history). While the Legal Adviser's
                            Office has accepted the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> position as
                            a plausible legal argument, it believes the more persuasive conclusion
                            is that the timing of the payments, as well as their totality, were in
                            consideration for Wheelus and that the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> is therefore obligated under Paragraph C of the
                            Agreement to pay $1,000,000 for 1968 and $906,840 for 1969 (the pro rata
                            amount through <pb n="2" xml:id="d59-02" facs="d59-02"/>November 19).
                            This amount could, of course, be offset by any valid claim which we
                            determined to exist and decided to press under international law arising
                            out of early termination of our effective use of Wheelus and other areas
                            at <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the view, based on recent consultations with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>, that
                            submission of the current <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position
                            would not be beneficial to overall <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            interests. We believe that it would be difficult to present, inasmuch as
                            it could not be supported by any written understanding with the Libyan
                            Government, and that it would almost certainly become the object of a
                            dispute. One possible <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> reaction
                            would be the demand that unpaid amounts under the Economic Assistance
                            Agreement be offset against the $7,000,000 due the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> under the 1967 F-5 contract. Another
                            reaction would be the contentious filing of claims in connection with
                            Wheelus withdrawal prior to the June 30, 1971 deadline provided in the
                            December 23, 1969 Agreed Minute.</p>
                        <p>The policy rationale underlying our decision to withdraw from Wheelus AFB
                            was based on our desire to remove an important stumbling block from
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> relations and to develop a fresh start. Having made
                            this basic decision, we believe it important to complete our final
                            withdrawal in a manner which promotes rather than detracts from this
                            objective. Such has been our conduct in other areas of the Wheelus
                            withdrawal. The Libyans have fulfilled their understanding thus far to
                            facilitate our withdrawal. Adherence to our present position would, in
                            our view, be inconsistent with our general policy. Despite uncertainties
                            in our relationship with Libya at this time, and in recognition of the
                            importance of other US interests in that country, we wish to avoid
                            positions on Wheelus, where possible, which we consider likely to
                            adversely affect our overall interests.</p>

                        <p>I would therefore appreciate your looking into this matter in the light
                            of the above points and would hope that you could concur in the attached
                            draft telegram which would authorize the Ambassador to acknowledge that
                            we owe $1,906,840 under the Economic Assistance Agreement but reserve
                            our right to present any valid claim we may wish to present under
                            international law and our intention of including this amount in the
                            discussion of other outstanding financial questions in the near future.
                            There is some urgency to this as we should send revised instructions to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> before the
                            completion of the withdrawal from Wheelus and the termination of the

                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> Europe-based tactical aircraft) have
                            now been transferred to bases in Europe, chiefly in Spain and
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has apparently renamed Wheelus
                            “Ukba ibn Nafia”, after the 7th century Arab conqueror of North Africa
                            (who also expelled the Christians from there). The <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has not revealed its intended use of
                            Wheelus other than to declare that it will be used “to defend Arabism
                            and humanity”. It has repeatedly denied that it would allow control of
                            former U.S. and U.K. bases to pass to “foreigners”.</p>

                        <p>The Libyan Air Force still maintains its headquarters at Wheelus and we
                            expect that French technicians may work there in connection with the new
                            Mirage deliveries expected later in 1970.</p>
                        <p>The Wheelus withdrawal has been accomplished over the last six months
                            with full Libyan cooperation. The event itself passed without incident
                            or significant adverse publicity in Libya or the Middle East. The <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> is, however, planning ten days of
                            celebrations later in the month and the possibility exists that
                            delegations from other Arab countries, notably the UAR and Sudan, will
                            be invited to participate. Negotiations between the Libyans and
                            ourselves are scheduled to begin June 13, on a series of complicated
                            issues connected with our withdrawal from Wheelus. These include
                            termination of the Wheelus Base Agreement, the Economic Assistance
                            Agreement (under which we paid for use of Wheelus) and possibly of the

                            1970</p>
                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName>
                            <lb/>Under Secretary for Political Affairs<lb/>Department of
                            State<lb/>Washington, D. C. 20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Alex:</p>
                        <p>I am replying to your letter of June 2nd about possible payments due to
                            the Libyan Government, under the 1954 Economic Assistance Agreement, as
                            a quid pro quo for the use of Wheelus through November 1969. Given the
                            differing views of Counsel, I believe it would be an error to give the
                            Libyans any statement to the effect that we owe them anything under the
                            Economic Assistance Agreement. I should add that our lawyers remain
                            convinced that we do not have a legal obligation to pay the amounts in
                            question, and I do not think that we should be reluctant to explain to
                            the Libyans that our records show that the payments agreed under the
                            Economic Assistance Agreement in 1954 represented an average annual quid
                            pro quo of $2 million.</p>
                        <p>As a practical matter, I would recommend against any further payments
                            regardless of how one comes out of the legal question in view of our
                            claim for damages resulting from our forced, pre-mature withdrawal from
                            Wheelus. That claim exceeds, and thus cancels out, the $1.9 million that
                            the Libyans might argue are due under the Economic Assistance
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> be instructed accordingly.</p>

                            >Palmer</persName>'s recommendations for the forthcoming negotiations
                            with the Libyan Government (Tab B), we request Circular 175 authority
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to
                            negotiate and terminate, with one exception, all <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>-Libyan Government agreements currently in force. Both
                            Governments would reserve their respective legal positions regarding any
                            claims which may have arisen under international law in connection with
                            these agreements prior to their termination.</p>
                        <p>We believe this course of action desirable for the following reasons: (a)
                            amicable termination of the agreements may provide us with some leverage
                            with the Libyan Government which we believe is anxious to terminate
                            existing agreements, particularly the Wheelus Base, Economic Assistance
                            and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Agreements; (b) wiping the
                            slate clean of agreements negotiated with the former Monarchy shows our
                            willingness to respond to repeated Libyan assertions that such an action
                            is a necessary pre-condition for a new Us-<gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> relationship; (c) such a gesture may provide support
                            for those in Libyan Government councils who may be arguing for a
                            continuing relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                            For this reason, an important ingredient in our negotiations is the
                            tentative “post-aid” technical assistance proposals which we authorize
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to put
                            forward. (We have obtained agreement from <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> and the US Geological Survey to make certain
                            proposals.)</p>

                        <p>Our agreements with Libya, which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> would be authorized to terminate, fall into four
                            categories:</p>
                        <p>(1) 1954 Defense Facilities Agreement (TIAS 3107) and supplementary
                            Memoranda of Understanding (TIAS 3607, 4054 and 4620). Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> already has
                            authority to sign this termination.</p>
                        <p>(2) Economic Assistance Agreement, as amended. (TIAS 3105, 4577.)
                            Although Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> has
                            authority to terminate this agreement, authority is needed to amend his
                            instructions regarding the settlement of financial obligations under
                            this Agreement. We have reached a compromise with Defense which we
                            believe can be satisfactorily put forward to the Libyans, at least
                            through the next negotiating round. Our strategy entails maneuvering the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> into balancing all the claims
                            which it might have against the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            including any claim for payment of our obligations under the Economic
                            Assistance Agreement, against a possible claim we will lay on the table
                            for costs (which we are still determining) resulting from the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'s denial of our effective use of
                            Wheelus AFB after November 19, 1969. The amount of this possible <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> claim is, of course, indefinite, for
                            purposes of seeking <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> agreement.</p>
                        <p>The cable of instructions at Tab A reflects language on the Economic
                            Assistance Agreement which we have worked out with <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> subsequent to your exchange of letters

                            terms of the Military Assistance Agreement of the provisions <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d62-03" facs="d62-03"/>relating to restrictions on use and

                            believe that we can run a minimal military assistance program without
                            either a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> agreement or <gloss

                        <p>(4) Agreements Relating to Economic and Technical Assistance Matters.
                            (TIAS 3382, 3290, 3602, 3810, 4974 and 3480.) Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> requires authority to
                            terminate these agreements. Libya became an “aid-graduate” country in
                            1965 and several of these agreements are no longer operative. Despite
                            the fact that some provisions of one of the agreements could be
                            theoretically beneficial to future activities of American technical
                            assistance personnel (limited privileges and immunities), on balance we
                            believe it desirable to terminate these agreements for the following
                            reasons: (a) since the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has
                            indicated its opposition to their continuation, we believe we would have
                            difficulty in securing <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> cooperation
                            in applying their provisions to any future US-<gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> technical assistance projects; (b) we believe the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> would be receptive at this
                            point only to a pragmatic, ad hoc approach to technical assistance; (c)
                            possible service agencies (USGS and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>)
                            indicate that the termination of these agreements would not affect their
                            current authority to operate in Libya, and that they would be able to
                            negotiate on an ad hoc basis for necessary <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> cooperation.</p>
                        <p>In sum, cancellation of these economic and technical assistance
                            agreements would have little or no adverse effect on US programs, and we
                            believe it could have important advantages in laying the psychological
                            basis for a new “post-Wheelus” phase in <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>-Libyan relations. Our gesture towards a “post-aid”
                            relationship is an important step in responding directly to a Libyan
                            national interest and thus could be helpful to our efforts to protect
                            our substantial interests in the Libyan oil industry.</p>

                        <p>Libya became independent in 1951 and formed its first army in 1953. In
                            September 1969, an army coup replaced the monarchy with a Revolutionary
                            Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>) headed by Colonel
                            Muammar Qaddafi. Before the coup, all weapons and military equipment
                            were of Western origin, primarily British and US, acquired through
                            purchase and grant aid worth in all about $75 million. Since the coup in
                            1969, Libya has drastically reduced its dependence upon the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US, has concluded a shaky
                            $400-million military-economic deal with France, and has received
                            clandestine deliveries of Soviet-made tanks from Egypt, as well as the
                            recent overt deliveries of tanks and other equipment via two Soviet
                            freighters. The 1970 Libyan defense budget is $245.5 million, about 21
                            percent of the total budget.</p>
                        <p>Note: This memorandum was produced solely by <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss>. It was prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence,
                            and coordinated with the offices of National Estimates, Strategic

                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d63-03" facs="d63-03"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The United Kingdom</p>
                        <p>1. Until 1970, the chief supplier of military equipment to Libya was the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. British dealings involved
                            equipment worth over $40 million, including tanks, armored cars,
                            artillery, small-arms, and naval ships. Some of this has not been
                            delivered; Libya has changed its mind about some items, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has reneged—at least for the moment—on an
                            order for 162 Chieftain tanks.</p>
                        <p>2. Britain was instrumental in setting up the Libyan Army and
                            paramilitary forces through a military mission that was part of a
                            20-year defense pact signed in 1953. The goodwill gained thereby among
                            the Libyan armed forces, however, did not survive the change of
                            government last year. Libya had previously regarded the agreement
                            primarily as a defense against Egypt. When the new government patterned
                            itself on Nasir's and brought in Egyptian troops and security men to
                            help sustain it, there was no longer any need for a Western defender.
                            This alienation from Western influence made the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> wary of delivering its best tanks into pro-Egyptian
                            hands. London's new Tory government will probably re-examine the order
                            and may conclude that since British tanks might pre-empt further Soviet
                            deliveries, British commercial interests should benefit from the sale.
                            At present, only a small British mission remains in Libya.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The United States</p>
                        <p>3. The US commenced its military aid to Libya in 1957 when it sent a
                            Military Assistance Advisory Group (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>) to administer the grant aid given to Libya under the
                            Military Assistance Program (<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>). From
                            1957 to 1970, this aid totaled about $33 million in small-arms, armored
                            vehicles, telecommunications, and aircraft. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> conducted Libyan Air Force training while the British
                            handled Libyan Army and Navy training. The US mission was based at
                            Wheelus Air Base, but when this installation was handed over to the
                            Libyans on 11 June 1970 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was
                            reduced to a liaison section of five men attached to the US Embassy <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="d63-04" facs="d63-04"/>. The Libyans now have nine
                            F-5s and three C-130s among their fleet of 30 aircraft. Eight more F-5s
                            are due to be delivered in early 1971, and five C-130s remain on order.
                            Five Libyan airmen are presently scheduled to receive flight training in
                            the US.</p>
                        <p>4. Despite the political differences between Libya and the US, primarily
                            over US policy toward Israel, the Libyans apparently wish to continue
                            receiving US military assistance, perhaps as a stopgap measure until
                            French Mirage deliveries can begin. On the other hand, delivery of more
                            US Phantoms to Israel would probably cause a strong Libyan reaction
                            against the US, including a complete breakdown of any further military
                            assistance programs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The French</p>
                        <p>5. The French have only recently entered the military assistance picture
                            in Libya, but they did so with high drama and great initial impact. In
                            January 1970, Paris announced the conclusion of a military-economic
                            assistance program that included the eventual sale of 110 Mirage
                            aircraft. The package was estimated at some $400 million. Despite
                            pressure from Israel and the US, as well as from domestic public
                            opinion, Paris seized the opportunity of making the sale to increase
                            French prestige and influence in the Arab world and reap the economic
                            advantages that this seemed to entail. In justifying their decision, the
                            French argued that a vacuum existed in Libya as a result of the US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> pullout, and that if they did not
                            sell the planes, the Soviets would.</p>
                        <p>6. The high hopes the French originally had for using the arms deal as a
                            wedge for rapidly expanding cultural and economic ties have dimmed,
                            primarily because of Libyan indecision. There have been reports that the
                            Mirage sale itself is in trouble, but there is no firm evidence that
                            either the French or the Libyans intend to break their contract. Details
                            regarding the training of Libyan pilots have <pb n="5" xml:id="d63-05"
                                facs="d63-05"/>not been worked out, but 18 Libyans have already
                            departed for training in France and—at last report—more were expected to
                            leave in the fall.</p>

                        <p>7. Egyptian military assistance has been delivered clandestinely, and it
                            is not yet clear whether the armaments that Cairo has shipped to Libya
                            were from Egyptian inventories or were cut-out deliveries from the
                            Soviet Union. In any event, the equipment has been delivered by Egyptian
                            ships, and it has been manned by Egyptian personnel. It consists of two
                            or three ex-Soviet minesweepers and an estimated 65 obsolescent T-34
                            tanks, which arrived in March and. May of this year complete with
                            Egyptian training missions. Although it has been suggested that the
                            armored training mission merely served as a cover for an Egyptian force
                            that would buttress the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> in case of
                            trouble, an adequate “palace guard” already existed in the form of two
                            Egyptian commando battalions and perhaps 1,500 Egyptian security men.
                            Egypt also transferred its own Naval Academy out of enemy range in
                            Alexandria to the Libyan town of Susa, where it would presumably serve
                            the Libyan Navy as well.</p>
                        <p>8. This program of military assistance has been supplemented by political
                            discussions concerning some form of tripartite union between Egypt,
                            Libya, and Sudan. To date any such “union” is without substance, and the
                            initial steps toward it have dealt largely with economic cooperation. In
                            short, it was believed that Nasir wished to establish a relationship
                            with Libya that would enable him to derive maximum benefits from Libya's
                            oil wealth while becoming as little involved as possible. He wanted to
                            maintain the pro-Egyptian <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, and he
                            probably hoped that he could benefit from a role as the Soviet Union's
                            arms broker in Libya much as he had done in Yemen.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Union</p>
                        <p>9. The Soviet Union entered the picture suddenly and with little warning
                            with an overt delivery of tanks and artillery on 18 July 1970. Since the
                            coup <pb n="6" xml:id="d63-06" facs="d63-06"/>in September 1969, the
                            Soviets had made offers to Libya, and a special envoy from the Soviet
                            Defense Ministry had visited Tripoli as early as 19 September. In
                            return, Deputy Prime Minister JALLUD and another member of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> journeyed to Moscow in November to line
                            up military supplies in case talks with the British collapsed. In March,
                            JALLUD was reported to have gone to Moscow again, rather than to his
                            announced destination of Cairo. The Libyans reportedly said they
                            preferred Soviet T-55 tanks (an improved model of the T-54) if
                            Chieftains could not be obtained from the British. [text not

                        <p>10. The known situation at present is that at least 57 T-54/55 tanks,
                            plus Soviet-made artillery and armored vehicles were unloaded from two
                            Soviet arms vessels [text not declassfied] To date, we have no hard
                            information on any arms agreement, its date, or its terms, nor have we
                            any good reporting on the presence or the extent of any Soviet military
                            mission in Libya. It is possible that the Egyptian armored unit
                            personnel are capable of training Libyans in T-54/55s as well as the
                            T-34s.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Outlook</p>
                        <p>11. There seems to be no doubt that the Soviet Union has been eager to
                            become a military supplier to Libya since the 1969 coup, but until now
                            the Libyans had appeared to hold Moscow politely at arms' length. Nasir
                            is reported to have advised Libya in March to deal with the French
                            rather than the Soviets in order to bind Paris more closely to the Arab
                            cause. More recently, Soviet pressure on Nasir appears to have led him
                            to counsel Libya to make some sort of deal with the Russians in order to
                            placate them, as well as to standarize its equipment with the other
                            important Arab states. One step Nasir is reported to have <pb n="7"
                                xml:id="d63-07" facs="d63-07"/>urged unsuccessfully was for Libya to
                            allow the Soviet Union to use al-Adem airfield after the British
                            evacuation.</p>
                        <p>12. Until the extent of the Soviet deliveries is known, three
                            speculations seem reasonable. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            has already announced that it intends to obtain arms from all quarters
                            “so that it will be indebted to no one.” Among its present suppliers,
                            the US, France, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> all have
                            various problems causing a delay in deliveries; Egypt is not itself a
                            manufacturer of arms and has to give serious consideration to its own
                            needs. This leaves the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ready,
                            willing, and able to deliver goods that Libya wants immediately, and it
                            is unrealistic to expect that the Libyans could have held off dealing
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> much longer. The
                            political aspects of the deal will probably become clear when the
                            arrangement for training personnel is revealed.</p>
                        <p>13. Secondly, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may have learned
                            a lesson in Yemen about using Egypt as its front, and it may have
                            decided that Soviet arms purchased by Libya would be delivered by the
                            Soviet Union in Soviet vessels for all the world to see. In addition to
                            gaining credit in Libya for the Soviet Union, direct delivery would also
                            give the Soviets greater leverage over the Libyan arms supply and
                            perhaps over Nasir as well by exerting some control over his bankers,
                            the Libyan <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>14. A third possibility, raised by US Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>, is that the Soviet deliveries
                            might be for broader Arab requirements rather than solely for Libyan
                            use. It is possible that Libya is intended to be an area for the
                            maintenance of strategic reserves of weapons and a training sanctuary
                            for all the Arab confrontation states.</p>
                        <p>15. In any event, this is probably the first direct delivery to Libya by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of any major items of military
                            equipment. The new deliveries may well be an indication that the Libyans
                            will turn to the Soviet Union, for reasons of reliability of supply if
                            nothing else, as the main source of equipment for their land forces in
                            the future.</p>

                        <p>The introduction of Soviet medium tanks and armored personnel carriers
                            into Libya directly from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on
                            July 20-22 has not in itself significantly altered the arms balance in
                            the region. However, we are concerned over its implications for the
                            future of US-Libyan relations, and are therefore asking Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> to return to
                            Washington for consultations.</p>
                        <p>The tanks involved are medium models, more sophisticated than those
                            previously in the Libyan inventory. Our intelligence indicates that they
                            came directly from the Soviet Union. Their delivery follows a British
                            refusal to supply the Chieftain tanks contracted for by the old regime
                            and inconclusive <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> negotiations for
                            French and West German models. Although we have no information on the
                            extent of any Libyan-Soviet agreements covering the deliveries, the way
                            is clearly opened for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            become a significant supplier of the Libyan armed forces and possibly to
                            establish a training mission in Libya. This would make sense in Libyan
                            terms, since the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council suspects both the
                            US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as being hostile to the regime,
                            unreliable suppliers, and pro-Israeli. The fact that we have not
                            indicated that we will deliver the eight F-5s to Libya for which they
                            have a valid contract strengthens this Libyan impression of us. The
                            British find themselves in the same position inasmuch as they have
                            suspended indefinitely any action on the delivery of 188 <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d64-02" facs="d64-02"/>Chieftain tanks for which the Libyans
                            also have a valid contract. (Both contracts, of course, were signed with
                            the old regime.)</p>
                        <p>The purchase of Soviet equipment is also consistent with the strong
                            pro-UAR attitude of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s leader,
                            Colonel QADHAAFI. In fact, purchase of the Soviet equipment may have
                            been stimulated by the Egyptians, who have been urging other Arab
                            nations to accept Soviet offers of military equipment. Moreover,
                            purchase of the Soviet equipment would be consistent with the Libyan
                            regime's policy of “unity” with Egypt and Sudan, whose armed forces are
                            Soviet-equipped.</p>
                        <p>We still have two significant interests in Libya we wish to preserve: our
                            important stake in the petroleum industry, and our diplomatic presence.
                            The consultations with the Ambassador would be designed to obtain his
                            considered estimate of the chances of their survival over the near and
                            mid-term.</p>

                                >Joseph Palmer</persName>, who is here until Friday on consultation.
                            [Memo at Tab A] The Secretary has also transmitted a memorandum for you
                            on recent Soviet arms deliveries to Libya. [Tab B] That issue along with
                            the problems currently facing our oil companies there and the Libyan
                            role in the Mid-East situation are the subjects which
                                <persName>Palmer</persName> is here to discuss.</p>
                        <p>As has been mentioned to you previously:</p>
                        <p>The Libyans may be aiming at establishing a government-owned petroleum
                            production complex. They have already approached several
                            production-related American companies with joint venture schemes giving
                            Libya 51% control.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have been shipping arms to Libya (continuing into this week).
                            Revolutionary Command Council head <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has stated that this represents Libya's interest
                            in avoiding dependence on any one supplier.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has informally assumed the
                            role of trying to harmonize Arab disunity. Following the meeting he
                            convened of Arab foreign and defense ministers last week, he issued a
                            statement which, in essence, supported everyone, including <persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> has been
                            thoroughly debriefed in Washington and my staff has talked at length
                            with him. I do not believe that a meeting with you is necessary. The
                            essence of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' memo
                            on the Soviet arms shipments was covered in last week's brief.</p>

                                >Palmer</persName>'s Visit</p>
                        <p>a. The session on Libya opened with a tour d'horizon on that country by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Joseph Palmer</persName>, who
                            was on a TDY trip to Washington. Among the factors he cited were the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>(1) The young regime (oldest 28 and youngest 24) seems to be solidly
                            established.<lb/>(2) The anti-foreign devil thrust has begun to
                            diminish.<lb/>(3) The motivation of any future nationalization of oil is
                            essentially a desire to control their own resources. Envisoned cutbacks
                            of oil production are really for conservation—to spin out the estimated
                            18-year life of the oil supply. The Libyans are insistent on obtaining
                            the same resource data as the oil companies would have for the United
                            States. The companies in question have not been especially
                            forthcoming.<lb/>(4) On the other hand:</p>
                        <p>(a) There is some lessening of suspicion of Americans.<lb/>(b) A
                            negotiated settlement on the posted price of oil remains a
                            possibility.<lb/>(c) One of the greatest opportunities of the U.S. is in
                            post-aid technical assistance; the Libyans want and appreciate our
                            technological prowess.<pb n="2" xml:id="d66-02" facs="d66-02"/>See
                            Special Minutes for Additional Items<lb/> (d) Most of the Libyan
                            students seeking education outside the Arab world will come to the
                            United States. (Here, the Chairman interposed a serious question: Since
                            1968, far-left, anti-American forces have concentrated on foreign
                            students—others in the USA tend to ignore them and there is a very good
                            chance that radical activists will emerge from this American exposure
                            who will work against all U.S. interests. The irony was cited of
                            students from lesser developed countries returning from Moscow somewhat
                            disillusioned with Marxism but returning from the USA well fired up to
                            challenge the existing order. The Chairman mentioned <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, who no longer wanted to risk
                            sending Congolese students to the States. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that this question
                            transcended [<hi rend="italic">text not declassfied</hi>] but attention
                            should be paid.)<lb/>(e) The Soviet arms deal (following bickerings with
                            British and French) was a straight cash arms deal without Soviet
                            technical personnel being involved thus far.</p>
                        <p>b. In regard to Option 1-A, the Ambassador made himself clear:</p>
                        <p>(1) [<hi rend="italic">text not declassfied</hi>]<lb/>(2) [<hi

                            LIBYA</p>
                        <p>In an up-dating of the December 1969 National Intelligence Estimate
                                (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>) 36.5-69, prepared on 6 May
                            1970, the Office of National Estimates concluded that the earlier
                            assessment which stated that “the main interests of the U.S. are not
                            endangered by the new government in Libya” remained valid but conceded
                            that “there are, however, many potential problem spots in U.S.-Libyan
                            relations.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>,
                            reporting in a message to the Department of State on 8 June 1970,
                            concluded: “On balance, we see no hard evidence at this time that the
                            Libyan Government (<gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>) intends a

                            newly completed plant. Steps have been taken toward closer coordination
                            of policies with the UAR and Sudan, and UAR military forces and training
                            facilities in Libya have reportedly been augmented. Partially as a
                            bargaining tactic with the U.S. oil companies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> flirted with the Soviet Union by
                            sending its Minister of Petroleum to Moscow and welcoming a Soviet
                            geological survey team in Libya shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>In none of these areas has there been a significant development that
                            dramatically alters the situation that existed in February 1970 when the
                            [text not declassfied] approved Option 1-A. Events in the Middle East
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="d66-06" facs="d66-06"/>during this period have,
                            however, produced a further erosion in the U.S. position. The policies
                            of the Libyan regime vis-à-vis the United States will be significantly
                            influenced by the course of the Middle East crisis surrounding the
                            Arab-Israel war and the Palestine problem. For example, a decision to
                            sell Phantoms to Israel, or a decision not to deliver those F-5's for
                            which the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has contracted, will
                            have an important impact on U.S.-Libya relations.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have given considerable thought within the Department to Option 1(a)
                            and come to the following conclusions.</p>
                        <p>General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. The regime is solidly in power.</p>
                        <p>2. Its intense suspicion of all foreigners and its massive surveillance
                            of foreign missions greatly restrict foreign maneuverability.</p>
                        <p>3. Any actions which heighten its suspicion of foreign interests can only
                            increase the danger to those interests.</p>
                        <p>4. The activism and impetuosity of the regime will be blunted only
                            through a doing and learning process. In the absence of these factors,
                            outsiders have little if any capability to guide, cajole, force or trap
                            the regime into different courses.</p>
                        <p>5. Although the regime has taken a number of steps against our interests,
                            it would be a mistake to interpret all such steps as anti-American. If
                            Swiss companies were producing 88% of Libya's oil, the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> would undoubtedly still be doing just
                            what it is now to obtain a greater return from and more control over the
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>6. We have had some influence over the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> through traditional diplomacy: (a) the phase-out of
                            Wheelus has lowered <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> suspicions;
                            (b) the rate of expulsions has greatly diminished; (c) anti-US
                            propaganda has lessened somewhat; (d) the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> has resisted temptations so far to accuse us of being
                            involved in plotting; (e) we undoubtedly have more frank and useful
                            dialogue with <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> than any other
                            Western power, with the exception of the French.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d67-03" facs="d67-03"/>
                        <p>7. The bulk of our economic interests in Libya are still intact.</p>
                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> wants continued access to
                            our science and technology. It has welcomed several initiatives we have
                            taken in this field and has made some itself. It has recently decided to
                            send almost all of its overseas students to the United States.</p>
                        <p>9. We are still in business with the only radical Arab State with which
                            we have diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, I have the following specific comments on Option
                            1(a):</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>State has sent over for your attention a file of cables (Tab A) which
                            raise the possibility of some form of armed intervention in Libya by a
                            combined group of Libyan exiles and mercenaries. The consensus of State
                            and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is that this activity, if it
                            takes place, is designed essentially to free certain figures prominent
                            under the old regime from prison. The plotters are billing it as a coup
                            attempt but from their description it is most likely a foray to release
                            political prisoners or a crude provocation.</p>
                        <p>The conspirators have sought our help but we have made it clear that we
                            have no desire to become involved in this operation. Their plot,
                            according to our embassy in Tripoli, seems doomed to political
                            self-defeat and even if successful would only result in the release of
                            detention of a group of undesirables anyway. More importantly if we were
                            suspected of involvement by the Government we could expect a “violent
                            reaction” and strong reaction against our interests in Libya. The
                            embassy concludes that “the operation only makes sense for the
                            instigator and possibly one of his jailed friends, certainly not for the
                            U.S. or West generally.”</p>
                        <p>All contacts with the plotters have been broken off and precautions are
                            being taken to insure that no U.S. military activity could inadvertently

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> has again been
                            pressed by the Commander of the Libyan Air Force for an immediate
                            decision on the F-5s for Libya. The Libyan Commander has indicated his
                            awareness that the aircraft are virtually ready for delivery. He stated
                            that he had waited “long enough” and that he now had to know where he
                            stood. He concluded by saying that if the decision was not communicated
                            to him shortly, he would have to bring the “<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> back into the act”. The Ambassador has urged that we
                            respond by January 8.</p>
                        <p>The policy issues at stake remain unchanged since this subject was
                            outlined in my memorandum of December 4, 1970 to the Acting Secretary
                            (attached). <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> continues to share

                        </list>
                        <p>The eight Northrop P-5 fighter aircraft which the United States agreed to
                            sell the previous Libyan regime in June 1969 will leave the production
                            line this December. They will be ready for delivery on schedule in
                            January and February. Officially, we have had “under review” since March
                            the question of whether it would be in our interest to deliver these
                            aircraft. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>
                            believes strongly that we must now decide this question since he may be
                            asked by the Libyans at any time regarding our intentions and he cannot
                            indefinitely indicate that no decision has been made. Defense has also
                            asked for a decision regarding the disposition of these planes in order
                            to complete its programming for the remainder of the fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>A decision on this subject could conceivably be delayed until perhaps
                            March by disposing of these eight planes through the military assistance
                            program to another recipient than Libya, and by earmarking another eight
                            for delivery to Libya before the summer of 1971. <gloss target="#t_AF1"
                                >AF</gloss> does not believe the chances of a change for the better
                            in our bilateral relations with Libya or in the Middle East situation
                            between now and March are significant enough to warrant a continued
                            postponement of a decision. Although as noted below <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> is in agreement in principle with going
                            ahead with delivery, it <pb n="3" xml:id="d69-03" facs="d69-03"/>points
                            out that a decision to proceed at this time would probably result in an
                            adverse reaction from Congress thus jeopardizing the pending <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 supplemental request for military
                            assistance funds. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> therefore makes its
                            concurrence in this memo contingent on the supplemental request.</p>
                        <p>Defense has also raised the possibility of delivering the eight F-5s to
                            Libya out of the production of Northrup's Spanish licensee. Such
                            deliveries would, however, still require United States approval, and
                            those who object to delivery in principle would no doubt feel that this
                            procedure was merely a subterfuge.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador believes that we should deliver the eight planes on
                            schedule to Libya under the contract of June 1969. <gloss
                                target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            agree with him. NEA does not.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for delivering the planes are several.</p>
                        <p>We have a valid contract with the Libyan Government, although it was
                            signed with the pre-revolution regime. The contract does contain a
                            “changed circumstances” clause which L believes could be invoked to
                            justify non-delivery (see attachment.) However, <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss> believes that doing so would set an undesirable
                            precedent and cast doubts on our role as a reliable military
                            supplier.</p>
                        <p>Militarily, the eight planes are inconsequential in the Middle East
                            situation. Their flying range is limited and logistical support of them
                            in a combat zone over the canal would be either difficult or impossible.
                            Libyan pilot and mechanic skills are limited severely in number and
                            quality. Even with these planes Libya would have only 18 fighters.</p>
                        <p>Politically, the delivery of the planes might reassure the Libyan regime
                            regarding our intentions toward it. Failure to fulfill the contract
                            would eliminate for a long time any basis for mutual confidence that may
                            exist. It could also provoke retaliation by the regime against our
                            diplomatic presence in Libya, and, at worst, cause a break in relations
                            with the last <pb n="4" xml:id="d69-04" facs="d69-04"/>“radical” Arab
                            regime with which we have such relations. Less likely, but still
                            possible, would be a retaliation against the American oil interest.
                            Non-fulfillment would certainly confirm to the regime its conviction
                            that our policy toward the Arab world is negative and toward Israel,
                            positive.</p>
                        <p>NEA does not disagree basically with the foregoing reasoning. However, it
                            believes that:</p>
                        <p>We would encounter substantial Congressional, press and public criticism
                            for “arming” a government which advocates a military solution to the
                            Palestine problem and has been increasingly unfriendly in its attitude
                            toward the United States. This criticism would be increased as a result
                            of the political federation of Libya with the UAR and Sudan which Syria
                            has now joined. H, in general, shares this estimate of the possible
                            Congressional reaction.</p>
                        <p>Israel, and its friends in the United States, would demand still more
                            military assistance to offset the addition to Libya's air force, thus
                            adding to pressures for escalation in military supply to the area.</p>
                        <p>Libya does not need the planes for its defense. Its defense needs will be
                            more than met by the purchase of a substantial number of French Mirages,
                            delivery of which should begin soon. Critics of the F-5 transaction
                            would make this point. (Originally, about 104 Mirages were ordered, but
                            this number may be reduced to 60, according to unconfirmed intelligence
                            reports.)</p>
                        <p>Libyan preoccupation with our Middle East policy means that there is
                            little we can do under present circumstances that is likely to change
                            their attitude toward us basically. Despite our withdrawal from Wheelus,
                            our attempts to maintain good relations have been basically
                            one-sided.</p>
                        <p>Deliveries of aircraft to Libya, in light of its closer relation with the
                            UAR, in effect are deliveries to Egypt. Even the French are beginning to
                            get concerned that further moves toward federation raise serious
                            questions regarding Libya's commitment that the Mirages would not fall
                            into third party hands and not be used in the Arab-Israel dispute. Libya
                            is in no position to give such an assurance to the United States and,
                            even if it did, it would be meaningless.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d69-05" facs="d69-05"/>
                        <p>NEA's view is shared at the staff level of the White House which regards
                            the possible disadvantages of fulfilling the contract as outweighing the
                            possible advantages of doing so.</p>
                        <p>Some consideration has been given to the possibility of delivery of the
                            planes to the Libyans on the condition that they transfer them and the
                            nine F-5s they now have to Tunisia through a bilateral arrangement with
                            that country after 17 Mirages had been delivered to Libya. NEA and H do
                            not believe this arrangement would off set the adverse public and
                            Congressional reaction that would be generated if we were to go through
                            with the deal now, or deflect increased Israeli demands on us. Defense
                            would have no objection in principle to the arrangement but notes that
                            it could not provide the funds that might be needed to make it work.

                        <p>Thus, the basic question is whether the U.S. interest would be best
                            served by (a) informing the Department of Defense that delivery of the
                            F-5s to Libya is to be made on schedule, or (b) informing the Department
                            of Defense that the contract is not to be fulfilled. Your approval of
                            one of these two options is requested below.</p>
                        <p>If the decision is to deliver the aircraft, Ambassador <persName

                            Libyan Government so that arrangements may be made by the Libyan Air
                            Force to receive them. If the decision is negative, the tactics and
                            timing of informing the Libyans would be left to Ambassador <persName

                        <p>1. It is my impression that we may be approaching a critical point in
                            Libya; I underline “may” because of the tenuous judgements involved on
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>a. that Qaddafi is gradually taking personal control of the government
                            and is supported by the entourage described in the attached
                            cable;<lb/>b. that Sadat and the Egyptians are probably very unhappy
                            with Qaddafi and may be considering an effort to unseat him:<lb/>c. that
                            JALLUD is the Egyptian candidate to replace Qaddafi;<lb/>d. that [text
                            not declassfied] is very hard-line on the Libyan regime and gives some
                            support and encouragement to those who would oust it;<lb/>e. that
                            Qaddafi is increasingly open and active in his opposition to communist
                            influence in the Arab world;<lb/>f. that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is unhappy with Qaddafi;<lb/>g. that the Libyans are
                            engaged in preparations to run the Libyan oil industry, at a reduced
                            level, with service contracts and direct marketing in Europe and
                            elsewhere;<lb/>h. that Qaddafi and his supporters are prepared to make
                            one last effort to preserve a basically U.S./Western European
                            orientation of Libyan society and its oil-based economy; and<lb/>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d70-02" facs="d70-02"/> i. that the oil companies are
                            prepared to stand their ground at all costs against Libyan demands that
                            are far out of line with the Gulf-OPEC agreement.</p>
                        <p>2. One of the most immediate problems facing us is: “Who is making the
                            decisions in Libya?” I have not seen any reporting from the Embassy that
                            suggests that JALLUD has been downgraded and that the relatively unknown
                            Sulieman Qaradha (formerly Qaddafils private secretary) and Al Huni are
                            the dominant influences on foreign policy — including the critical
                            decisions that lie ahead on Libya's role in the oil world. [text not
                            declassfied] Does <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss> have a clear view
                            of this situation?</p>
                        <p>3. It is possible that the four OPEC producers in the Mediterranean will
                            reach agreement on guidelines which will then be the basis for the
                            individual country negotiations with the individual companies; this is
                            apparently what the Libyans have in mind. The positions of the Libyans
                            and the oil companies appear to be too widely separated to be easily
                            bridged by the complicated process of negotiations now prospect. [text
                            not declassfied] If pressures develop in this process, it is clear that
                            the wings are fairly crowded with parties that are anxious to rush on
                            stage and play a role in exploiting the shaky situation which may
                            develop. The British, some of the Europeans (Germany and Italy for
                            example), the Egyptians, the Israelis, the Libyan exiles and, finally,
                            the Soviets have objectives and interests in Libya which, in the present
                            context, are not congruent with those of the U.S. Any of these might, in
                            a rapidly changing situation in Libya, be tempted to improve its
                            position at the expense of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. I have no recommendations to make at this time; the sole purpose of
                            this memorandum is to elicit thought, stimulate collection of
                            information and to seek your assistance in continuing the analysis of
                            this problem in the days and weeks immediately ahead.</p>

                            NATION, PRECLUDES THIS. HE ASKED WHAT IS REASON FOR THIS SPECIAL US
                            RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL: HE COULD SEE NO HISTORICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL,
                            RELIGIOUS OR OTHER RATIONAL BASIS FOR IT. THUS, HE MUST CONCLUDE, <gloss

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> TALKED ABOUT ROLE OF

                            AGAINST COMMUNISM BUT WITH RUSSIAN” HE SAID, “BECAUSE THE USSR HELPS THE

                            THESE INDICATE AMERICAN WRITERS MOTIVATED BY HATRED AND BLINDNESS

                                >QADHAFI</persName> SAID. THESE ARE (A) TRUE NON-ALIGNMENT,
                            INCLUDING OBTAINING ARMS FROM EAST AND WEST, REFUSING SOVIET PRESENCE
                            DESPITE ACQUISITION SOVIET ARMS, AND DENYING NAVAL VISITS REQUESTED BY

                        <p>7. I RESPONDED COVERING THE SAME POINTS <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >QADHAFI</persName> HAD ADDRESSED. OUR TALK I SAID WAS PROOF THAT
                            THE BASIC PROBLEM BETWEEN US IS THE ARAB-ISRAELI DISPUTE. I WELCOMED THE
                            CHANCE TO DISCUSS IT AND HOPED FOR MORE FRANK EXCHANGES WITH HIM AND
                            OTHER <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> OFFICIALS ON THIS SUBJECT.
                            EVERY NATION DECIDES ITS POLICY IN THE LIGHT OF ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS
                            AND US POLICY IS TO DO ALL IN ITS POWER TO SEEK JUST, HONORABLE, AND
                            PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN ME DISPUTE SINCE PEACE IN AREA IS IN OUR

                            PEOPLES.</p>
                        <p>8. US ADMIRES <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'S POLICY OF
                            NON-ALIGNMENT WHICH, NOTED, HAS BEEN REFLECTED BOTH IN WORDS AND DEEDS.
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d71-04" facs="d71-04"/>THERE, IS NO HATRED OR
                            RESENTMENT TOWARDS ARABS IN GENERAL, TOWARDS ANY OTHER ARAB REGIME, OR

                            OF CITIZENS OF ARAB ORIGIN; IT WANTS ONLY FRIENDSHIP OF ALL PEOPLES IN
                            THE AREA. REGARDING LIBYA, I SAID, THE <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WERE WEAKNESSES IN THE

                            I REMINDED <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> THAT OUR OFFERS
                            TO HELP ACHIEVE THESE DESIRES REMAIN OPEN. THOUGH HE DID NOT RESPOND
                            SPECIFICALLY TO MY SUGGESTION THAT US COULD HELP NOW IN CERTAIN
                            DEVELOPMENT FIELDS, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>,
                            UNLIKE JALLUD, DID NOT REJECT THE CONCEPT OUT OF HAND. ON CONTRARY, HE

                        <p>9. RETURNING TO QUESTION OF US ROLE IN THE ME DISPUTE, I POINTED OUT THAT
                            WHILE OUR POLICY HAS BEEN CONSISTENT, IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN APPROACH
                            HAVE EMERGED RECENTLY. I CITED PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >NIXON</persName>'S STATEMENT THAT US IS NEITHER PRO-ARAB NOR
                            PRO-ISRAEL, BUT RATHER IS PRO-PEACE, AND STRESSED THAT GOAL OF US POLICY
                            IS ACHIEVEMENT OF JUST, PERMANENT PEACE. I EMPHASIZED THAT PRESENT
                            ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING ACTIVELY IN QUEST FOR PEACE. GUAR HAS GIVEN
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> A CHANCE TO PROVE IT MEANS WHAT
                            IT SAYS. I SUGGESTED <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> SHOULD GIVE
                            US SAME CHANCE.</p>
                        <p>10. RESPONDING TO <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>'S
                            SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS, I DENIED CATEGORICALLY THAT <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

                            LIKELY MEAN TAKEOVER BY EXTREME RIGHTISTS. AFTER POPULATION'S EXPOSURE
                            TO “REPUBLICAN REGIME” PEOPLE WOULD REACT AND RIGHTISTS WOULD BE THROWN
                            OUT BY “MORE EXTREME LEFTIST” COUNTER COUP, AND SO FORTH, A PROCESS, HE
                            SAID, FROM WHICH NO ONE WOULD BENEFIT. I SAID THAT WE AGREED
                            WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND THAT HE COULD BE SURE WE WOULD NOT BECOME SO
                            INVOLVED.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> TURNED TO QUESTION ARMS
                            SUPPLIES TO PARTIES. HE ASKED IF <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            WOULD SELL PHANTOMS TO ANY ARAB COUNTRY. OBSERVING THAT HIS QUESTION
                            VERY HYPOTHETICAL, I SAID USG WOULD CONSIDER SUCH A REQUEST IN THE
                            CONTEXT OF THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE AREA. US IS CONCERNED, I SAID, TO
                            MAINTAIN THE BALANCE IN ORDER TO FOSTER A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> OBJECTED THAT US ARMS SUPPLIES
                            TO ISRAEL SINCE 1967 HAVE PERMITTED THE ISRAELIS TO RETAIN TERRITORIES
                            SEIZED THROUGH AGGRESSION. I REPLIED THAT US ARMS SHIPMENTS TO ISRAEL,
                            MADE RELUCTANTLY AND IN A LIMITED MANNER, WERE NECESSARY TO SAFEGUARD
                            THE BALANCE OF POWER WHICH THREATENED BY MASSIVE SOVIET ARMS SUPPLY,
                            AVOID FURTHER FIGHTING, AND PERMIT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A PEACEFUL
                            SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. BUT, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >QADHAFI</persName> ARGUED, THE ARABS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPEL THE
                            AGGRESSOR AND TO LIBERATE THEIR OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. I RESPONDED THAT
                            US SEEKS SAME GOAL OF RESTORING ARAB TERRITORY; WE SEEK THIS OBJECTIVE
                            IN CONTEXT OF PEACE.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> ASKED ABOUT PROCURING
                            SIDEWINDERS FOR F-5'S AND FIELD ARTILLERY FOR LARA. I TOLD HIM THAT
                            CONGRESS HAS PROHIBITED SALES OF SIDEWINDERS TO AFRICAN STATES BECAUSE
                            MISSILES ARE VERY COSTLY AND WE WISH TO AVOID SOPHISTICATED ARMS RACE IN
                            CONTINENT WHICH DESPARATELY NEEDS RESOURCES FOR ECONOMIC DEVELDPMENT.

                            WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW MANY 170 MM GUNS THE <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> REQUIRES, BUT WHEN I REMARKED ON THE DIFFERENCES

                                >USSR</gloss> TO SUCH QUESTIONS, HE SMILED AND ACKNOWLEDGED “THAT'S
                            A PROBLEM OF A DEMOCRACY.” I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE THOUGHT SOVIET
                            READINESS TO PROVIDE ARMS WAS PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCERN FOR
                            ARAB INTERESTS OR TO FURTHER THEIR OWN WIDER INTERESTS. HE SHRUGGED AND
                            SAID SOVIETS MIGHT BE MOTIVATED BY “FRIENDSHIP” OR “PERHAPS BY DESIRE TO

                        <p>One of the issues that has been hanging around for a long time may come
                            to a point of decision in the next month. I believe the decision is
                            self-evident, but I do want to acquaint you with the issue.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration
                            and prior to the Libyan coup, the US had entered into a contract selling
                            a small number of F-5 aircraft to Libya. Ten were delivered long ago and
                            eight remain to be delivered under the contract. Delivery of the final
                            eight has been withheld because of the political situation in Libya and
                            the present government's position toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                            Also, the rationale for our involving ourselves with the Libyan air
                            force—our retention of Wheelus airbase ended with our departure from
                            Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>I personally cannot conceive how we could defend sending any combat
                            aircraft to Libya under the present circumstances. Therefore, I see it
                            as a foregone conclusion that we will not go through with this
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>, however, will
                            be back here on consultation next month, attempting to persuade
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to go ahead with
                            the sale. His rationale is that we need to maintain some line to this
                            Libyan government.</p>
                        <p>My answer to that is that this Libyan government is not going to like us
                            no matter what we do.</p>
                        <p>I assume you agree.</p>

                        <p>HAK:<lb/>I sympathize with Hal's view but (1) the F-5's can't do any
                            significant harm in the Arab-Israeli contest, (2) if we don't sell them
                            the French or the Russians will and (3) there may be a way we could use
                            them to loosen up the aid talks (and here we have a real economic
                            interest).</p>
                        <p>Obviously there would be domestic criticism unless a good aid settlement

                        <p>Negotiations between the major oil companies and the oil ministers of the
                            Mediterranean oil countries have reached a difficult period.</p>
                        <p>Libya, which represents the Mediterranean countries, has demanded:</p>
                        <p>a substantial increase in the posted price of oil, on which taxes are
                            based;</p>
                        <p>that the companies reinvest a portion of their profits in the producing
                            countries;</p>
                        <p>and a bonus payment to the Mediterranean countries due to the savings
                            realized by the companies because of the lower transportation costs for
                            oil from Mediterranean, as opposed to Persian Gulf, terminals to
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>The oil companies are worried that Iraq and Algeria will support the
                            Libyan price demands by participating in an oil embargo, should the
                            companies reject Libya's proposals. They fear also that Libya and
                            Algeria are determined to force a price settlement in the Mediterranean
                            high enough above that recently reached between the companies and
                            Persian Gulf producers in Tehran to cause the Persian Gulf countries to
                            repudiate the Tehran agreement and ask for further increases in payments
                            from the oil companies. (The Shah has said he would not do this but if
                            the Mediterranean settlement is too high, domestic pressures may force
                            him to do so.) The companies are concerned that if the Mediterranean
                            companies do embargo oil the resulting oil shortage would be so
                            intolerable to governments of consuming countries that they would then
                            force the oil companies to accede to Libyan demands.</p>
                        <p>The companies are now considering their next moves. They have been told
                            informally that they must meet Libya's demands by midnight on March 18 —
                            (or else). However, Libya has so far avoided a major confrontation and
                            can continue to do so in the present situation if she so wishes.</p>

                        <p>NOTE<lb/>This Estimate assesses likely developments in Libyan policy,
                            particularly with regard to international relations. Since the Libyan
                            regime is a small and secretive group that appears to have formulated
                            few long-range plans, there are areas of considerable uncertainty, and
                            the judgments are necessarily tentative. Most are intended to apply only
                            to the next year or two, although a few longer term trends also are
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. The Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                            >RCC</gloss>), led by the 28 year-old Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, has gained great credit in Libya by forcing the
                            evacuation of Western military bases and by winning huge increases in
                            income from oil. It has done little to improve the lives of Libya's two
                            million people or to provide for broad participation in the running of
                            the country. It is not likely to move much farther in these areas in the
                            months ahead, but since the expectations of the Libyan people are not
                            very high, dissension will probably remain small in scale and
                            geographically fragmented. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> has sufficient assets—in public acceptance, troops, and
                            money—to maintain itself in office for the indefinite future.</p>
                        <p>B. Regarding oil, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>'s short-term
                            goals are to increase income and conserve Libya's assets. For the longer
                            run, it wants a greater Libyan role in oil operations. Outright
                            nationalization seems <pb n="3" xml:id="d74-03" facs="d74-03"/>unlikely,
                            at least in the next year or two, but steps to increase government
                            control of the oil industry in Libya will continue.</p>
                        <p>C. In a sharp break with the previous regime's policy, the <gloss

                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Czechoslovakia for arms.
                            Concurrently, it has continued to seek some of the weapons ordered from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName> regime, though it wants to change
                            some of the orders. The government clearly wants an elaborate military
                            establishment and prefers to avoid dependence on any single source of
                            supply. But Libyan personnel resources are so severely limited that no
                            amount of arms and money will give the Libyan Armed Forces the capacity
                            to pose a measurable military threat to any of its neighbors, much less
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>D. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> wants to be important in Arab
                            affairs. It has given a substantial portion of its income to other
                            countries, largely to encourage unity efforts and to promote the
                            anti-Israeli cause. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has
                            apparently been the prime advocate of the recently proclaimed federation
                            of Egypt, Syria, and Libya. We doubt that it will become a significant
                            supranational organization, but <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> wants to cooperate with Egypt, derives some
                            benefit from doing so, and by dint of the subsidy to Cairo, gains a
                            limited voice on general Arab policy toward Israel. In any case, Libya's
                            sheer financial ability to influence Arab—and even world—affairs will
                            grow rapidly.</p>
                        <p>E. Libyan relations with the Great Powers are colored by Libya's fervent
                            interest in the Arab-Israeli situation. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> gains some credit in Libya for its consistent support
                            for the Arabs. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has
                            shown no desire for close ties with Moscow. We believe that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> will continue to keep both the US and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at arm's length, while seeking
                            to diversify its ties to other Western Powers and to strengthen its
                            relations with the Eastern Arabs.</p>
                        <p>F. Certain Arab-Israeli events could greatly alter Libya's international
                            outlook. A major outbreak of hostilities could lead to expulsion of the
                            US official presence and to a Libyan move against one or more of the oil
                            companies. A settlement, on the other hand, could reduce Libyan
                            involvement in eastern Arab affairs; in time, if it held, the greatest
                            single impediment to US-Libyan relations would decline in
                            importance.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. THE FIRST 18 MONTHS</p>
                        <p>1. Two major and immensely popular changes have marked the first year and
                            a half in office of the Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>)—evacuation by the US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> of their bases and a whopping increase in
                            payments by foreign oil producers operating in Libya. Both came in the
                            area which the impatient young activists who make up the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> consider paramount—achieving Libyan
                            control over Libya's destiny. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            leaders know that the operations of the world oil industry are beyond
                            their reach, but they are also acutely aware that in today's market
                            Libya's role as nearby supplier of a fifth of Western Europe's oil gives
                            them an unprecedented amount of leverage over Western nations. They
                            remain ready to use that leverage to get increased revenue and, they
                            hope, to affect the course of the Arab-Israeli confrontation.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> appears to have consolidated
                            its control, holding over half the ministerial posts and staffing the
                            government with young men apparently loyal to itself. There are periodic
                            reports of disgruntlement, plotting, and complaints, but—on the basis of
                            the scanty evidence available—serious dissension appears to be small in
                            scale and geographically fragmented. Old regime exiles may entertain
                            hopes of a return to power and may mount periodic coup attempts, but we
                            doubt that they have adequate support within the country to make them a
                            serious threat to the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>. The
                            Cyrenaican Defense Force and the Tripolitanean Police, which might have
                            served as focal points for discontent, have been disbanded; about half
                            their members have been absorbed into the regular armed forces and the
                            remainder have been retired or dismissed. The Cyrenaican tribes have
                            been further subjected to government control by the transfer of title to
                            all tribal lands to the state, which <pb n="5" xml:id="d74-05"
                                facs="d74-05"/>can henceforth permit or deny tribal use of the land
                            and water. Two Egyptian commando battalions, of about 350 men each, are
                            stationed respectively in Benghazi and Tripoli as security insurance for
                            the regime.</p>
                        <p>3. Three <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members stand out. Muammar
                            Qadhafi, the 28 year-old Prime Minister, Defense Minister, and Chairman
                            of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, is clearly the most
                            influential man in the regime. His colleagues are consulted, they
                            sometimes argue heatedly with him, but in the end his view has usually
                            prevailed. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has on occasion
                            appeared impetuous and emotional, and something of a zealot. Certain
                            facets of policy—notably emphasis on public observance of religious
                            forms and on close ties with Egypt—reflect in part the weight of his
                            personal convictions. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has
                            been the prime advocate of new Arab unity schemes. Next to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>, the two most influential <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members appear to be the Deputy Prime
                            Ministers, 26 year-old <persName corresp="#p_JJJAS1">Abd al-Sallam
                                Jaluud</persName> (production, industry, and economy) and 27
                            year-old <persName corresp="#p_HHAM1">Abd al-Munim al-Huni</persName>
                            (services, interior, and local government). Jaluud has played a
                            prominent role in dealing with Westerners; he handled the discussions
                            that led to the withdrawal of 6,000 US and British military personnel
                            from Libya, as well as two sweeping revisions of agreements with foreign
                            oil companies. Security is al-Huni's responsibility; he controls the
                            national police force, established by the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> to replace the tribal forces of the old regime, as well
                            as the foreign and domestic intelligence services.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. DOMESTIC OUTLOOK</p>
                        <p>4. The transformations in Libya's form of government and in its foreign
                            relations have not been matched by major changes in Libyan social
                            institutions or by a new role for the public in political life. The bulk
                            of the population—which numbers only about two million—remains poor,
                            agrarian, diseased, and illiterate. The social clock has been turned
                            back in some respects; the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> has
                            imposed conformity to traditional customs on an urban elite minority
                            that had become accustomed to a measure of social freedom. The educated
                            younger generation, deprived of opportunities for political expression
                            and participation under Idris, had high hopes for the new regime; these
                            have been frustrated.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> seems to be groping for some
                            kind of political structure that will satisfy desires for popular
                            participation without impinging upon the regime's freedom of action.
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members have discussed the
                            possibility of forming a single political party, presumably along the
                            lines of Egypt's Arab Socialist Union. <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has promised that a constitution will be
                            prepared and elections held at some unspecified time. The only overt
                            political action by the regime to date has been a series of popular
                            rallies addressed by individual members of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>; when members of the public presumed to criticize or
                            question the government on these occasions, however, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members seemed affronted.</p>
                        <p>6. Internal economic decisions have reflected uncertainty and
                            inexperience at the top. Following the coup, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> suspended work on many publicly-financed projects,
                            pending restudy of contracting procedures and awards, and the
                            construction industry suffered. Trade and banking also slumped,
                            especially when all major firms in both categories were forced to accede
                            to majority ownership by Libyans. Expulsion of the resident Italian
                            community (15,000-20,000 members) in mid-1970 eliminated most of the
                            skilled artisans and modern-sector farmers in Tripolitania. However, the
                            economic sectors most sharply affected were operated largely by and for
                            foreigners. Subsequent government actions have tended to revive sectors
                            of the economy <pb n="6" xml:id="d74-06" facs="d74-06"/>that benefit
                            Libyans. In May 1970, a new budget reinstated most of the suspended
                            projects and increased allocations for economic development. Some assets
                            that were foreign owned have been transferred to Libyans. On balance,
                            the average income and living standard of Libyans probably has changed
                            little since the revolution. Improvement, if any, has not been great,
                            and shortcomings in housing, employment, medical facilities, and
                            agricultural programs have given rise to complaints. A notable exception
                            is the military, which has received substantial boosts in pay and
                            perquisites.</p>
                        <p>7. Despite the many problems facing the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>, dramatic political changes do not seem likely in the
                            near future. There are no indications of differences of opinion within
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> serious enough to trigger a
                            rupture. Opposition from elements outside the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> seems likely to remain fragmented for lack of a single
                            compelling issue. If elections are actually held, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> presumably will be the only
                            candidate for chief executive. Oil revenues will continue to give the
                            regime sufficient resources to provide material goods more than adequate
                            to satisfy Libyan expectations, which are not high. The <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members do not seem disposed to focus
                            their energies on the mundane problems of providing jobs, housing, and
                            social services. They have concentrated on popular, emotional issues on
                            which they have achieved important victories. However, the regime risks
                            disappointing its constituency, now that such dramatic victories are
                            past. Over time it could face real trouble from within its own ranks or
                            from outsiders—e.g., a dissident group of military officers or members
                            of one or another pan-Arab political party.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">OIL</p>
                        <p>8. In its 1970 negotiations with the oil companies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> insisted on compensation for past low
                            receipts, especially in the early 1960s, when Libya was paid 10 to 15
                            cents per barrel less than the Middle Eastern average. It demanded a
                            posted price (1) increase, plus a very large payment representing a
                            retroactive increase in the posted price back to the beginning of
                            production for each company. To bring pressure on the companies to come
                            to an agreement, as well as for conservation reasons, the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> forced oil production down from 3.7
                            million barrels per day (bpd) to 2.9 million bpd. In the settlements
                            reached in September 1970, which featured playing off oil companies
                            against one another, the companies agreed to increase the posted price
                            and agreed to settle the retroactive claim by increasing the tax rate
                            from 50 to about 55 percent. As a result of the 1970 settlements, Libya
                            was assured about $1.4 billion in 1971 for roughly the same amount of
                            oil that provided revenues of $1.1 billion in 1969.</p>

                            of posted price; tax rates are applied to posted price less costs of
                            production and less royalties.</p>
                        <p>9. Since the September 1970 settlements in Libya, the international oil
                            industry has seen important changes. The 55 percent tax rate rapidly was
                            extended to most Persian Gulf producers, whose posted prices also were
                            increased somewhat. Venezuela unilaterally legislated higher posted
                            prices and an increased tax rate. The Organization of Petroleum
                            Exporting Countries (OPEC) met and agreed to cooperate in demands for
                            further increases in prices and other revenue measures. Libya
                            immediately announced demands in addition to those of OPEC—justifying
                            the demands by pointing out Libya's entitlement to retroactive
                            compensation. In an effort to avoid being whipsawed between Libya and
                            Persian Gulf producers, the oil companies succeeded in banding together
                            to carry out coordinated <pb n="7" xml:id="d74-07" facs="d74-07"
                            />negotiations in Teheran and Tripoli. A 5 year agreement was reached in
                            Teheran in February 1971 between the oil companies and the Persian Gulf
                            producers that set the minimum tax rate at 55 percent, increased posted
                            prices, and fixed a schedule for increasing prices through 1975.</p>
                        <p>10. New talks between the companies and the Libyans began almost
                            immediately after the Teheran agreements. Oil industry representatives,
                            wary of being victimized again by Libyan divisive tactics, mutually
                            supported each other and agreed on common offers. Deadlines were set,
                            approached, and passed. The Libyan negotiators alternately threatened
                            and cajoled. Oil officials from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria—all with
                            oil whose value would be affected by the Libyan settlement— announced
                            their support for Libya without committing themselves on the extent of
                            that support. After 6 hectic weeks, an agreement was signed which will
                            net Libya about $2.00 per barrel for oil produced during the remainder
                            of 1971 and as much as $2.30 in 1975. (Under the late 1970 agreement,
                            the Libyans had been getting $1.30 per barrel.) If production runs at
                            the 3.2 million bpd level of early 1971, therefore, Libya will receive
                            total oil revenues of about $24 billion in 1971. The oil industry
                            attained its principal objective—a 5 year agreement generally consistent
                            with the Gulf settlement. Libya, on the basis of geographical advantage
                            and low sulphur oil won a higher permanent differential between the
                            payments for Libyan oil and for Gulf oil and an industry-wide commitment
                            on future exploration activity. For all the histrionics and
                            brinksmanship, the Libyan regime demonstrated a clear understanding of
                            the international oil situation and a willingness to reach a negotiated
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>11. This is not to say that relations with the oil companies will be
                            tranquil in the future. The Libyans are determined and cocksure, and
                            they have shown themselves willing to get tough on occasion. They
                            undoubtedly will continue to make the oil companies pay a high and
                            rising price—in terms of revenues, reinvestment, and control of
                            operations—in exchange for the right to operate. They will probably find
                            excuses for reopening negotiations with one or more of the companies
                            well before the expiration of the five year contracts now in force. Such
                            a confrontation could be triggered by Libyan demands for higher prices,
                            for greater Libyan participation, or by political and diplomatic
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>12. While negotiating for higher revenues per barrel and imposing
                            production controls, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> also has
                            been pressing for a greater Libyan role in future oil operations. A
                            deep-seated interest in an independent oil production capability no
                            doubt is enhanced by the fact that almost 90 percent of current
                            production is controlled by US-owned companies, who are subject to
                            Libyan antagonism because of US support for Israel. During the 1970
                            negotiations, one company preferred to relinquish a small field rather
                            than continue operating in accord with Libya's demands; that field is
                            now being operated by the Libyan National Oil Company (<gloss
                                target="#t_LNOC1">LNOC</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> has announced that future concessions will be granted
                            only to joint ventures with LNOC, and all domestic oil distribution and
                            marketing facilities have been nationalized. The Libyans also have been
                            consulting with the Algerians on methods of dealing with foreign oil
                            companies. This could presage a Libyan move, along the lines developed
                            by Algeria in 1967, to gain a controlling voice in management of one or
                            more of the oil companies and control of their use of funds through
                            administrative fiat rather than legal change in ownership. All of this
                            would serve, among other things, to give Libyans badly needed experience
                            in the operation of the oil industry.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d74-08" facs="d74-08"/>
                        <p>13. The Libyans probably intend to take over the oil industry gradually,
                            rather than by outright nationalization; we believe the latter remains
                            unlikely, at least within the next year or two. Under the latest
                            agreement, Libya can count on revenues of at least $2.3 billion
                            annually. Nationalization would entail substantial loss of income, at
                            least for some months, and would require Libya to take investment risks
                            in exploring for new fields and developing new markets. The number of
                            Libyans capable of managing or participating in modern industrial
                            pursuits is extremely limited, and their talents are sorely needed in
                            other sectors of the economy. Our judgment is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> was not—and will not soon be—eager to
                            take on all the hazards and difficulties that nationalization would
                            entail. Therefore, the US balance of payments will probably continue to
                            benefit from substantial profit remittances from Libya for at another
                            couple of years—especially in view of rising prices for oil.</p>

                            Libya's military relationships with the outside world. Egypt has become
                            the primary—but not the sole—source of military training and technical
                            assistance, and Cairo appears to be using some Libyan facilities for
                            Egyptian purposes. The former <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> airfield
                            at El Adem, now <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> Air Base,
                            houses about 300 Egyptian personnel and some 30 to 40 Egyptian Mig
                            aircraft; on occasion, it is used as a dispersal field for Egyptian
                            bombers and transports. Egypt has about 200 army personnel nearby,
                            training Libyan units. There are also a handful of Egyptians in Ukbah
                            Bin Nafi (formerly Wheelus) Air Base, which is used by the Libyan Air
                            Force, assisted by Greek and Pakistani training missions. In 1970, when
                            Egypt was subject to Israel's deep penetration raids, the Egyptian Naval
                            Academy was transferred to Libya, but it was subsequently returned to
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>15. After obtaining the withdrawal of US und <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                                >RCC</gloss> attempted to continue those military supply contracts
                            negotiated by <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName> which it
                            approved—specifically those for jet aircraft from the US and Chieftain
                            tanks from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. For a variety of
                            reasons, including an apparent rebuff by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, however, it also turned expeditiously to France and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. For about $250 million,
                            France agreed to sell 110 Mirage aircraft during 1970-1974, and the
                            first delivery—of 6 planes—took place in early 1971. Libya also bought
                            Soviet arms; by the end of the year about $40 million worth of Soviet
                            equipment, including about 130 tanks, 24 self-propelled guns, 90
                            artillery pieces and 100 armored personnel carriers (<gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s) had been delivered. So far this year,
                            it has received at least 120 <gloss target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s from
                            Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            continues trying to negotiate arms contracts with the West.</p>
                        <p>16. Building an elaborate military establishment probably will remain a
                            principal aim of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, and ample
                            funds are available. Deliveries of Mirage aircraft are likely to proceed
                            more or less according to schedule—24 in 1971 (including the 6 already
                            delivered), and a similar number in 1972, even though the Libyans
                            probably will not be able to handle any number of the aircraft
                            operationally within the next year or two. Libya has already paid for 40
                            planes, and it probably would take an overt Libyan breach of the
                            prohibition on transfer to or stationing in another country to impel
                            Paris to break the contract. Since the Egyptians and Syrians cannot
                            provide competent pilots for all of their own Migs, we do not expect any
                            such transfer, although a few Egyptians probably would have been <pb

                            shortage will remain; moreover, the guidelines for the federation as we

                            federal—control.</p>
                        <p>17. Resolution of arms supply problems with the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> will be more difficult. The British have refused to sell
                            major weapons to the combatants in the Arab-Israeli confrontation, but
                            they would find it difficult to deny pending Israeli requests for
                            Chieftain tanks if they sell them to Libya, since Jaluud has publicly
                            insisted that all Libyan weapons will be available for the battle
                            against Israel. The Libyans under <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName> paid British manufacturers over $100 million as
                            down payments for arms which have not yet been delivered; if the <gloss

                            arms in place of missiles ordered by <persName corresp="#p_IIS1"
                                >Idris</persName>), the disposition of this money will be the
                            subject of a long legal dispute. If the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> decides to sell what Libya wants, it will probably get
                            additional military orders. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s most
                            likely course is to postpone any final action on this thorny question as
                            long as possible, hoping for some change in the diplomatic situation
                            that will make a sale more palatable politically. But the very large
                            amounts of money to be earned from arms sales to Libya, the British
                            vulnerabilities inherent in Libya's oil role and Libya's holdings of
                            sterling, and the rationale underlying the Conservative Government's
                            decision to sell arms to South Africa lead us to conclude that London,
                            if forced to decide, will eventually sell.</p>
                        <p>18. The Libyan purchases of Soviet-made weapons have not been accompanied
                            by any notable closeness in Libyan political relations with the <gloss

                            diplomatic representative in Moscow. The Libyans have refused to permit
                            Soviet military technicians to enter Libya to maintain Soviet-supplied
                            equipment. They have sent no military personnel to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for training. The Soviet cultural
                            exchange program continues to be sharply restricted, as it was before
                            the revolution, and Soviet diplomats continue to complain of
                            surveillance and rudeness. The number of Libyan students studying in
                            Communist countries has not increased beyond the level of 15 to 20
                            prevailing under <persName corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>. In sum,
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> looks on the Soviets in much the
                            same way as it does other European foreigners. The Russians, of course,
                            do have the virtue in Libyan eyes of consistent support for the Arabs

                            further deliveries are almost certain. At present, the Soviets are
                            willing and eager to provide desired equipment and other suppliers are
                            not. The refusal of the Libyans to accept Soviet technicians virtually
                            guarantees exasperating maintenance difficulties and continuing Libyan
                            complaints. If the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> again becomes a
                            major arms supplier, we believe that the Libyans would probably cut back
                            on purchases from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Even if
                            arms sales by Moscow continue, we doubt that Libyan-Soviet relations
                            will become close; the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is too
                            xenophobic for that, and it is not under the kind of threat that helps
                            make Egypt receptive to very close Soviet ties. In particular, we think
                            it highly unlikely that Soviet military air or naval units would be
                            permitted to operate from Libyan facilities in any guise—except possibly
                            in the context of major Arab-Israeli hostilities.</p>

                        <p>20. The importance of Arab issues and interests to the current Libyan
                            leadership is tremendous. Idris remained aloof from the <pb n="10"

                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> and company have plunged in.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has been the prime
                            mover in promoting various schemes for Arab unity. He has repeatedly
                            pressed the Egyptians to move forward on plans for unity faster than
                            they like. He has toured Arab capitals, often uninvited and without
                            prior warning of his impending arrival, ruffling tempers along the way.
                            He has loudly and simultaneously condemned King Hussein and extremist
                            Palestinians, to the obvious distress of both. He demanded that all Arab
                            states adhere to the <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            plan—which boils down to a united Arab nation ready to do battle with
                            Israel. He tried to embarrass all concerned into attending a summit
                            meeting at which a schedule for action would be drawn up. So far, all
                            this effort has had two obvious results: <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has won recognition in other Arab capitals as a
                            factor to be coped with on the Arab scene (albeit as gingerly as
                            possible), and <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> seems to
                            have become aware that all the sincere rhetoric in the world will not
                            necessarily inspire the Arabs to united action.</p>
                        <p>21. The close relationship obtaining between Egypt and Libya is a natural
                            outgrowth of the history of the two countries and the two regimes. For
                            most Libyans, Cairo has long been the intellectual and cultural capital
                            of their world. Although Libyan resentment of foreigners leads to
                            pedodic complaints about the sizable Egyptian presence, there is no
                            evidence that such frictions are growing. For the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members, <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> served as inspiration and model before the
                            revolution and as mentor immediately afterward. He seems to have had
                            considerable ability to influence their actions in the months between
                            the revolution and his death. With <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> gone, Egyptian influence on the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably has declined somewhat. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members probably are inclined to
                            see themselves—young and active revolutionaries—in favorable contrast to
                            an aging Egyptian leadership which has lost its revolutionary èlan.
                            Moreover the Libyan <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is undoubtedly
                            becoming less willing to seek advice in the light of it successful
                            confrontations with foreign governments and foreign oil companies.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> has been liberal with
                            money as well as words. In the 18 months since the revolution, he has
                            promised over $400 million to other Arab countries. He has actually paid
                            over about $250 million under these pledges, as well as about $150
                            million under commitments made by the Idris government. (See Table.)
                            Cairo has been the major beneficiary; without the $160 million or so
                            received from Tripoli in the last year, it might be suffering serious
                            financial difficulties. Jordan has been less fortunate; during the
                            September 1970 confrontation between Hussein and the fedayeen, Libyan
                            payments of $25 million annually due under the Khartoum agreement of
                            1961 were suspended, and they have not been resumed.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d74-11" facs="d74-11"/>

                        <p>23. Libya surely will continue to support Egypt financially in the
                            absence of a negotiated settlement with Israel, and the bilateral
                            relationship will remain important to both. Neither can easily afford to
                            antagonize the other seriously—at least in present circumstances; both
                            can gain from the friendship. Because of Cairo's financial dependence,
                            its advice will tend to be muted, while <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> will be inclined to assert himself as more of an
                            equal in the relationship.</p>
                        <p>24. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> will probably continue
                            to press for progress toward a federation of Arab nations. Plans for a
                            very loose union of Egypt, Libya, and Syria—with the Sudan free to join
                            at some unspecified date—have been announced. but the timetable for
                            implementation is long and the details of the arrangement are hazy.
                            Evidently the federal government—if and when it comes into being—will
                            act largely as a coordinating body for foreign policy. Initial reports
                            indicate that two of the three heads of state will be entitled to
                            override the third, but powers of enforcement are unspecified and
                            probably will not exist. As a practical matter, therefore, only
                            unanimous decisions are likely to be pursued with any vigor. Given the
                            disparate assets and interests of the member states, unanimity probably
                            will equate with blandness—in deeds, though not in words. All things
                            considered, we doubt that the federation will become much more than a
                            consultative and coordinating organization without substantial
                            supranational characteristics.</p>
                        <p>25. The strong ties between Cairo and Tripoli will continue to hamper
                            development of close relations between Libya and the other countries of
                            North Africa. Algeria obviously is interested in increasing its
                            influence <pb n="12" xml:id="d74-12" facs="d74-12"/>with the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, but not at any great cost to itself.
                            Common interest in oil provides a basis for Libyan-Algerian cooperation
                            in formulating negotiating positions. Algeria provides technical
                            assistance to the <gloss target="#t_LNOC1">LNOC</gloss>, and the Libyans
                            probably will continue to look to Algeria for inspiration in developing
                            an independent oil exploration and production capacity. They also seem
                            inclined, of late, to cultivate the general ethnic and cultural ties
                            they have with Tunisia. But the essential focus of Libyan attention will
                            almost certainly be eastward.</p>
                        <p>26. Despite all the activist rhetoric that has spewed forth from Tripoli
                            since the revolution, we do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> will involve more than token Libyan forces against
                            Israel. Libya has at most 19,000 military personnel; the bulk are men
                            with less than a year's service and minimal technical competence. In
                            short, Libya will not have the capacity to pose a measurable military
                            threat to any of its neighbors, much less to contribute significantly to
                            Egyptian capabilities against Israel.</p>
                        <p>27. Libya's financial capability to influence international developments
                            will, however, grow rapidly. Libya can be expected to use its money to
                            try to gain diplomatic support for the Arab cause and to encourage
                            “neutralism” in the East-West confrontation. At the current production
                            rate, annual revenues from oil will total $2.3 billion or more in each
                            of the next several years. Libya cannot possibly spend such sums for
                            internal purposes. Imports of civilian goods and services, excluding the
                            oil sector, now run about $700 million annually; a 50 percent increase,
                            which would be extremely difficult to absorb in Libya's circumstances,
                            would raise these imports to about $1 billion annually. Defense imports
                            currently are budgeted at abut $140 million a year; Libyan ability to
                            use even that amount is highly questionable. Thus, Libya probably cannot
                            spend much more than $1 billion a year for its own requirements. It will
                            have a minimum of $1.0-$1.5 billion annually in the next several years
                            to give away, put in the bank, or use to strengthen its position in the
                            oil industry (e.g., by buying tankers). Last year it gave away about
                            $260 million. If gifts and loans continue at about that level, Libyan
                            reserves would rise at the rate of $1 billion or more annually, perhaps
                            reaching $6 billion in 3 or 4 years. Even if foreign gifts and loans are
                            greatly increased or Libya spends heavily for oil-related investments,
                            and only $500 million, say, is added to reserves annually, Libya would
                            have $4 billion—as much hard currency as is now held by France or
                            Japan—within 5 years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Libya and the United States</p>
                        <p>28. The Libyans would like to buy some arms from the US, although this
                            probably is not now a vital element in bilateral relations. Pilot
                            training on US-supplied aircraft has been arranged with Greece and with
                            a private US firm. Most of the spare parts and technical services needed
                            to maintain Libya's small fleet of US-supplied military aircraft can be
                            obtained outside of direct US-Libyan official channels, albeit with some
                            difficulty and added expense. Far more important to the total
                            relationship will be the relationship between Libya and the oil
                            companies that develops in the months ahead, the role of the US
                            Government in oil matters, and—most critical—the Libyan assessment of
                            the US role in the Arab-Israeli situation.</p>

                        <p>29. Should something happen to <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would
                            probably stick together under a now leader. Jaluud is the most likely
                            one. He appears to be highly regarded by his colleagues as well as by
                            foreigners who have had the not always happy experience of negotiating
                            with him. As long as the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> is in
                            power, we would expect it to follow existing <pb n="13" xml:id="d74-13"
                                facs="d74-13"/>policies on almost all major issues. Indeed, even the
                            overthrow of the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> probably would not
                            lead to major changes in Libyan policy on oil. However, a new regime
                            probably would make some changes in other domestic policies and in
                            relations with the rest of the Arab world, and a successor might pursue
                            somewhat less militant policy toward Israel.</p>
                        <p>30. If relations between Libya and the oil companies should deteriorate
                            to the point of a drastic curtailment or total shutdown of oil
                            production and export by companies now operating in Libya, we believe
                            that Libya could produce and market a substantial amount of oil on its
                            own account. Libya has ample financial reserves to continue imports and
                            other foreign transactions for several years. And it would probably not
                            take long before Libya would find foreign purchasers (e.g., Germany,
                            Italy, France) willing to buy oil directly. Procurement of tanker
                            charters and hiring of technical assistance personnel would pose
                            difficult, but probably not insuperable, problems for the Libyans.
                            Libya's geographical position, the quality of its oil, its massive
                            production, and limits on excess capacity elsewhere are such that
                            attempts by other oil producers to replace Libya in European markets
                            would probably fall short of total success. In these circumstances,
                            however, direct Libyan sales certainty would remain well below current
                            exports for an extended period. If the Suez Canal were open at the time,
                            the problems for the Libyans would be greater.</p>
                        <p>31. Developments during an oil crisis could alter Libya's foreign
                            relations. Relations with the US would be severely strained; whether
                            diplomatic ties would be severed and trade with the US embargoed would
                            depend on Libya's assessment of the role that the US Government was
                            playing in supporting the oil companies. If a crisis involved a sharp
                            political conflict between Libya and the governments of the owner
                            companies (principally the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>), the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably would
                            hasten to offer goods, arms, and technical assistance on credit and earn
                            some political points in Libya thereby. Some Western governments (e.g.,
                            France, Italy, and Germany) might offer to negotiate for direct purchase
                            of oil from Libya. Within the Arab world, there would be pressure for
                            the other oil producers to back Libyan demands, but there are limits on
                            how far they would go—as there were this year. Any Arab producers who
                            attempted to take advantage of the situation at Libya's expense would
                            incur sharp Libyan displeasure.</p>
                        <p>32. A major outbreak of Arab-Israeli hostilities probably would have
                            similar effects in some respects. It probably would lead the Libyans to
                            expel the US official presence and might lead them to move against one
                            or more of the oil companies, as a means of hurting Israel's principal
                            arms supplier. It could cause a rearrangement of inter-Arab friendships,
                            as Libya would embrace those countries that fought hardest or talked
                            loudest against Israel, while shunning the others.</p>
                        <p>33. On the other hand, some sort of Arab Israeli settlement would create
                            indecision, confusion, and mental agony in Tripoli. The Egyptians,
                            conscious of their financial needs, would try to satisfy the <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>, but the kind of Arab concessions to
                            Israel inherent in almost any conceivable settlement would be viewed by
                            the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> as a sellout of the Arab cause
                            and the onus of Libyan blame would fall on Cairo. After the initial
                            shock wore off, however, the <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> would
                            probably realize that vocal opposition to a settlement would antagonize
                            Egypt without harming Israel. In the end, Libya would probably come to
                            accept the situation and might reduce its involvement in eastern Arab
                            affairs. In time, if the settlement held, the greatest single impediment
                            to US-Libyan relations would decline in importance.</p>

                        <p>Following your conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> on the question of the aircraft for Libya, that
                            we have three choices: (1) to delay further, (2) to seek further
                            assurances from the Libyans; and (3) to decide not to deliver the
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> continues to
                            believe that delivery of the aircraft is important to the US-Libyan
                            relationship and that a negative decision may precipitate a substantial
                            set-back to our efforts to improve cooperation. At the same time, he
                            believes strongly that he cannot continue to put the Libyans off as we
                            have for the past year, particularly in light of growing Libyan
                            pressures for a yes or no answer.</p>
                        <p>After further consultations with him, we are inclined to regard the idea
                            of requesting further assurances from the Libyans as inadvisable.
                            Although it is quite possible that the Libyans would be willing
                            privately both to give and to honor such assurances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s statements on the Mirages cast
                            doubt on the regime's willingness publicly and unequivocally to confirm
                            them. To explain to the press or Congress, even on a background basis,
                            the fact that they could not really be moved from Libya efficiently
                            could only breed resentment with the Libyans. There is also the question
                            of whether we would feel the general area situation and state of
                            domestic opinion <pb n="2" xml:id="d75-02" facs="d75-02"/>would warrant
                            a positive decision. In other words, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> would be opposed to requesting
                            the assurances unless we were prepared promptly to deliver the planes
                            provided the assurances were both positive and publicly useable.</p>
                        <p>We therefore believe that we should say no to the Libyans on the
                            remaining eight aircraft, taking advantage of the changed circumstances
                            clause in the original contract. We would express our willingness to
                            provide all necessary help for their utilization of the remaining
                            aircraft, but express the view that it is in our common interest to
                            phase out our military relationship.</p>
                        <p>We anticipate some perhaps strong expressions of unhappiness on the part
                            of the Libyans but do not feel it will result in any break in diplomatic
                            relations. We can probably anticipate that should any difficulties arise
                            on the Mirage arrangements; the Libyans will obtain aircraft from the
                            Soviets, probably using our refusal as an excuse. We should be prepared
                            to explain the rationale of our decision to the Egyptians in Cairo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> dissents from this decision and
                            argues for a postponement of it if a favorable decision to deliver the
                            planes cannot be made. Its argument for a postponement is based on the
                            desirability of us knowing more about the key aspects of the
                            newly-formed Federation of Arab Republics. We share Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName>'s view that he must have a
                            decision on this matter by the time he returns to Tripoli at the end of
                            May - which would be at least three months before the September 1
                            plebiscite called to ratify the establishment of the Federation. We
                            therefore regard <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s desire for
                            further delay as impractical, in addition to disagreeing with it on
                            substantive grounds.</p>

                        <p>You may recall that we mentioned to you last fall rumors of a plot by
                            some Libyans to try to free political prisoners in Libya and launch a
                            movement by them against the government. This has been on and off ever
                            since, and Dick Helms in the attached described some of the later
                            episodes. This is just to keep you informed.</p>
                        <p>The Plot: In January, the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> [text not
                            declassfied] were tipped off that a group of European mercenaries
                            (including British and French nationals) had been recruited to conduct a
                            commando raid against a prison in Tripoli with the objective of freeing
                            some 150 political prisoners, supplying them with arms and turning them
                            loose to form the core of a counter-revolutionary force within Libya.
                            The mercenaries were reportedly to use a ship known as La Caravelle,

                            that we would be blamed and that would jeopardize the oil negotiations
                            then going on. [text not declassfied] British mercenaries involved in
                            the plot were warned that their cover was blown and were advised to call
                            off the scheme. The upshot was that the mercenary leadership agreed to
                            do so, but not without passing a warning through its contacts that
                            another attempt would probably be made in the near future.</p>

                            SINCE JUNE 1970</p>
                        <p>A. The death of UAR President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Gamal Abdel
                                Nasser</persName> on September 28, 1970 was probably the most
                            significant event affecting Libya during the period under review.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s influence over
                            Libyan Revolutionary Command Council (<gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss>) Chairman <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            was considered a moderating force in post-coup Libya. Reportedly
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> counseled the Libyans
                            not to nationalize their oil industry, which consists predominantly <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d77-02" facs="d77-02"/>of American companies, and not
                            to press for a speedy development of the tripartite union between Libya,
                            the UAR, and Sudan, while at the same time advising them to maintain the
                            West as the primary supplier of Libyan military hardware. Although it is
                            too early to assess fully the ramifications of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s death upon Libyan/UAR
                            relations, the increasingly intimate relations of these states
                            exemplified by the “Tripoli Charter” appeared to be cooling by early
                            1971.</p>
                        <p>B. Relations between Libya and the more radical Arab states seemed at
                            first to become closer and then to wane during the period under review.
                            In the summer of 1970, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            proposed a plan to the capitals of the Arab states affected by the
                            Middle East confrontation. The <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> Plan, as it soon became labeled, called for a
                            more direct and aggressive confrontation with Israel by the Arab nations
                            and promised Libyan financial support for this action. In September
                            1970, Libya broke diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Jordan during
                            that government's struggle with the Fedayeen, and abrogated the Khartoum
                            agreement to make regular financial payments to Jordan. Early in
                            November 1970, plans for the political, military and economic
                            integration of Libya, the UAR, and Sudan were officially announced;
                            later the same month, Syria's candidacy began to be considered.
                            Simultaneously, the magnitude of the real barriers to Arab unity were
                            becoming <pb n="3" xml:id="d77-03" facs="d77-03"/>more and more apparent
                            to the Libyan leadership, and throughout the reporting period, there
                            were increased reports of <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                            >Qadhafi</persName>'s frustrations with these states and disillusionment
                            over the rejection of the <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            Plan throughout the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>C. The arrival of Soviet tanks and other military hardware in Tripoli on
                            18 July 1970 gave substance to the fears of many Western observers that
                            it was only a matter of time before the Soviet Union would be able to
                            exploit its Middle Eastern foreign policy objectives, which appeared to
                            be closely aligned with those of the post-revolutionary Libyan
                            leadership, and to utilize these common interests to increase Soviet
                            influence in Libya. In the wake of further breakdowns in arms
                            discussions between Libyan and British leaders, problems with the French
                            over the Mirage contracts, and the failure of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to deliver Northrop F-5's, the Libyan
                            military mission to Moscow during mid-November 1970 appeared to presage
                            increased Soviet participation in Libyan military affairs. But, the
                            first Mirage aircraft were turned over to the Libyans in December 1970
                            and the Libyans have continued to press the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> for the delivery of Northrop F-5's, and the British for
                            Chieftain tanks. The UAR <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> Squadron
                            has been isolated in Tobruk, and Soviet technicians <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d77-04" facs="d77-04"/>have been refused entry into the
                            country to supervise the use and maintenance of the Soviet
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>D. By September 1970, Libyan officials had successfully negotiated
                            settlements with all the major foreign oil producers in the country. The
                            agreement increased Libyan oil revenues approximately 20 percent over
                            the annual 1.2 billion dollars. The agreement also served as a catalyst
                            for new demands by the entire OPEC community. The mid-February agreement
                            between OPEC and the Persian Gulf producing oil companies served as a
                            foundation for additional Libyan demands on foreign oil companies.
                            Negotiations opened in Tripoli with Western oil companies in late
                            February and were successfully completed on 2 April. The new agreement
                            covers a five year period and may presage a period of comparative
                            stability in our commercial relations, instead of the friction and
                            frustration of the recent past.</p>

                            OBJECTIVES RELATED TO CURRENT LIBYAN SITUATION</p>
                        <p>A. Make the Libyan authorities aware that the U.S. is prepared to live
                            with a Libyan regime which is truly independent and free of Soviet
                            influence in order to continue the maintenance of diplomatic and
                            commercial relations between Libya and the U.S. The fact that the U.S.
                            accepts an independent Libya was directly conveyed to the leadership of
                                <pb n="5" xml:id="d77-05" facs="d77-05"/>the UAR via President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> before his demise and
                            indirectly to the Libyan authorities through a variety of [text not
                            declassified] means. The reiteration of this theme and Libya's failure
                            to find evidence of a <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> role in any of
                            the anti-regime activities appears to have had a salutary effect upon
                            the Libyan leadership and to have tempered the short-term Libyan actions
                            against the U.S. in the diplomatic arena. Although the U.S. has little
                            leverage left with the Libyan leadership, it is believed they are
                            unlikely to break diplomatic relations with the U.S. in the near future.
                            Since the U.S. is viewed by the Libyans as the primary supporter of
                            Israel, a settlement of the Palestine issue and a subsequent reduction
                            of tensions in the Middle East would be needed to increase significantly
                            U.S. chances of maintaining friendly relations with Libya in the
                            long-term, and of further developing its commercial interests there.</p>
                        <p>B. Convince Libyan leaders of the value of continuing the major American
                            role in the development of Libyan petroleum. Attempts undertaken to
                            convince the Libyan government that the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> accepts the new Libyan leaders may have assisted in
                            creating the viable atmosphere in which the American oil producers were
                            able to arbitrate their differences with the Libyan authorities and
                            arrive at an amicable agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d77-06" facs="d77-06"/>
                        <p>C. Convince the Libyan authorities of the dangers of allowing Soviets,
                            Chinese Communist or other Communist influence in their country. [text
                            not declassified] operations have probably reinforced the existing fear
                            of communism and communists among the Libyan leadership. Only when the
                            Libyans were denied access to first line military hardware of the West
                            did they purchase Soviet tanks and other Soviet military hardware and
                            reiterate their intention to procure arms from the best sources of
                            supply whether East or West. They have remained steadfast in opposition
                            to entry of Soviet technicians to supervise the use and maintenance of

                        <p>E. Promote the goal of an independent Libyan State with balanced
                            attachments to the Maghreb and the UAR. This objective has become more
                            feasible as the young Libyan leadership's ideals of Arab unity have
                            become tarnished by the realities of the significant divisions among the
                            Arab states. After <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            death, the problems of coordinating their common efforts were increased.
                            The training of Libyan troops in the UAR initially proved to be a
                            failure, the establishment of a joint naval academy in Susa (Libya) was
                            completely unsuccessful, and efforts to establish free trade and border
                            controls have been plagued with problems. As these difficulties between
                            Tripoli and Cairo have increased, the Libyans have commenced to increase
                            their interaction with the other Maghreb states. On 8 December 1970, the
                            Libyan <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> ratified a Libyan-Tunisian
                            technical cooperation agreement, and in January 1971, Libya and Algeria
                            initiated closer cooperation on oil issues.</p>
                        <p>F. Discourage any marked increase in Libyan involvement in the support
                            for hostilities against Israel; <pb n="8" xml:id="d77-08" facs="d77-08"

                            support to efforts by radical Arab governments or movements to overthrow
                            moderate Arab regimes. The new Libyan revolutionary government offered
                            to “bankroll” an increase in hostilities against Israel shortly after it
                            had consolidated its position in Libya. In September 1970, Libya broke
                            diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Jordan during the latter's
                            struggle with the Fedayeen and supported the Government of Syria's
                            effort to assist the Fedayeen against Jordanian troops. While Libya has
                            been widely asked for financial assistance and indications of Libyan
                            willingness to grant this aid have been reported, there is no hard
                            information available that Libya has actually disbursed all the aid it
                            had promised. For example in September 1970 the Libyan Director of the
                            Budget received instructions that money due to the Palestinian commandos
                            for the period 1 August to 1 December 1970 should not be sent to them,
                            but should be used for Libyan internal development purposes.</p>

                        <p>In the first sixteen months following the revolution there have been at
                            least seven counter-coup attempts within Libya and an additional one
                            initiated from Chad. All of these efforts were successfully neutralized
                            by the Libyan authorities. <pb n="9" xml:id="d77-09" facs="d77-09"/>

                            military officers who are in diplomatic and other posts abroad. The
                            group is allegedly coordinating anti-regime activities among Eastern
                            Libyan Tribal groups and oppositionist “second level officers” within
                            the Libyan military. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> uncovered a second plan
                            involving a maritime operation to land a small European mercenary force
                            in Libya to release 150 political prisoners from the Tripoli prison. The
                            released prisoners, all active in official capacities under the former
                            regime, would disperse into the countryside to form the nucleus of an
                            anti-regime force.</p>
                        <p>Two attempts have been made to carry out this second plan—one in late
                            January/ early February and the second in late March/ early April. If
                            these attempts had succeeded in actually landing mercenaries for the
                            operation planned, the results would have been disastrous. The
                            mercenaries might conceivably have succeeded in freeing the prisoners,
                            but there was no chance that the ultimate purpose of the operation could
                            be accomplished, i.e., forming a resistance group to overthrow the
                            regime. The mercenary force was too small <pb n="10" xml:id="d77-10"

                            would also almost certainly have had a catastrophic effect on the

                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> objectives in Libya remain intact.
                            The U.S. continues to maintain diplomatic ties with Libya. The U.S. oil
                            companies have continued to operate in Libya. There has been no
                            discernible increase in Soviet influence over the new Libyan government.
                            The influence of the UAR and other radical Arab states has not proved
                            intolerably inimical to U.S. interests in the area. Finally, Libyan
                            resources have not been utilized in significant amounts to affect the
                            balance <pb n="13" xml:id="d77-13" facs="d77-13"/>of peace and war

                        <p>1. The State Department is in general agreement with Sections I-III of
                            the subject memorandum [<hi rend="italic">text not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] Diplomatic efforts by
                            the Embassy, increasing self-confidence and experience among the Libyan
                            leaders, and area developments undoubtedly were also factors at
                            work.</p>
                        <p>3. The Department believes caution is needed in estimating the extent and
                            duration of the somewhat favorable elements in the current Libyan
                            situation, particularly as they may relate to the regime's attitude
                            toward the United States. Our future military relationship to Libya
                            remains undefined, and the regime is still unaware of our intentions
                            with respect to delivery of the eight F-5s. Although an oil pact has
                            been signed, only time will indicate its stability and the future of the
                            American companies. Libya's attitude <pb n="15" xml:id="d77-15"
                                facs="d77-15"/>toward the Middle East question continues to differ
                            sharply from our own, and its subsidy to Jordan has not been resumed.
                            The impact of the newly-announced Federation on Libyan policies is also
                            obscure; at a minimum, it would appear to signal a turning away of Libya
                            from cooperation with the Maghreb.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] frustrating two coup
                            attempts against the Libyan regime was most helpful. Some measure of
                            Libyan confidence in US attitudes toward the regime may have resulted
                            from the ability of the Embassy to alert the regime to the second of
                            these plots.</p>
                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] The Department wishes
                            only to point out that the size of the American presence in Libya
                            undoubtedly remains a matter of interest to the Libyan regime [text not
                            declassified] It believes the personnel profile proposed by the
                            Ambassador would be consistent with our desire not to draw undue
                            attention to the American official presence in Libya and consistent as
                            well with the attainment of Option 1-A.</p>

                        <p>In approving this paper, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> has stressed the importance of viewing U.S.
                            policy towards Libya not just in bilateral terms, but also in the wider
                            context of other significant U.S. interests and policies in the area
                            which condition all our relations with Libya. These include: (1) the
                            dependence of Europe on Libyan oil production and on U.S. oil companies
                            as suppliers, set against the unpredictable character, relatively
                            unrestrained freedom of action and aggressive oil policies of the
                            present Libyan regime; (2) the increased Soviet presence in the
                            Mediterranean combined with the reduction of Western (U.S., <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Italian influence in Libya since the
                            1969 coup; (3) the U.S. commitment to a peaceful solution of the
                            Arab-Israel conflict and to the security of Israel, set against Libya's
                            militant Arab nationalist posture; and (4) the fluid inter-Arab
                            political situation, including the evolving nature of the Arab
                            Federation.</p>
                        <p>In examining these considerations, it should be born in mind that we are
                            dealing with a primitive, largely illiterate people of under two
                            million, living in a country with presumed limited (apart from oil)
                            natural resources, and led by relatively inexperienced and unpredictable
                            men. Libya's income from oil revenues will soon be $2 billion a year,
                            and her foreign exchange reserves may, in five years, equal those of
                            Italy. How this enormous wealth will be used, and what will happen
                            politically and economically as a result, remains very much to be seen.
                            The American oil companies have retained their predominant position in
                            Libya, and the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> appears to be
                            inclined to turn to the U.S. for its technological needs. 450 Libyan
                            students are in the United States, and some movement of non-petroleum
                            oriented technology and capital towards Libya is discernible.</p>
                        <p>We are deliberately keeping a low official profile in Libya, and the next
                            months and probably years will be the ones of watchful waiting and
                            patient efforts to help keep the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>
                            on a moderate and sensible track. It follows that some of the listed
                            “U.S. objectives” are more properly described as “hopes.”</p>

                        <p>1. Libyan oil is a critical factor in maintaining the economic and
                            military position of our NATO allies.</p>
                        <p>2. Our efforts to promote a political accommodation between Arabs and
                            Israelis, as well as the genuine independence and non-alignment of the
                            Arab States, can be seriously affected, positively or negatively, by the
                            LAR's use of its wealth.</p>
                        <p>3. A combination of the LAR's geographic position and the possibility
                            that Soviet military influence might spread westward from the UAR
                            involves our strategic interests in the North African littoral, in the
                            Mediterranean and in NATO's southern flank in general. Our strategic
                            interests are essentially negative in Libya. It would be contrary to our
                            interests for Libya to be utilized by a hostile power capable of
                            effective military action against NATO.</p>
                        <p>4. An American community numbering approximately 3,900.</p>
                        <p>5. Private American investment of more than one billion dollars in the
                            Libyan petroleum industry. The industry has been a major contributor to
                            the U.S. balance of payments ($828 million in 1969).</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'s own economic development
                            objectives make it a significant, if not a major, market for our capital
                            goods and our technical, scientific and managerial services.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. U.S. Objectives Over the Next Five Years</p>
                        <p>1. Maintenance of the flow of oil to Western Europe, preferably through

                        <p>2. Preservation of the US private interest in Libyan oil whether through
                            present or transformed nondiscriminatory arrangements which would assure
                            a continued return from the LAR to the US balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>3. A <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> tolerant of, if not confident

                        <p>5. Increased understanding on the part of the Libyan public of U.S.

                        <p>7. A LAR prepared to turn to U.S. suppliers and service organizations for
                            the implementation of its development plan, thus building a U.S.
                            “presence,” of sufficient importance to Libya, to “cushion” us from

                        <p>2. A change in U.S. policy on the Arab-Israeli issue, using whatever
                            leverage is available without causing fundamental damage to the <gloss

                        <p>3. Increased LAR control over the oil industry and its share of petroleum

                        <p>5. Access to US technological resources, where clearly superior to

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<lb/>WASHINGTON<lb/>2 DEC 1971</p>
                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>
                            <lb/>Secretary of State<lb/>Department of State<lb/>Washington, D. C.
                            20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>As you know, our Ambassador to Libya has asked for guidance in explaining
                            the absence of a U.S. decision on Libya's requests for major military
                            equipment (F-5s, C-130s and 175mm artillery). Concurrently, the Spanish
                            Ambassador has asked Alex Johnson for a U.S. position on an export
                            license for five F-5s from the Spanish plant (CASA) for delivery to
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me the Spanish request might offer some promise for partially
                            resolving our dilemma. We could instruct Joe Palmer to tell the Libyans
                            quite frankly that (i) our decision on their requests is tied to our
                            overall arms policy to the Mid-East; (ii) in view of the present
                            situation, we wish to limit arms deliveries to all countries in the
                            area, and we cannot, consequently, give an answer to their requests at
                            this time; (iii) in deference to our relations with Libya we are
                            prepared to approve a Spanish request for an F-5 export license for a
                            limited number (up to eight) of F-5Bs (the trainer version); and, in the
                            meantime, we will continue to review Libya's other requests against
                            developments in the area.</p>
                        <p>While this may not be completely satisfactory to the Libyans, it would
                            demonstrate some forthcomingness on our part. This would also allow us
                            to release the aircraft we have had earmarked for the Libyans and avoid
                            further storage costs. There is, of course, always the risk of some
                            unfavorable publicity, particularly since the F-5Bs might be linked to
                            training Libyans to fly the Mirages being delivered from France. I would
                            think, however, that the non-combatant nature of the aircraft and the
                            indirect role of the U.S. would tend to mitigate such criticism.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that this is not an easy decision. I believe, however, that
                            the course I have proposed would be least disruptive to our Mid-East
                            posture while at the same time offering some promise of maintaining our
                            considerable interests in Libya. I continue to believe those interests
                            will be best served by avoiding the appearance of closing the door
                            completely on their requests.</p>

                        <p>The Libyan Radio and Libyan News Agency announced December 7 the
                            nationalization of British Petroleum's subsidiary in Libya, <gloss

                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> may have been nationalized because of
                            Libya's intense dissatisfaction with what it believes is the <gloss

                            Persian Gulf islands. The seizure may also have reflected <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> frustration over its inability to
                            resolve a long-outstanding financial dispute with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> centering around the aborted sale of a
                            missile defense system by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to the
                            former regime for which the monarchy had made a substantial down
                            payment.</p>
                        <p>In seizing <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> Libya, the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> hits the British government as well
                            as the company, since <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> owns nearly 50
                            percent of the parent company. Libya announced a new company will be
                            formed, the Arabian Gulf Prospecting Company, to take over <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'S assets.</p>
                        <p>With production in Libya of 200,000 barrels per day, <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> is one of the largest oil producing and
                            exporting companies there. Its importance to us is that it operates in
                            equal partnership with Nelson Bunker Hunt of Texas. There was no
                            indication Libya intends to take over Bunker Hunt or to nationalize
                            other companies. However, <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> was the
                            operator of the joint <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>-Bunker Hunt
                            concession. If <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> withdraws its
                            personnel, there may be temporary difficulties in finding technicians to
                            carry out oil operations in that concession area. The Libyan action will
                            also throw a fright into the other oil companies, chiefly American,
                            regarding their future.</p>

                        <p>The British Embassy in Tripoli expressed fears December 4 that Libya
                            might take some drastic move against British interest, including a break
                            in diplomatic relations. As yet, there is no indication either side
                            intends to break relations. However, earlier unconfirmed reports
                            indicated Libya was transferring funds out of London. Its total funds
                            there probably amount to over $2 billion. If confirmed, this transfer
                            obviously might pose major financial problems, at least temporarily, for

                        <p>Dear Mel:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter of December 2, 1971 recommending that we permit
                            the Spanish firm (CASA) to sell five F-5's to Libya.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the need of maintaining our considerable interests in Libya.
                            For that reason I have declined to shut the door completely on sales of
                            major military equipment to Libya. However, I also do not believe it
                            possible at this time to permit the Spanish to transfer F-5's to the
                            Libyans for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>Political reasons predominate. There have been no signs of any Libyan
                            moderation in Middle Eastern affairs. On the contrary, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> still espouses armed conflict as
                            the only means of settling Arab-Israeli problems; his behavior still
                            remains erratic as shown by the December 7 nationalization of <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> Petroleum; Libyan funds support the
                            Fedayeen and there are now confirmed reports of the arrival in Syria of
                            Libyan commandos to support the Fedayeen; only a few months ago the
                            Libyans supported the coup in Morocco and still are causing difficulties
                            for the Government of Chad and Eritrea. The F-5's, whether from the US
                            or Spain, will be clearly identified as American aircraft and will be so
                            regarded by Libya's neighbors, including Arab governments friendly
                            toward the United States. I believe the political sensitivity of this
                            sale is not diminished by the fact that deliveries would be of <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d81-02" facs="d81-02"/>the F-5B trainer version, especially
                            since the Libyans have told us they want these aircraft to train pilots
                            to fly Mirage jets from France. All interested parties would know that
                            US Government approval is required for sale of the F-5s from Spain to
                            Libya. I do not believe we can or should appear to be enhancing Libyan
                            combat capability by facilitating the Libyan transition to Mirages.</p>
                        <p rend="right">The Honorable<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Melvin R. Laird</persName>,<lb/>Secretary of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>There are legal aspects as well. In January, Congress passed an amendment
                            to the Foreign Military Sales Act (Section 9) providing that consent to
                            a third country transfer of defense articles should not be given unless
                            the U.S. itself would transfer the defense article under consideration
                            to that country. For policy reasons, we are not prepared to permit
                            Northrop to provide F-5's to Libya at this time. Thus we are constrained
                            under Section 9 from allowing the Spanish firm to do so.</p>
                        <p>I recognize the problems for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName> in continuing to tell the Libyans that this sale
                            remains under review. However, having carefully considered the
                            alternatives, including your suggestion, I believe we should continue to
                            hold to the line. We will review this position, of course, should any
                            major developments in the area or in our bilateral relations with Libya
                            justify doing so.</p>
                        <p>I regret that I could not be more forthcoming to your recommendation.</p>

                            British Petroleum (<gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p>On December 7, the Libyan Government nationalized <gloss target="#t_BP1"
                                >BP</gloss>'s Libyan subsidiary, but the decree did not include
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s 50 percent American partner,
                            Bunker Hunt. Bunker Hunt is trying to cooperate with the Libyans to the
                            extent of keeping production going but has refused a Libyan request that
                            it market the ex-<gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> share of the oil as
                            well as its own. The Department has agreed to support the request of the
                            American oil companies operating in Libya for a business review letter
                            from the Department of Justice that will allow them to act in concert in
                            support of <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>, which intends to take
                            legal action against any purchasers of oil from its concession.</p>
                        <p>On December 10, the British Government requested US support for its
                            demarches to major oil consuming countries, and for a press statement by
                            us deploring the use of nationalization as a political weapon. The
                            request for a press statement was subsequently withdrawn. The British
                            intend to request governments of consuming countries not to purchase oil
                            from the nationalized concession and further to use their influence to
                            dissuade their oil companies from purchasing such oil.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d82-02" facs="d82-02"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>Several considerations weighed against our supporting the British
                            demarches. The Libyan action against <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>
                            occurred at a time of rising Libyan frustration over long unsettled
                            claims against the British (former British base rights, a cancelled air
                            defense system contract, non-delivery of Chieftain tanks) which were
                            purely bilateral in nature and had nothing to do with the United States.
                            It carefully avoided action against any US companies in Libya, including
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s American partner. Any US
                            Government action in support of <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> or the
                            British which became known to the volatile and unpredictable Libyan
                            Government could precipitate Libyan retaliation against American
                            interests in Libya. Moreover, the American oil companies had not asked
                            us to take any action with regard to the nationalization beyond
                            supporting their request for a business review letter. The British, with
                            no substantial interests left in Libya, would have little to lose in
                            fighting the nationalization to the end; the United States would be
                            risking a great deal in supporting such an all-or-nothing policy. It was
                            also argued that our support for the British demarche would have very
                            little if any real effect on consuming governments. Nor would any
                            British or combined British-US action to foreclose the market ever
                            induce the nationalistic Libyans to reverse their nationalization and
                            return the concession to <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the Libyans followed up their nationalization of
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> with successful marketing of the
                            oil to <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> members, it would
                            inevitably weaken our own interests in Libya as well as other oil
                            producing states. Failure by the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>,
                            and particularly the US, to support the British in this instance would
                            compromise, perhaps fatally, the common front through which the
                            consuming countries and the oil companies hope to blunt the OPEC drive
                            for higher oil prices and eventual control of the companies. To the
                            degree that the Libyans nationalization could be made difficult, it
                            would serve to inhibit further such actions. By supporting the British
                            and maintaining some measure of consumer state solidarity, we would in
                            effect be supporting our own interests through the oil companies' joint
                            front tactics vis-à-vis OPEC.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion and Action:</p>
                        <p>On balance, the long range consequences of not supporting the British
                            seemed likely to be more serious than the immediate risk of provoking
                            Libyan Government action against our interests there. Moreover, the
                            Senior Review Group discussions on expropriation consistently favored
                            steps to organize consumer state solidarity in resistance to
                            nationalizations. Our maintenance of a common front now on Britain's
                            behalf should also be useful to us in other future contexts, such as the
                            Chilean nationalizations.</p>
                        <p>We have accordingly agreed to instruct our embassies in <gloss

                            British demarches, urging the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            governments to use their influence with their national oil companies and
                            refineries not to accept <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>'s

                            <lb/>Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs<lb/>Washington,
                            D.C.</p>
                        <p>Dear <persName>David</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I followed with great interest your recent trip and gather it was most
                            successful. Numeiri's backtracking was disappointing, although he seems
                            clearly to be moving in the right direction and the amount of time he
                            devoted to you was most impressive.</p>
                        <p>During your absence, our military supply problems have continued to
                            plague us. I had hoped to catch you in Europe on your way home to
                            discuss my concerns, but the telegram I sent to Khartoum suggesting this
                            missed you and I learned from Curt Moore that you would not be pausing
                            long in London.</p>
                        <p>I am therefore taking this means of letting you know of my
                            continuing—even increasing—concern with the accumulation of military
                            supply problems we are facing. To make things easier for you, I am
                            attaching the references.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. F-5's</p>
                        <p>I know—and accept—that the “no decision” is the Secretary's decision.
                            What I have difficulty in understanding, however, is why, when I propose
                            a reply to YUNIS which is entirely consistent with the Secretary's line
                            with only slight non-substantive embroideries, I get no answer at all
                            from the Department. (See Tripoli 2167—para 2—TAB A)</p>
                        <p>Nor do I understand why, when I ask for some Washington approved language
                            to explain our “no decision”, I again meet with the same silence. As you
                            well know, Libyans, like <pb n="2" xml:id="d83-02" facs="d83-02"
                            />everyone else, ask questions. I just cannot continue to face them,
                            smile in a friendly manner, and say in effect that Washington has made
                            no decision but that I (1) don't know; (2) can't say; 3) won't tell; (4)
                            am too embarrassed to discuss/choose one/why!</p>
                        <p>I note that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> in his
                            memorandum of December 2 (TAB C) to the Secretary suggests that we
                            explain our problem on the basis of our wish to limit arms deliveries to
                            all countries in the area in the light of the general situation. I
                            believe that this would be particularly dangerous: (a) Are we actually
                            going to deliver the F-5's to Libya if we decide on further Phantom
                            deliveries to Israel? (b) Are we going to deliver the F-5's if there
                            should be some improvement in the area situation? I doubt that the
                            answer would be affirmative on either score. Similarly, it has been
                            informally suggested at various times in the past that the rationale
                            might be tied to the incompatibility of various Libyan actions with US
                            interests in the area. I think this would be even more dangerous and apt
                            to provoke an even worse confrontation than a flat turn down.</p>
                        <p>The fact of the matter is the Department has left me for about 18 months
                            now with no credible and presentable explanation for our failure,
                            inability or unwillingness to take a decision. Perhaps the problem is
                            that those responsible for answering our telegrams cannot come up with a
                            satisfactory rationale either. I am frank to say that I can't, but it
                            might help clear the air between Tripoli and the Department if we were
                            told frankly that Washington can't either.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, because of the Department's failure to address specifically
                            either of the two matters on which I requested guidance in paras. 2 and
                            3 of Tripoli 2167 (TAB A), I have lost the initiative with YUNIS and I
                            am vulnerable once again to further importunings by him or by other
                                <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members pressing for some sort
                            of a response, and I shall have to go all through the sorry charade
                            again. I could understand the deafening silence if I had been pressing
                            for a reconsideration of the “no decision” policy, But I was not
                            pressing for such a reply. I was merely asking for an updated
                            reiteration of “no decision” tailored to a particular approach, and for
                            some additional guidance to explain the “no decision”. A month later I
                            have received nothing other than the pear-shaped second paragraph of
                            State 220238 (TAB B) which could equally as well have come by sea pouch
                            as by Immediate telegram.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d83-03" facs="d83-03"/>
                        <p>Incidentally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>'s
                            suggestion for licensing the F-5's from Spanish production (see Jim
                            Blake's letter of December 6—TAB C) seems on the surface to offer a
                            possibly attractive way out of our commitment. At the same time, the
                            planes would presumably have to be built from scratch with a
                            considerable delay in delivery time compared with the US model which the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> assumes are in storage and
                            ready for delivery anytime the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
                            prepared to release them. Since the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss>'s principal desire is to get the planes quickly for
                            transition training to the Mirages, they are unlikely to be mollified by
                            this offer. Moreover, from a Washington point of view, I remain dubious
                            about circuitous ploys of this kind. If we are concerned about
                            Congressional and public reaction to US F-5 deliveries to Libya, we
                            certainly run the risk of being pilloried even more by resorting to what
                            many would regard as a subterfuge in making the planes available through
                            the less than popular Spanish! We tried this with Pakistan via Turkey
                            several years ago and got clobbered!</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. C-130's</p>
                        <p>Enough on F-5's. Turning to the C-130's, let me first make clear my
                            concern that our Lockheed friends are playing fast and loose with us. At
                            least informally for the record, I would like to make several comments
                            on Cowden's letter of December 1 to you (TAB D). In the first place, I
                            have not seen or heard any sort of a satisfactory explanation from
                            Lockheed as to how the quantum jump from 4 to 8 aircraft took place, and
                            I cannot escape the suspicion that Lockheed itself may have encouraged
                            this increase in the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> request to
                            help solve the problem of its Marietta production line. Is there any
                            reason why the Department should not press Lockheed for an explanation
                            of this rather important new dimension of the problem? Secondly, I find
                            it strange that Cowden never mentioned to me that Farjani had told him
                            that failure to license the additional C-130's could result in a break
                            in diplomatic relations with the US. (All Cowden told me was that
                            Farjani had said that such failure could result in expulsion of the
                            Lockheed team, the “burning” of the present 8 planes, and the
                            acquisition of Soviet transport aircraft.) Again, I suspect that the
                            “break in relations” bit has been added after the fact in an effort to
                            influence the Department. Thirdly, I never told Cowden that I “did not
                            anticipate any problem in regard to Lockheed's air drop equipment and
                            training <pb n="4" xml:id="d83-04" facs="d83-04"/>program.” I did tell
                            him before he saw Farjani that I had recommended a favorable Department
                            response to the licensing application for the air drop equipment, adding
                            that I could not however say what the ultimate decision would be.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I was not in favor at the outset of permitting Lockheed to
                            proceed with discussions with the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss> for additional C-130's. I was wrong in permitting
                            myself to be persuaded at that time that Lockheed explorations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>, without commitment, would not
                            do any harm. It has done harm and added another horn to our present
                            dilemma. Nevertheless we started down the road and, if our objective is
                            to avoid confrontation, it seems to me that the present logic of the
                            situation is to permit Lockheed to go ahead with their contract and to
                            face up to the licensing problem in 1973. Meanwhile, like the baseball
                            team whose pitcher hasn't shown up, we can always pray for rain!</p>
                        <p>However, I agree with Jim Blake that we should not let Lockheed maneuver
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> into turning a blind eye on,
                            thereby tacitly approving, a type of contract that is misleading and
                            that will therefore give us even greater trouble with both the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> and Lockheed. I refer particularly to
                            paragraphs 2 c and d of Mr. Cowden's letter to Jim of December 3 (TAB
                            E). Taken together they will lead, almost certainly, to a situation
                            where the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> has a claim against
                            Lockheed for return of advance payments—due to the export licenses not
                            being forthcoming from the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Again,
                            we will be in the middle, where Lockheed wants us.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Air Drop Equipment</p>
                        <p>The next subject I would like to raise is air drop equipment, I simply do
                            not understand the Department's reasoning in turning down this license.
                            This decision has already badly undermined the credibility of our “no
                            decision” on the F-5's and C-130's. (who will believe we will license 8
                            additional military C-130's if we won't license air drop equipment?)
                            Although I continue to believe we should have approved the request, it
                            seems to me that at the minimum we should have placed the item in limbo
                            with the F-5's and C-130's.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I would like to raise once again the question of the Sikorsky
                            helicopters which was the subject of our 2228 (TAB F), The only reaction
                            we have had to this message has been <persName corresp="#p_CWJ1">Warren
                                Clark</persName>'s short note of December 7 to Charles Marthinsen
                            (TAB G) saying that there has been “no approval by Sikorsky for the sale
                            of helicopters to the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>”, but that
                            “We would certainly want to look very closely at any such request,” I do
                            not know what “no approval by Sikorsky” means, but assume that “no
                            application by Sikorsky” was intended. In any event, the intent of our
                            telegram was to suggest that somebody contact Sikorsky, find out what
                            they have in mind, tell them right from the beginning that they haven't
                            got a Chinaman's chance of getting the necessary licenses, and urge them
                            to lay off. In short, we should do now with Sikorsky what I wish we had
                            done from the beginning with Lockheed. At least with Sikorsky there has
                            not been, as far as I know, any approach to the <gloss target="#t_LARG1"
                                >LARG</gloss> so we do have a chance to avoid the problem.</p>
                        <p>I regret the complaining tone which the foregoing recital of problems
                            conveys, I know the clearance problem on formal communications on such
                            sensitive and complicated problems, but informal channels are open to at

                        <p>January 7, 1972</p>
                        <p>Dear Joe:</p>
                        <p>Your letter of December 22 rings very sincerely with the frustration I am
                            sure you are encountering in the absence of decisions or further
                            instructions on the questions of military supplies to Libya.</p>
                        <p>As disappointing as it may be, I feel I have no alternative but to say
                            that I see little likelihood of change. Having been at least four times
                            up to the Secretary on this matter, Alex Johnson and I do not feel we
                            are in a position to go again in the absence of some genuine change in
                            the circumstances surrounding the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary's reasoning is thus: The absence of a decision, while it
                            has undoubtedly been difficult to live with in Tripoli, has not brought
                            any marked reaction from the Libyans. No one is able to make a
                            convincing case to him that the absence of a decision increases the risk
                            of an adverse Libyan reaction. This feeling is accentuated by the
                            impression that, if the Libyans for their own reason desire to move
                            against the interests of the United States, they will find reasons to do
                            so, no matter what we do. All of this is accompanied by a feeling that
                            any initiative, such as one with Colonel YUNIS, would not be helpful and
                            only tend further to aggravate the situation. The Secretary feels that a
                            negative decision could on the other hand provoke a reaction which the
                            absence of a decision will not.</p>
                        <p rend="right">The Honorable<lb/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Joseph Palmer</persName> 2nd,<lb/>American
                            Ambassador,<lb/>Tripoli, Libya,</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d84-02" facs="d84-02"/>
                        <p>While, therefore, not wanting to make a negative decision, neither does
                            he feel he can make a positive decision, givan various Libyan third
                            country adventures, without running into serious public relations and
                            Congressional problems here. NEA is convinced the Israelis would make a
                            major issue of even symbolic shipments because of the active Libyan
                            support for Palestinian extremism.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary feels that his instructions are clear and, for this reason
                            has not been interested in further communications or instructions on the
                            problem. We were, perhaps, remiss in not replying to 2167, but, as you
                            can see, there was little more that could be said. There the matter
                            stands. He knows that there are risks in this policy given <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s erratic character, and he
                            knows very well of your concerns. In the absence of some major new
                            development, however, or of some compelling argument for being more
                            precise, he simply will not change his view that our best position is
                            the one he has repeatedly adopted.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as the C-130s are concerned, you should by now have received the
                            report of my conversation with Messars. Cowden and Monro of Lockheed. I
                            believe they have no doubt regarding the Department's attitude toward a
                            contract with the Libyans which the company almost certainly could not
                            execute. Mr. Cowden, as a good salesman and representative of his
                            company, is determined to get this sale because of the real threat to
                            the existence of the Lockheed-Georgia plant unless its production line
                            can be assured. He has promised, however, to convey the Department's
                            views to the company's management and to let us know what its decision
                            will be. If the decision is to go ahead with the contract, then we will
                            seek the intervention of higher levels of the Department with Lockheed's
                            top management.</p>

                        <p>You asked about air drop equipment. Our refusal to license it for export
                            to Libya has nothing to do with the proposed additional eight C-130s for
                            the <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> since the equipment could be
                            used on the C-130s that <gloss target="#t_LARAF1">LARAF</gloss> now
                            possesses. I see no reason why the Libyans should conclude that the sale
                            of the original C-130s implied a willingness on our part to sell
                            everything else that could augment the capability of the planes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWJ1">Warren Clark</persName> received a
                            representative of United Aircraft on January 4 in connection with the
                            company's interest in selling helicopters to Libya. By now you should
                            have our cable on that subject as well as that reporting my conversation
                            with the Lockheed representatives. While I understand your desire that
                            we tell United Aircraft or others that we are opposed to the sale to
                            Libya of helicopters having a major military role, I am satisfied that
                                <persName>Warren</persName>'s exposition to the United Aircraft
                            representative satisfactorily reflected for the time being our position
                            regarding the sales in question.</p>
                        <p>I know how it is to receive a letter like this, but I have no choice. If
                            you have further arguments either for some new initiative or for a new
                            policy let us have them. Meanwhile, we here see little way out of the
                            impasse.</p>

                        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency has forwarded a report to us on the above
                            subject which I believe should be brought to your attention. This report
                            indicates that a preliminary agreement has been reached by which the
                            Libyan Government will loan approximately three million dollars without
                            interest to the Nation of Islam (NOI), more commonly known as the Black
                            Muslims.</p>
                        <p>NOI is a radical black organization which advocates the establishment of
                            an independent black nation in the United States, preaches hatred of the
                            white man while teaching strong puritanical self-disciple for its black
                            followers, and purports to follow the Moslem religion. Founded in the
                            1930's by Elijah Muhammad, the self-styled “Messenger of Allah,” NOI has
                            established temples throughout the country and a lavish headquarters in
                            Chicago. Its most prominent follower, until a split led to his
                            assassination, was Malcolm X. More recently, younger dissident elements
                            have started open warfare with the NOI leadership and sparked violent
                            confrontations such as the recent incident in Baton Rouge, La. which
                            resulted in four deaths.</p>
                        <p>In mid-December Herbert Muhammad, the son of Elijah Muhammad, met in
                            Tripoli with Libyan Prime Minister Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM1"
                                >Mu'ammar Qadhafi</persName> to request aid. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> agreed to lend NOI one
                            million Libyan pounds (about three million dollars) without interest on
                            the assumption that the money would be used to establish church
                            facilities for teaching the Arabic language and the Islamic religion.
                            The loan was to be consummated through the Libyan Ambassador to the
                            United States, Abdullah Suisi.</p>
                        <p>Investigations by Ambassador Suisi and Minister of Religious Affairs
                            Bashir Al Saghir Al Hawadi have convinced them that NOI is not a Moslem
                            organization in the true sense of the word and that any financial
                            assistance received by them would go toward the personal betterment of
                            Black Muslim leaders. Both Suisi and Hawadi have recently attempted to
                            persuade Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            that no loan should be made. As of January 25, the Ambassador had not
                            yet released the funds to NOI.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>By an exchange of notes in Tripoli February 5, we have terminated nine
                            bilateral agreements with Libya, including the military base agreement
                            of 1955. Most of these agreements were related to our presence at
                            Wheelus Air Force Base and had no longer served any useful purpose
                            following evacuation of the base in June 1970. Included in the exchange
                            of notes was an agreement we had sought to a mutual washout of financial
                            claims arising from the agreements.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Libyan Government, we have also agreed to withdraw
                            the Military Liaison Staff (<gloss target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss>) from
                            our Embassy in Tripoli by March 15. The mission of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss> was to assist the Libyan armed forces
                            in procurement of military supplies, which has recently covered items
                            such as spare parts for existing equipment purchased from the US prior
                            to the coup in 1969. The request for withdrawal of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MLS1">MLS</gloss> may be connected with our reluctance to
                            approve exports of major military equipment to Libya such as F-5s and
                            C-130s. Libya also recently requested withdrawal of British military and
                            naval missions.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE<lb/>WASHINGTON<lb/>1 MAR 1972</p>
                        <p>Honorable <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William P. Rogers</persName>
                            <lb/>Secretary of State<lb/>Department of Stat<lb/>Washington, D. C.
                            20520</p>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>The imminent termination of the F-5A production line reduces and
                            complicates the possible options open to us in handling the Libyan F-5
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Since June 1971, when we released the six F-5As from storage, we have
                            relied on earmarking aircraft from future production for Libya in order
                            to avoid storage costs. The last aircraft from the production line,
                            earmarked for Libya, will be completed at the end of March. One <gloss
                                target="#t_RF1">RF</gloss>-5 is currently in storage, and one F-5B
                            is on 30-day recall.</p>
                        <p>We must now consider whether we want to continue to defer a decision on
                            delivery and place the aircraft in storage, or choose from the other
                            options that have been proposed in the past, e.g., agree to deliver
                            eight F-5Bs (trainers) or agree to a delivery from the Spanish
                            facility.</p>
                        <p>Storage costs (about $1850 for each aircraft a month) will become
                            increasingly difficult to fund and, while adding to unit costs, diminish
                            the possibility of selling them to other recipients. Consequently, we
                            need to resolve this matter at an early date and, in any event, before
                            the end of March.</p>
                        <p>The legal restriction raised in your letter of 15 December—that we are
                            constrained by Section 9 of the Foreign Military Sales Act from agreeing
                            to third-country transfers of equipment that the U.S. itself is not
                            willing to transfer—only applies to equipment sold under <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> or provided under grant <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. I understand that the U.S. Air Force
                            has determined that the Spanish F-5 facility is supported entirely from
                            commercial sources. Consequently, the constraints under Section 9 would
                            not arise.</p>
                        <p>I believe our considerable interest in Libya can best be promoted by
                            offering to deliver the trainer version, preferably from the U.S. but
                            alternatively from Spanish production (similar to the proposed Italian
                            M-113 sale). Despite the nil practical effect of such deliveries on the
                            Mid-East arms balance, I recognize the potential for a publicity effort
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d87-02" facs="d87-02"/>to argue the contrary.
                            Juxtaposed against our recent substantial and highly publicized aircraft
                            sales to Israel, I can only conclude that an effort to ballyhoo the sale
                            of eight trainers would fall flat. A decision to provide F-5Bs
                            ourselves, however, would have to be made before April 1, in order to
                            avoid a significant break in the production line and the associated much
                            higher costs.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> recommended sale of the
                            F-5B either from US or Spanish production. He also asked you to resolve
                            the problem raised by storage costs for the aircraft. We propose that
                            you inform Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> that: (a)
                            the sale of F-5s to Libya is being held in abeyance; (b) if our policy
                            changes in the future we plan to offer F-5B trainers and (c) we
                            therefore agree to the sale to other countries of the F-5As presently in
                            storage but we wish to keep available for delivery to Libya the one
                            F-5B.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Foreign Minister requested US approval to sell Spanish
                            assembled F-5Bs to Libya. The proposed reply informs him that you desire
                            to hold in abeyance for now a decision on delivery of F-5s to Libya from
                            the US and that we thus cannot agree at this time to the sale from

                        <p>The Libyan Ministry of Unity and Foreign Affairs told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> May 30 that the
                            Libyan Government considers it necessary to limit the US Mission to
                            seven diplomatic and seven administrative American members in Tripoli
                            and Benghazi. There are now 35 Americans at the two posts in Libya.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> was told there
                            were no political reasons for the reduction. The Note from the Ministry
                            said the reductions were because of the prevailing conditions in the two
                            countries; the imbalance of the number of members of the Libyan mission
                            in the US and the US mission in Libya; and the lack of resources
                            (including human resources) at the Ministry of Unity and Foreign Affairs
                            which makes it impossible to undertake the necessary coordination.</p>
                        <p>We are not sure what connection there may be between this and the recent
                            reductions in the US Interests Section in Cairo. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Mission was reduced to the same number of
                            positions. We understand the French and Soviet Embassies may also be
                            reduced. It may be that the Libyans view this reduction as some sort of
                            first step towards their cherished goal of consolidating the Foreign
                            Ministries and foreign policies of the three members of the
                            Confederation of Arab Republics.</p>
                        <p>We are awaiting recommendations from Ambassador <persName

                            that each of the three options presents risks, tends toward option two.
                            He would recommend that we try clearly to separate the oil question from
                            the arms question and talk to the companies about an approach to the
                            Libyans which would emphasize the need to avoid abrupt and hostile
                            action against the companies when they may be moving toward
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>I tend to favor fulfilling our contract on the F-5 aircraft without
                            seeking a specific quid pro quo on the oil company matter. This would
                            remove an obvious irritant in our relations with Libya and might clear
                            the way for less hostile discussions of our overall relations in the
                            future. The rationale of proposing to begin the delivery of the aircraft
                            could be the changed situation in the area, as well as our desire to
                            improve relations with Libya.</p>

                        <p>We have several indications suggesting that Libya may be seriously
                            contemplating the partial (51%) or complete nationalization of one or
                            more of the 13 U.S. companies which currently account for 90% of Libya's
                            production.</p>
                        <p>Senior executives of the companies were summoned to Libya June 9 and were
                            urged by Major JALLUD, currently the Libyan Prime Minister, to urge the
                            U.S. Government to change its policy in the Middle East and its policy
                            on arms supply to Libya. A threat to move against the companies was
                            implied.</p>
                        <p>Major al-Huni, another high ranking member of the regime, coupled the
                            arms supply question with our Middle East policy in telling Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1">Palmer</persName> on July 10 why he
                            saw little prospect for cooperation between the United States and
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence reports indicate that Libya may be preparing to nationalize
                            some or all of the companies on or about September 1, the third
                            anniversary of the military coup. Although such reports have been
                            current in the past, these appear to have more substance to them. Libyan
                            nationalization of the industry would be consistent with what we know of
                            the aim of the Libyans to control their oil, the intense Libyan
                            dissatisfaction with our policy in the Middle East and Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s desire to use oil as a
                            political weapon against the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d90-03" facs="d90-03"/>
                        <p>The Libyan regime also resents our refusal to supply it with certain
                            fighter aircraft which were contracted for by the former government and
                            for other military equipment (C-130's, howitzers, and possibly
                            Sidewinders) which were not contracted for but which they have requested
                            over the past two years. Particularly at issue are eight F-5 aircraft
                            sold to the old regime in 1969 before the coup but not yet delivered and
                            eight additional C-130's offered to them by Lockheed. We have been
                            unwilling to give assurances that we would issue export licenses for
                            these aircraft in 1973. The fact that we have continued to license spare
                            parts for the F-5's and other military equipment we sold to them and
                            that we have authorized the Italians to sell Libya armored personnel
                            carriers, howitzers, recoilless rifles and ammunition which we control
                            through production licenses has not lessened the Libyan Government's
                            resentment against our restrictive arms policy.</p>
                        <p>Nationalization of the Libyan oil industry would be a severe blow to
                            American interests. The industry represents a billion dollars (book
                            value) of U.S. private investment, although some of it (Esso) has
                            apparently already been largely written off. The industry returns as
                            much as $400 million annually to our balance of payments. It produces
                            about two million barrels of oil a day, chiefly for Western European
                            markets, which would be irreplaceable. Loss of the oil, coupled with the
                            shutdown of the Iraq Petroleum Company, would almost certainly force
                            European consumers to come to terms with both Iraq and Libya, possibly
                            bypassing the U.S. companies and discounting any U.S. official
                            opposition. The position of those in the Arab world and elsewhere who
                            wish to nationalize American assets would be strengthened. The move
                            toward nationalization has already gained momentum in the Persian Gulf
                            area and elsewhere in OPEC.</p>

                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> has
                            recently discussed the Libyan situation twice with oil company
                            executives at the senior vice-presidential level, reviewing for them
                            what we might do to head off nationalization. The executives expressed
                            the hope that the U.S. might find some symbolic gesture it would make,
                            at least to buy time.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">We believe we have three options:</p>
                        <p>1. We could offer to deliver the eight F-5's for which we signed a
                            contract in 1969 (in the trainer version now desired by Libya). As a
                            symbolic gesture we might offer to deliver two planes by the end of the
                            year and the rest within a year. The purpose of this action would be
                            two-fold: to buy time during which perhaps the Libyans would not take
                            any precipitate action against our companies, and to buy enough time for
                            Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States to negotiate with the oil companies a
                            reasonable settlement of the “participation” issue. We believe the
                            chances of a reasonable settlement would be diminished if the Saudis and
                            the other moderates were confronted by a total Libyan takeover of the
                            American companies; in such circumstances they would find themselves
                            under pressure to nationalize completely as well.</p>
                        <p>Even if the Libyans were to respond positively to our offer and we were
                            to obtain a few months time, the basic problem would not be solved.
                            There can be no guarantee that this or any other offer to Libya of a
                            modest arms supply relationship will be effective, even in the short
                            term. We believe Libya will move against the companies whenever it
                            believes it can extract the maximum political and economic advantage.
                            Arms deliveries will not permanently deflect Libya from such a move; at
                            best, they may delay it. Such a delay should make a satisfactory
                            settlement of the oil companies in Iraq more probable and should make
                            the move toward total nationalization throughout OPEC less likely <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d90-05" facs="d90-05"/>over the near to mid-term. One
                            of the serious disadvantages of this option is that it would link arms
                            supply and oil in the Libyan mind, thereby opening us to Libyan
                            blackmail.</p>
                        <p>We must recognize nevertheless that the Libyans are attaching importance
                            to obtaining some arms from us despite their extensive acquisitions from
                            the French and the Russians. This is the only action they have hinted
                            could lead to improved relations with the U.S. or at least to a less
                            hostile attitude toward the oil companies. Under this option we would
                            make clear to the Libyans that we expect improved relations would follow
                            this gesture. If at any time during the period of the delivery of the
                            aircraft Libya moved against the companies, shipments could be stopped
                            and so could shipments of spare parts for the aircraft and other
                            equipment of American origin that Libya now has in its inventory.
                            Although Libya could assume that its ploy of linking arms and oil had
                            worked and could ask for more sophisticated equipment (such as
                            Sidewinders and C-130's), each new case could be discussed for a long
                            period and deliveries prolonged over an extended period of several
                            years. Libyan oil will decline in relative importance during the next
                            decade, and any additional time the companies might have to operate in
                            Libya would be valuable.</p>
                        <p>Although Israel could be mollified by an advance warning of our action
                            and an explanation of it, any supply of arms to Libya would present
                            grave problems both domestically and with more moderate countries in the
                            Mediterranean area. Libya has intervened in the internal affairs of
                            Morocco, has supported extreme Palestine groups, and has supported
                            dissidents in numerous countries.</p>
                        <p>2. We could support orderly nationalization. The greatest threat in Libya
                            is that of an abrupt and hostile nationalization which would cut off oil
                            supplies and jeopardize the payment of compensation to the
                            companies.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d90-06" facs="d90-06"/>
                        <p>Under this option, subject to consultation with the companies, we would
                            indicate to the Libyans that we recognize their desire for increased
                            participation and that we will not oppose participation along lines
                            agreed upon between Saudi Arabia and Aramco. At the same time we would
                            urge the Libyans not to undertake any sudden or preemptive
                            nationalizations since this would obviously create difficulties for the
                            kind of smooth transition which is in the interest of all parties. We
                            would emphasize that we continue to believe that future production rests
                            on arrangements between the companies and Libya in which the U.S.
                            Government and its official policies are not involved.</p>
                        <p>Saudi Arabia and Aramco are currently negotiating a partial
                            nationalization which would begin with a 20% participation by the
                            government in Aramco increasing to 51% probably over a period of five
                            years. At least two of the American Aramco partners and probably a third
                            are resigned to accepting such an arrangement with the most serious bar
                            to agreement probably residing in the terms for compensation. The
                            settlement reached in Saudi Arabia is to apply also to Libya in
                            accordance with the OPEC arrangements. Most of the American companies in
                            Libya are prepared to accept this fact, but their willingness to do so
                            has not been communicated by them to the Libyans who may, in any event,
                            want more than 51% and want it sooner than five years.</p>
                        <p>If the U.S. were to accept the option of orderly nationalization and
                            indicate its acceptance to the Libyans, it would be taking a step less
                            palatable to the oil companies than a “symbolic” political or military
                            gesture. Also, it could put the U.S. in the position of appearing to
                            support nationalizations. The option could not be exercised without
                            further high level consultations with the companies.</p>
                        <p>The main advantage of this option would be its separation of the oil and
                            arms supply issues from each other. Having <pb n="7" xml:id="d90-07"
                                facs="d90-07"/>received from us an indication that we accepted the
                            principle of nationalization, Libya would know that it could not use the
                            threat of nationalization to force military supply or political
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>3. Take no action. On the assumption that the Libyans will proceed to
                            nationalize on their own timetable and that any intervention on our part
                            is not likely to be effective, we could take no action.</p>
                        <p>While there are signs of a clear Libyan intention to move at some point
                            against some or all of the companies, we have no firm evidence that they
                            have made such a decision. We have no certainty that the interventions
                            proposed under options 1 or 2 would achieve the purpose of buying time
                            or deterring nationalization. We have made clear to the Libyan
                            Government and to the companies our current policy of not supplying arms
                            to Libya. Although the companies would like to have us make a symbolic
                            gesture, they understand the difficulties we face in doing so. The
                            Libyans probably do not expect further moves from us.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances we could continue to talk with the Libyans
                            along the lines of our present policy but take no action specifically
                            with respect either to the planes or to the question of
                            nationalization.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantages of this are that it leaves us open to charges that we
                            have not been sufficiently active in protecting the major American
                            interests involved. The advantage would be that it would not draw us
                            further into the efforts by Libya to use the companies to extract arms
                            and changes in policy from us.</p>
                        <p>We are submitting the foregoing for your review and for such guidance as
                            you desire to give the Department in this matter.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to share with you an inside view of the
                            situation in Libya as it may affect our oil companies there over the
                            next month or so. Those companies live under the constant threat of
                            cutbacks in their production, and now we have reports that the
                            government is planning to nationalize three of them on September 1, the
                            anniversary of the Libyan revolution. The US government has been brought
                            into this situation — ostensibly because of our arms policy toward Libya
                            but actually because of our policy toward the Arab-Israel problem.</p>
                        <p>The event which led to the present situation took place in mid-June when
                            Libyan oil negotiator and now Prime Minister JALLUD called in the heads
                            of the oil companies doing business in Libya and told them that their
                            position is jeopardized because of the US government policy of refusing
                            to provide arms to Libya. He exaggerated in describing Libya requests to
                            the US which he said had been turned down, but as you know there are
                            still 8 F-5 aircraft dating from a commitment made prior to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s takeover which have never been
                            delivered. We agreed to sell them at a time when we were working with
                            the Libyan air force as a means of holding our position at Wheelus
                            Airbase. After the revolutionary command deposed King <persName
                                corresp="#p_IIS1">Idris</persName>, we held the remaining eight
                            aircraft under that contract “under review,” and that is still their
                            status. Another dimension of this problem for the future is that the
                            Libyans have ordered 8 C-130s through commercial channels for delivery
                            next year, and the issue of licensing them will come up at some
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The situation within Libya provides the reason why we have been as
                            reluctant to say “no” as we have to say “yes” on the F-5s. We have <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d91-02" facs="d91-02"/>not said “yes” because of the
                            problem of appearing to support the radical Libyan regime. However,
                            among those people working most closely with Dick Helms on this problem
                            there is a view that failure to release those planes is a major
                            irritant. They feel that whatever moderation exists in Libya today —
                            particularly toward our oil companies— is the work of one very strong
                            faction headed by Al Houni, who is the Minister of the Interior and the
                            head of the intelligence and security services. He is third in power to
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>, although he lacks
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s charisma and does
                            not have a popular base. He does have a substantial in-government
                            following among those who feel that Libya should maintain its
                            relationships with Western Europe and the US. It is <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s judgment that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s more radical instincts would
                            dominate if it were not for Al Houni and his faction.</p>
                        <p>Here is where the aircraft come in. Apparently Al Houni has argued [text
                            not declassfied] that the issue is not so much the aircraft in
                            themselves because the Libyans have more than they can handle in the
                            French Mirages but the fact that the US appears to be applying some sort
                            of double standard to Libya by refusing to honor a previous contract. Al
                            Houni points out that the nationalization of British petroleum interests
                            in Libya was the result of a flash reaction to British arms policy. He
                            feels the same could happen to the US companies.</p>
                        <p>No one argues that fulfilling the terms of the original contract would
                            buy us a significantly different situation in Libya. Our basic problem
                            is that we are dealing with a government that has no time for us because
                            of our Arab-Israeli policy. Libyan attitudes toward us are not likely to
                            change until the Arab-Israeli situation changes, if then. However, one
                            school of thought argues that releasing the aircraft would remove the
                            one specific bilateral bone of contention between our governments. There
                            would be plenty of continuing issues in the Arab-Israeli dispute, but
                            there would be no remaining bilateral evidence that the US was somehow
                            treating Libya differently. The oil companies have not pressed us to
                            release those aircraft, but if some of them are nationalized after the
                            approach that has been made to them on pressing our government to change
                            its arms policy, there will be some room for criticism.</p>
                        <p>This is one of those situations where there seems to be no answer. It is
                            difficult to see us releasing even 8 F-5s to Libya now — and equally
                            difficult to believe that it would change the Libyan attitude toward us
                            significantly. At the same time, it is not difficult to see further
                            moves against the oil companies, although that is not certain in the
                            immediate future. <pb n="3" xml:id="d91-03" facs="d91-03"/>The only
                            steps one can envision in this situation are small and may not do much
                            good. [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this memo is to check the above views against yours. The
                            main question I would put to you for my own guidance is: Do you sense
                            such potential pressure from the oil companies as to warrant serious
                            consideration of releasing at least a couple of the 8 F-5s now with a
                            tentative promise to release the rest next year?</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You have indicated that you thought we “should consider” releasing the
                            eight F-5 aircraft which the Libyans want and asked how we would
                            proceed.</p>
                        <p>We could begin by asking State for its views. As it turns out, however,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has just
                            completed a review of our arms policy toward Libya and has concluded
                            that “any modification of the present arms supply policy would not buy
                            much, if any, security for American oil companies.” This was based on
                            the view that the Libyans are probably bent on nationalizing the entire
                            oil industry and will do so no matter what we do whenever it best suits
                            their political and other purposes. It was also concluded that the
                            major, and probably overriding, factor determining U.S.-Libyan
                            relations, and probably also the future of the oil companies, is the
                            intense Libyan hostility towards our policy on the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the Secretary has decided that there should be no change in
                            our present policy of providing no new weapons to Libya, but attempting
                            to avoid a direct “Yes-No” confrontation over the F-5s. Spares for
                            previously supplied equipment, including aircraft, will continue to be
                            sold and the U.S. approval of the Italian sale of U.S. origin <gloss
                                target="#t_APC1">APC</gloss>s and artillery will remain in effect.
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> has
                            informed the oil companies.</p>
                        <p>The problem, therefore, boils down to whether or not you wish to override
                            State on this one or ride along with the actions they have just taken to
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d92-02" facs="d92-02"/>revalidate the present
                            policy. If you did want to go ahead, it would probably mean selling all
                            eight aircraft, since dribbling them out would not reduce and might even
                            raise Libyan sensitivities. This could be done in a low-key way but,
                            given the situation in the Middle East, could not be kept secret.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that this is not a particularly good time to change our
                            Libyan arms policy. For one thing, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> is an anathma to the Israelis because of his
                            strong support of the fedayeen, financial subsidizing of Egypt and
                            tending to push Sadat toward radical solutions. He is also opposed to
                            Arab friends like Kings Hussein, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and Faisal and has made contributions to radical
                            groups in the U.S. like the Black Panthers. But more important is the
                            fact that the hostile Libyan attitude toward the U.S. is not likely to
                            change until the Arab-Israeli situation changes, if then. As for the oil
                            companies, from all indications they are living on borrowed time in
                            Libya no matter what happens, so long as the present regime remains in
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That we stick with the present arms policy toward Libya
                            subject to later review if the situation changes.</p>

                            UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR THREE YEARS TO SETTLE THIS MATTER. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> BELIEVES THAT F-5's POSE MAJOR ISSUE
                            BETWEEN US AND LIBYA ASIDE FROM PALESTINE PROBLEM. NOTING THAT US IS
                            PROVIDING ISRAEL WITH PHANTOMS, KIKHIA ASKED WHY LIBYA CANNOT RECEIVE
                            EIGHT OR NINE F-5'S.</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SOMEWHAT SINCE
                            CONTRACT SIGNED. HE ASKED HOW MANY MIRAGE AIRCRAFT LIBYA NOW HAS. <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID INVENTORY IS SUPPOSED TO REACH 100
                            BUT NOW STANDSAT ABOUT 30. SECRETARY EXPRESSED US CONCERN ABOUT WHAT
                            LIBYA APPEARS TO BE DOING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. <gloss target="#t_FM1"
                                >FM</gloss> REPLIED THAT LIBYA IS FIGHTING AGAINST COLONIALISM.
                            SECRETARY ASKED WHAT <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> WOULD DO WITH
                            ADDITIONAL F-5's. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> REPLIED THEY WOULD
                            BE USED FOR DEFENSE. SECRETARY ASKED AGAINST WHOM. <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> STRESSED THAT LIBYA NEEDS AIR FORCE FOR
                            ITS DEFENSE AND SEES US STANCE ON DELIVERIES OF F-5's AS PRESSURE
                            AGAINST IT. SECRETARY SAID THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT LIBYA SHOULD
                            HAVE ARMED FORCES TO ENSURE ITS DEFENSES. HOWEVER, US IS CONCERNED ABOUT
                            SIZE OF LIBYAN MILITARY FORCE. KIKHIA POINTED OUT THAT IT WILL BE MANY
                            YEARS BEFORE LIBYA HAS ENOUGH PILOTS TO FLY ITS AIRCRAFT. MOREOVER,
                            THERE IS NO QUESTION OF LIBYAN AIR FORCE PLAYING OFFENSIVE ROLE. LIBYA
                            NEEDS GOOD AIR FORCE BECAUSE IT IS VERY LARGE COUNTRY, WITH VERY LONG
                            BORDERS. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> SAID THAT US IS
                            CONTINUALLY CONSIDERING QUESTION OF F-S'S BUT <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
                                >GOL</gloss> SHOULD KNOW THAT ISSUE INVOLVES PHRASE IN CONTRACT
                            LIMITING, AIRCRAFT TO DEFENSIVE PURPOSES AND PROHIBITING THEIR TRANSFER
                            TO OR USE BY COUNTRIES OTHER THAN LIBYA. FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETIME AGO
                            LIBYAN F-5's WERE SENT TO PAKISTAN. THIS POSED DIFFICULT LEGAL PROBLEMS
                            FOR US. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> STRESSED THAT US
                            MUST BE SURE THAT F-S'S WILL BE USED FOR PURPOSES STIPULATED IN
                            CONTRACT.</p>
                        <p>6. KIKHIA SAID THAT WHEN <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> WORKED OUT
                            AGREEMENT ON WHEELUS, IT CONCLUDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO REMAINING
                            COMPLICATIONS IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH US. ON PURELY BILATERAL SIDE,
                            MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF PETROLEUM ACTIVITY IN LIBYA IS BY US COMPANIES.
                            US SHOULD NOTE THAT LIBYA IS ONLY COUNTRY IN AREA WHICH FIGHTS SO HARD
                            AGAINST COMMUNISM. LIBYA MAY DISAGREE WITH US ON MID-EAST ISSUE, BUT
                            THAT IS MID-EAST MATTER. SECRETARY SAID US DOES NOT MIND DISAGREEING
                            WITH LIBYA ON MID-EAST; IT ALSO DISAGREES WITH SOME OTHER ARAB STATES.
                            HOWEVER, WHAT DOES CONCERN US ARE VITRIOLIC ATTACKS WHICH COME FROM
                            LIBYA. CERTAIN <pb n="3" xml:id="d93-03" facs="d93-03"/>LIBYAN
                            STATEMENTS HAVE SUGGESTED <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss>
                            INTERFERENCE IN AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. KIKHIA ASKED WHETHER
                            SECRETARY WAS REFERRING TO IRELAND. SECRETARY SAID HE WAS REFERRING TO
                            LIBYA'S NEIGHBORS, WHICH HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT LIBYA'S ATTITUDES.
                            SECRETARY SAID US WANTS GOOD RELATIONS WITH LIBYA. THIS WAS PROVEN WHEN
                            US VACATED WHEELUS WHEN <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> ASKED, EVEN
                            THOUGH LEASE HAD NOT YET EXPIRED. KIKHIA SAID LIBYA HAS NO REAL QUARREL
                            WITH US BUT IS DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT US CONTINUES TO SIDE WITH LIBYA'S
                            ENEMY, ISRAEL.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> REMARKED THAT US WONDERS
                            WHY <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> ATTACHES SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE
                            TO F-5 CONTRACT. ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP SEEMS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO BOTH
                            LIBYA AND US. MOREOVER, IT MAY BE IN BEST INTERST OF US AND LIBYA TO END
                            MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. LIBYA'S POSITION ON MID-EAST AND OTHER ISSUES
                            FRANKLY MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP.
                            KIKHIA AGREED THAT LIBYA WISHES TO PRESERVE CULTURAL TIES WITH US,
                            ESPECIALLY PROGRAMS TO SEND LIBYANS TO US UNIVERSITIES. HE SAID,
                            HOWEVER, THAT F-5 PROBLEM LOOMS LARGE. SECRETARY TOLD <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> THAT US WILL CONTINUE TO EXAMINE
                            QUESTION. (IN A BRIEF MEETING FOLLOWING SESSION WITH SECRETARY, MAGHUR
                            TOLD <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> LIBYANS WOULD BE
                            PREPARED RETURN ALL PRESENT F-5's TO US AND WIPE OUT CONTRACT IF US SO
                            WISHED. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> SAID HE WOULD SO
                            INFORM SECRETARY BUT REPEATED THAT SECRETARY DESIRED TAKE FURTHER LOOK
                            AT QUESTION OVER NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.)</p>
                        <p>8. MID-EAST: SECRETARY SAID THAT US IS EAGER TO FIND SOLUTION TO MID-EAST
                            PROBLEM. US HAS NO QUARREL WITH ARABS AND MOST OF THEM SEEM TO LIKE US
                            BETTER THAN COMMUNISTS. THIS MAY BE BECAUSE ARABS KNOW THAT US IS NOT UP
                            TO ANYTHING. <gloss target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> SHOULD KNOW THAT US
                            RECOGNIZES JUSTICE OF PALESTINIAN CLAIM. PROBLEM IS HOW TO SETTLE IT
                            FAIRLY. SECRETARY NOTED THAT ARABS DO NOT HELP PROBLEM BY SPEAKING WITH
                            SO MANY VOICES. SECRETARY POINTED OUT THAT US HAS ALSO HAD ITS PROBLEM
                            WITH ISRAEL WITH CERTAIN US PROPOSALS TAKING CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES.
                            IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT FINAL SETTLEMENT CANNOT MEET ALL DEMANDS OF BOTH
                            SIDES. HOWEVER, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SETTLEMENT BY
                            GETTING MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY. SECRETARY EMPHASIZED THAT ACTS
                            OF TERRORISM CAN ONLY HARM ARAB CAUSE. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            REPLIED THAT PALESTINIANS ARE FRUSTRATED, DISPERSED, AND DIFFICULT TO
                            SPEAK WITH. LIBYANS KNOW HOW THEY FEEL. UNDER ITALY'S CONTROL 40 PERCENT
                            OF ARAB POPULATION OF LIBYA WAS EXTERMINATED. LIBYANS UNDERSTAND WHY
                            PALESTINIANS FIGHT WITH ALL MEANS THEY HAVE. <pb n="4" xml:id="d93-04"
                                facs="d93-04"/>SECRETARY ASKED WHETHER <gloss target="#t_GOL1"
                                >GOL</gloss> BELIEVES THAT TERRORISM WILL ACHIEVE ARAB GOALS. KIKHIA
                            REPLIED THAT TERRORISM COULD SERVE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO ARAB CAUSE.
                            SECRETARY COUNTERED AGAIN THAT TERRORISM CAN ONLY HARM THEIR CAUSE.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID THAT US CAN PLAY USEFUL ROLE BY
                            NOT CONTINUING ITS EXAGGERATED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. US PROVIDES ISRAEL
                            WITH MAJOR MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE BUT REFUSES TO DELIVER SMALL
                            NUMBER OF F-5's TO LIBYA. ARAB WORLD HAS SEEN CLEARLY THAT US GIVES TOP
                            PRIORITY TO ISRAEL. ONE NEED LOOK ONLY AT WHAT US HAS DONE IN LEBANON
                            AND JORDAN TO PROVE THIS POINT. SECRETARY SAID <gloss target="#t_FM1"
                                >FM</gloss> IS ONLY ARAB THAT HAS EXPRESSED THOSE SENTIMENTS TO HIM.
                            KIKHIA SUGGESTED THAT OTHERS ARE PERHAPS MORE DIPLOMATIC. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> REMARKED THAT LIBYA WAS ONE OF
                            FEW ARAB COUNTRIES TO REJECT SC <gloss target="#t_SCRES1">RES</gloss>
                            242. SECRETARY SAID THAT IN HIS TRAVELS TO OTHER ARAB STATES, IN ALL HIS
                            CONVERSATIONS WITH ARAB LEADERS AND COMMON PEOPLE, THESE SENTIMENTS HAVE
                            NOT BEEN EXPRESSED. HE SAID THAT LIBYA DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ARAB WORLD.
                            SECRETARY SUGGESTED LIBYA TAKE MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH, CALM ITS HARSH
                            STATEMENTS AND DROP ITS SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. SECRETARY SAID BEST HOPE
                            FOR MID-EAST SETTLEMENT PROBABLY LIES IN INDIRECT DISCUSSIONS. KIKHIA
                            ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DISCUSSIONS. SECRETARY SAID THAT
                            RE-OPENING OF CANAL SHOULD BE FIRST PRIORITY, FOLLOWED BY MOVEMENT OF
                            EGYPTIANS TO SOME POINT ACROSS CANAL. NEXT STEP COULD BE TO ADOPT SC
                                <gloss target="#t_SCRES1">RES</gloss> 242 AND SEEK WORK OUT SOLUTION
                            FOR PALESTINE PEOPLE. KIKHIA ASKED HOW PROBLEMS OF PALESTINIANS WOULD BE
                            RESOLVED THROUGH SUCH A PROCEDURE. SECRETARY REPLIED THAT AMBASSADOR
                            JARRING COULD PURSUE MATTER AFTER <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SCRES1">RES</gloss> 242 WAS ADOPTED. SECRETARY
                            CONCLUDED CONVERSATION BY ASKING THAT HIS BEST REGARDS BE CONVEYED TO

                            NEED FOR ARMS (ESCALATED TO PHANTOMS); HIS AVERSION TOWARDS COMMUNISM,
                            BUT CONVERSELY HIS FEAR THAT GROWING PRESSURES MAY FORCE HIM TO ACCEPT
                            “SOVIET OPTION”; AND ARABS' CONTROL OF OIL IN CONTEXT GROWING US IMPORT
                            REQUIREMENTS. I SENSED HE UNEASY ABOUT MOSCOW-CAIRO RAPPROCHEMENT AND

                            MENTION OF PET PROJECT, UNION WITH EGYPT. HIS FRUSTRATION OVER US ME
                            POLICY LED HIM TQ ASK IF JEWISH-CHRISTIAN PACT AGAINST ISLAM EXISTS. HE

                            POWERS (THIS WAS SAME THEME HE HAD PURSUED PREVIOUS DAY AT
                            INTELLECTUALS' SEMINAR IN TRIPOLI—SEE 271657z OCT 72). LAR'S NONALIGNED
                            COURSE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN ENMITY FOR EMMITY'S SAKE AGAINST EITHER
                            U.S. OR OTHER POWERS. LAR HAD LOOKED TO U.S. FOR ASSISTANCE, AND,
                            INDEED, HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING U.S. PUPPET BY OTHER STATES, BUT LAR
                            HAS GAINED LITTLE THEREBY. LAR, LIKE <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >NASSER</persName>'S EGYPT HAD TURNED IN VAIN TO U.S. FOR ARMS “FOR

                            STANCE COULD DRIVE LAR, LIKE EGYPT BEFORE IT, TO TURN TO SOVIETS, LIBYA
                            NEEDS ARMS AND WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THEM FROM THE US: “WE TOO WANT
                            PHANTOMS”. I NOTED THAT EGYPT AND LIBYA HAVE OBTAINED SUBSTANTIAL <pb

                            OTHER SOURCES, INCLUDING <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AND
                            FRANCE, AND ASKED HIM WHY <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> WANTED
                            FURTHER SUPPLIES FROM US. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>
                            REPLIED THAT “MY COUNTRY FEELS THREATENED” AND THAT WEAPONS WOULD ONLY
                            BE USED DEFENSIVELY. ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT EXPLICIT, CLEAR IMPLICATION WAS
                            ONE OF CONCERN ABOUT AN ISRAELI ATTACK. I REMINDED QADFAFI THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAS NOT MADE NEGATIVE DECISION RE LAR'S
                            ARMS REQUESTS. FOREBEARING TO INQUIRE ABOUT HOW HE DEFINED “HIS
                            COUNTRY”, I REMARKED THAT I APPRECIATED <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >QADHAFI</persName>'S CANDOR AND THAT I WISHED TO RECIPROCATE IN
                            SAME SPIRIT. I PICKED UP HIS EARLIER ASSERTION THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAD FAILED TO FULFILL CONTRACTS BY
                            WHICH HE “MUST HAVE MEANT ADDITIONAL F-5'S”. I REMINDED HIM <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAD NOT REFUSED TO SELL THE AIRCRAFT.
                            RATHER, NO DECISION HAD BEEN MADE. THIS WAS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS,
                            INCLUDING <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>'S FAILURE TO RESPOND TO
                            FORMAL US INQUIRIES REGARDING MOVEMENT OF <gloss target="#t_LARAF1"
                                >LARAF</gloss>'S F-5'S TO PAKISTAN. THIS MOVEMENT HAD RAISED
                            QUESTION OF WHETHER <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> WOULD ADHERE
                            TO SALES CONTRACT STIPULATIONS REGARDING USE AND DISPOSITION US-SUPPLIED
                            ARMS. <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>
                            <pb n="5" xml:id="d94-05" facs="d94-05"/>OBJECTED THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAD “REFUSED” — I INTERRUPTED TO
                            CORRECT THIS TO “HAD NOT DECIDED” — TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT “TWO
                            YEARS AGO”, LONG BEFORE INDO-PAKISTANI WAR. DURING THAT WAR, HE ADDED,
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> HAD ESTABLISHED “BRIDGE OF
                            PLANES” TO PROVIDE WAR MATERIAL TO INDIA WHILE US, DESPITE TREATY TIES,
                            FAILED TO SUCCOR PAKISTAN. I REPLIED THAT TO THE EXTENT WE THOUGHT
                            PAKISTAN WAS RIGHT, THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAD PROVIDED
                            STRONG MORAL SUPPOPT TO PAKISTANIS, A FACT TO WHICH PRESIDENT BHUTTO
                            COULD ATTEST. BUT, I SAID, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>
                            WAS IN EFFECT NOT SPEAKING TO THE POINT: THE FACT WAS THAT LAR HAD SENT
                            PLANES OFF, HAD FAILED TO CONSULT WITH <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> AS AGREEMENTS REQUIRED, AND HAD FAILED TO RESPOND TO
                            OUR SUBSEQUENT INQUIRIES. THE ISSUE WAS NOT PAKISTAN. IF CIRCUMSTANCES
                            AROSE IN WHICH HE SIMILARLY SENT PLANES TO THE <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH HIS DECISION INSOFAR
                            AS HIS LEGAL UNDERTAKINGS WITH THE US ARE CONCERNED. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> OBSERVED THAT “IN ANY EVENT”
                            PLANES ARE NOW BACK IN LIBYA AND THEN, RATHER QUICKLY AND LIGHTLY, HE
                            DISMISSED THE SUBJECT BY SUGGESTING THAT LARAF TRAINEES IN PAKISTAN HAD
                            NEED OF F-5 AIRCRAFT.</p>
                        <p>5. I SAID THAT I WOULD, OF COURSE, REPORT TO WASHINGTON HIS INTEREST IN
                            FURTHER ARMS ACQUISITIONS FROM THE US. AT THE SAME TIME, I WISHED AGAIN
                            TO BE FRANK. THE PAKISTANI ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM WAS ONLY ONE ELEMENT.
                            THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT ARMS SUPPLY IS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE SUBJECT THAT
                            CAN ONLY BE DEALT WITH WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP
                            BETWEEN COUNTRIES. WE HAD TO FACE THE FACT THAT THE PRESENT RELATIONSHIP
                            IS DEFICIENT - CERTAINLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE EXTENSIVE MILITARY
                            COOPERATION A PROMISING FIELD UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES. EVEN WITH
                            STRONG ASSURANCES REGARDING DEFENSIVE USE, THEREFORE, I WOULD NOT WISH
                            TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO BELIEVE ADVANCED WEAPONRY COULD REALLY BE
                            FORTHCOMING.</p>
                        <p>6. I WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER TOGETHER WHAT IS WRONG
                            WITH OUR OVERALL RELATIONSHIP AND SUGGESTED FOR OPENERS THAT WE WHAT
                            LACK IS A <pb n="6" xml:id="d94-06" facs="d94-06"/>CONTINUING DIALOGUE.
                            OUR CONTACTS TEND TO BE INTERMITTENT MOST OF THE TIME. WHEN DIALOGUE HAS
                            BEEN IN PROGRESS, MAJOR PROBLEMS—E.G. EVACUATION, TERMINATION OF
                            AGREEMENTS, SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS, RELATIONS WITH OIL COMPANIES,
                            ETC.—HAVE BEEN SMOOTHLY RESOLVED. WHAT WE NEED IS FAR BETTER
                            UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHERS POINTS OF VIEW. FOR EXAMPLE, I POINTED OUT,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> HAD SEVERAL TIMES
                            EARLIER REFERRED TO THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'S “TOTAL
                            COMMITMENT” TO ISRAEL. THE US HAS NO SUCH COMMITMENT. THE US, I SAID, IS
                            “TOTALLY COMMITTED” ONLY TO ITS OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS. SO FAR AS ME IS
                            CONCERNED US STRONGLY SUPPORTS INDEPENDENCE OF <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> MEMBER ISRAEL, BUT IT EQUALLY SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE
                            AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ARAB NEIGHBORS, A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO
                            ARAB-ISRAELI DISPUTE, AND JUSTICE FOR PALESTINIANS, ALL WITHIN THE
                            PARAMETERS OF <gloss target="#t_UNSC1">UNSC</gloss> RESOLUTION 242.
                            PERHAPS, I SUGGESTED, THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> IS ALSO AT
                            FAULT IN MISUNDERSTANDING LIBYAN POINTS OF VIEW. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HEAR
                            LIBYA SAYING THAT IT IS “TOTALLY OPPOSED” TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE
                            MIDDLE EASTERN PROBLEM. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS IS TRUE. BUT, THIS IS
                            WHAT I HEARD MAJOR JALLUD SAYING ONLY THE OTHER DAY. PEPHAPS IF WE SPENT
                            MORE TIME IN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WE WOULD DISCOVER THAT FACILE
                            GENERALIZATIONS ARE INCORRECT AND THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT AREAS OF
                            COMMON INTEREST AND OVERLAP. I THEREFORE URGED ON COL. <persName

                            EXPECT TO CONDUCT DIALOGUE “ABOUT MY LIFE?” REPEATING HIS EARLIER AVOWAL

                        <p>8. AFTER FIRMLY REJECTING ANY SUGGESTION OF ISLAMOPHOBIA, I SAID <gloss

                            OURSELVES AT ODDS WITH THAT COUNTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, I POINTED OUT OUR

                            INTERESTS OF PEACE. WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN GIVING ISRAEL A CLEAR
                            COMPETIVIVE ADVANTAGE. THIS SOMETIMES GIVES RISE TO STRONG DIFFERENCES
                            OF OPINION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ISRAEL OVER LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE AND
                            THERE HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT INSTANCES IN WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO REFUSE OR
                            DEFER ISRAELI REQUESTS. AT THIS POINT, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"

                                corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

                            MOSCOW. HE UNDERSTANDS SADAT'S DILEWMA BUT HAS NOT YET, AT LEAST, BEEN
                            ABLE TO ACCEPT EGYPT'S—MUCH LESS LIBYA'S—RESORT TO “SOVIET OPTION”. HIS
                            FAILURE TO MENTION, EVEN IN PASSING, HIS PET PROJECT - MERGER WITH EGYPT
                            -REINFORCES MY BELIEF IN THIS REGARD. INTERESTING TOO WAS FACT THAT HE
                            DID NOT MENTION, AS JALLUD HAD IN OUR SESSION EARLIER, POSSIBILITY THAT
                            ME PROBLEM MIGHT BE SHELVED OR PUT ON ICE FOR FUTURE TO RESOLVE; I WOULD
                            JUDGE THAT <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> IS NOT ENAMORED
                            OF THIS IDEA. FINALLY, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName>'S
                            SUGGESTION THAT “JEWISH-CHRISTIAN” PLOT AFOOT WAS MORE THAN HALF SERIOUS
                            AND WAS CLUE TO DEPTH OF HIS MUSLIM SENSITIVITIES. IN SUM, CONVERSATION
                            WAS YET ANOTHER REMINDER (AS IF WE NEEDED ONE!) THAT PIVOTAL FIGURE OF
                            LIBYAN REVOLUTION IS AN OBSESSED MAN, A CURIOUS MIX OF 7TH CENTURY
                            ISLAMI, BEDOUIN WARRIOR AND MODERN IDEALISTIC NATIONALIST. HIS
                            JUDGEMENTS ARE SIMPLISTICALLY SHARP: HE PERSISTS IN SEEING EVERYTHING AS
                            EITHER COMPLETELY RIGHT OR COMPLETELY WRONG. UNFORTUNATELY HE PERCEIVES
                            THE U.S. AS WRONG. BUT WE CAN PERHAPS DERIVE SOME CONSOLATION - AND EVEN
                            PROTECTION - FROM FACT THAT VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ELSE FALLS IN SAME
                            CATEGORY AND EVEN <persName corresp="#p_QW1">QADHAFI</persName> IS
                            SUFFICIENTLY PRAGMATIC TO KNOW HE CANNOT TOTALLY ALIENATE EVERYBODY.

                            COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, AND OUR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE. MEASURES MIGHT

                        </list>
                        <p>I share your concern with the FBI report which indicates the Libyan
                            Ambassador is connected with potential terrorist activities in the US.
                            We believe <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> was initially
                            reluctant to support terrorism outside the Middle East, believing that
                            Arabs should concentrate on guerilla activities aimed directly against
                            Israel and the occupied territories. However, as you point out, there is
                            growing evidence <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> is
                            willing to support terrorism outside the Middle East which, in his view,
                            may have become a necessary if temporary expedient. As Embassy Tripoli
                            has pointed out in a recent airgram (A-176 of 23 November, attached)
                                <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName>'s approach towards
                            terrorism in general has not been unambiguous.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, I am afraid there is nothing we can say now directly to
                            the Libyan Ambassador about proper diplomatic conduct which would not
                            possibly risk compromising the FBI report. We may, however, have
                            occasion to talk with the Libyan Ambassador in the near future on
                            another subject. If so, we may be able to make some general remarks
                            deploring terrorism which is so often directed against innocent third
                            parties.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: The Tripoli daily newspaper, al-Faji al-Jadid, on November 14,
                            1972 featured a news report heavily larded with editorial content
                            regarding terrorism. The substance of the reportage is that the <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss>, while it must defend and justify
                            terrorist operations mounted by Palestinians and their sympathizers,
                            sees little benefit to the Arab Cause accruing as a result of those
                            operations and would strongly prefer that Fedayeen operations be
                            confined to Israel and the surrounding Arab countries. Al-Fajr may be
                            regarded, in our view, as an authoritative mouthpiece for the <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> regime. Lamentable, the paper
                            gave no indication that the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> is
                            prepared to use its moral and financial influence with the Fedayeen to
                            reflect its reservations about “unlimited terrorism.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Al-Fajr Report</p>
                        <p>Under the headline, “Secret Decisions of the American Government against
                            Arabs Residing in the United States,” Tripoli's daily al-Fajr al-Jadid
                            November 14, 1972 reported that the “huge wave of anti-Arab propaganda
                            now sweeping Europe and the United States is directed in general against
                            the Arab States and in particular against LAR.” Al-Fajr said that the
                            release of their “comrade commandos” from “enemy prisons” by the
                            Lufthansa hijackers and the fact that all the commandos sought asylum in
                            LAR sparked this propaganda and the “violent, anti-Arab measures by
                            governmental and semi-official authorities in Europe and the United
                            States” directed against Arab students and <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03"
                                facs="d96-03"/>laborers.</p>
                        <p>Al-Fajr reproduced part of an article published recently by the
                            Washington Star and headlined, “Secret Memo of the State Department
                            Restricts Arab Visits to the United States.” The Star reported that
                            secret <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decisions “against the Arabs”
                            were implemented beginning October 19. Al-Fajr also referred to the
                            resolve of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> to “protect every Zionist in the United States,
                            liquidate, all elements supporting the Arab Cause, confiscate all Arab
                            publications concerning the Arab Cause and silence every voice
                            supporting that Cause, particularly among Arab students in American
                            Universities.” The US aims at making Arabs in America feel that everyone
                            moving and speaking in favor of that Cause is subject to surveillance by
                            American Intelligence, and at subduing and humiliating the national
                            feelings of Arab students while bolstering Zionists feelings of pride
                            that they enjoy American support of their State, the paper said.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Al-Fajr charged, at the University of North Carolina “Arab
                            students—including eight Libyans—were subject to ridiculous questions
                            such as, 'Why does Libya help the Commando Organizations? What do you
                            know about these Organizations? Do you know any Palestinian student
                            here? Do you promise not to talk about the Palestinian Problem? Do you
                            have any circulars or pictures or statements regarding the Palestinian
                            Cause?'”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> LAR Position?</p>
                        <p>Al-Fajr in commenting on the above, asserted that the United States and
                            Britain were “motivated by Zionist Intelligence to take advantage of
                            what they call 'Terrorism', in order to justify the committing of more
                            acts of aggression. “It is strange that they forgot that the Zionists
                            were the first people to use terrorism through their terrorist bands of
                            Irgun, Stern, and Hagana.” The paper asked, “What benefits accrue to the
                            Arabs as a result of these acts of terrorism? Are the Arabs getting any
                            benefits?” “Of course not. In fact, the Arabs are the only ones harmed
                            by these terrorist operations.”</p>
                        <p>“In fact” Al-Fajr concludes the Arab States, particularly the LAR, bear

                            whose home has been usurped by Terrorism; their struggle to restore
                            their homeland cannot be described as 'acts of terrorism'. Based on that
                            conviction, the LAR received the Munich commandos.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Al-Fajr's editorializing reveals the quandry the LAR is facing
                            on the issue of terrorism. On the one hand, <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> disapproves of terrorist operations in foreign
                            countries outside the “proper field of battlet"—Israel and the
                            surrounding Arab countries: <persName corresp="#p_QW1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> believes that the fighting against Israel should
                            be carried out by unified commando organizations on the basis of “the
                            nationalization of Commando activities”. He sees acts of terrorism
                            against Zionists in foreign countries as harmful to the Palestinian
                            Cause because they provoke hostility against the Arabs and tend to
                            increase disunity among the several Commando organizations. Moreover,
                            the behavior of the LAR's top leadership towards terrorists over the
                            last several months tends to confirm <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss>
                            displeasure with their operations. Tripoli's media made quite a point of
                            the fact that the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> did not itself
                            ask for the return of the corpses of the commandoes killed in Munich.
                            Rather, private Libyan citizens reportedly initiated and financed the
                            arrangements for the funeral in Tripoli and no <gloss target="#t_RCC1"
                                >RCC</gloss> member took part in the attendant ceremonies. Also, it
                            was noteworthy that during the time the Lufthansa hijackers were in
                            Tripoli, including the occasion of their press conference, no <gloss
                                target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> members were on hand. Indeed, there was
                            no public mention of any contacts between them or members of the <gloss

                        <p>On the other hand, foreigners' suggestions that the <gloss

                            such terrorists—described locally as “Commando heroes"—excites the scorn
                            of <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> spokesmen, e.g. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KKM1">KIKHYA</persName>'s statement at
                            Damascus (reported by Beirut press November 2) to the effect that the
                                <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> regards any request for
                            extradition or trial of commandoes as “absurd and unreasonable…anyone
                            believing that such is possible is silly”. Similarly, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> himself, most recently <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d96-05" facs="d96-05"/>in his October 7 speech at Tripoli,
                            went out of his way to praise the Japanese perpetrators of the Lod
                            Airport massacre for having displayed the “true Fedayeen spirit”; he
                            also claimed that the <gloss target="#t_LARG1">LARG</gloss> is backing
                            morally and financially “all the Fedayeen” (Tripoli 1615).</p>
                        <p>As is his wont, <persName corresp="#p_QW1">Qadhafi</persName> would like
                            to have his cake and eat it too; he ipso facto abets Fedayeen terrorist
                            activities with Libyan funds and defends their operations anywhere, even
                            though he would prefer that a unified commando movement, in tandem with
                            a progressive Arab bloc, confine its operations to occupied Palestine,
                            including Israel. Unfortunately there is no indication in the Al-Fajr

                        <p>I. SUMMARY<lb/>Soviet drive into Western Mediterranean and defection of
                            France from NATO underline importance of strategic US presence and
                            facilities in Morocco and their integral role in Western defense system.
                            Excellent relations with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> have kept
                            US presence intact, but Soviet influence has grown rapidly. In face of
                            massive influx of Soviet arms and technicians into Algeria as part of
                            Soviet policy of cut-rate arms sales to create exploitable areas of
                            tension, national security and economic development are Morocco's prime
                            concerns. US and Western economic and military aid have not been fully
                            responsive to these concerns. At same time, Arab-Israel confrontation
                            generates pressures on King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to adopt more neutral posture and to align
                            Morocco with Arab extremists. In this connection, concern that Middle
                            East tensions could provoke major conflagration has created nascent
                            receptivity in Morocco to Yugoslav, Spanish and French proposals for
                            neutralization of Mediterranean through withdrawal of US and Soviet
                            fleets. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is prepared to help King
                            economically and, in difficult years ahead, to exploit threats to
                            Moroccan stability to detriment of US. In these circumstances, US also
                            may face return to grant military assistance or prospect of
                            concessionary Soviet military aid to Morocco. Clear mark of Soviet
                            interest in Morocco is <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Podgorny</persName>
                            visit scheduled in March 1969. Strategic importance and economic
                            potential of Morocco warrant special effort to blunt Soviet drive.
                            Higher levels of US-inspired multilateral and bilateral economic aid
                            supplemented by grant military assistance would go far toward giving <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d97-02" facs="d97-02"/>King greater sense of security
                            within context of improving economy. Morocco is Western-oriented and
                            King would prefer association with West. Like most leaders, however, he
                            feels bound to act according to his view of Morocco's vital
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>II. CURRENT ASSESSMENT</p>
                        <p>A. Strategic Importance of Morocco</p>
                        <p>Primary importance of Morocco is its strategic location commanding
                            entrance to Mediterranean. US presence in Morocco helps assure against
                            harassment of Sixth Fleet use of Straits of Gibraltar and lines of
                            supply and communications to southern NATO and CENTO countries. Morocco
                            also provides site for vital military communications and <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> relay station. Thus, continued US
                            presence in Morocco is integral part of Western defense system. French
                            defection from NATO, Soviet naval buildup in Western Mediterranean and
                            growing Soviet military and economic presence in Algeria further enhance
                            strategic importance of Morocco to US.</p>
                        <p>B. Gains and Losses</p>
                        <p>1. In absolute terms, US achieved most of its 1968 policy objectives in
                            Morocco. Excellent relations with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            safeguarded US presence in Morocco which helps protect southern flank of
                            NATO and assisted in assuring free access to Mediterranean for US
                            military forces. Important US military communications facilities needed
                            for effective air and sea operations in Atlantic and Mediterranean and
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> transmitter to Eastern Europe
                            continued to operate in Morocco without impediment. Morocco played
                            constructive, moderating role in Arab and African councils, e.g. a)
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> supported Jarring Mission and
                            advocated peaceful solution to Arab-Israel confrontation, despite
                            growing pressures from Palestine resistance movement, and b) <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> called for end to arms race with
                            Algeria, and end to civil strife in Nigeria. <gloss target="#t_GOM1"
                                >GOM</gloss> made progress toward resolving major differences with
                            Algeria, Spain and France. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> took initiative to improve relations with Algeria
                            by downplaying sensitive arms and border issues and agreed to
                            cooperative regional economic effort to build greater Maghreb. High
                            level bilateral contacts with Spain resulted in “retrocession” of Ifni
                            to Morocco. Resumption of limited French economic assistance helped set
                            stage for eventual normalization of Moroccan-French diplomatic
                            relations. Internal stability contributed to assuring progress on King's
                            economic development effort.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d97-03" facs="d97-03"/>
                        <p>2. In relative terms, however, US position in Morocco deteriorated. While
                            US presence remained intact, Soviet influence grew rapidly. Following
                            opening of Soviet Consulate General in Casablanca in 1967, significant
                            mile-stones included a) Soviet agreement to build Jerada thermal
                            electric power plant, b) signature of five year Soviet trade agreement,
                            and c) first Soviet naval visit. Other illustrations of success of
                            communist efforts to expand influence in Morocco were a) Bulgarian

                            legal cousin of proscribed Moroccan Communist Party, and d) steady flow
                            of visitors to and from Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. At

                            reportedly is that Morocco should assume more non-aligned posture.
                            Soviet support of Arab cause in Arab-Israel confrontation and failure of
                            West to meet sufficiently Moroccan needs for foreign economic and
                            military assistance and for new markets have been major factors in
                            success of rapid Soviet military build-up in Mediterranean and communist
                            economic penetration of Morocco.</p>
                        <p>C. Analysis of Policies and Conditioning Factors</p>
                        <p>1. Measure of US success or failure in achieving its objectives in
                            Morocco depends on degree to which US policies contribute to Morocco's
                            security and economic development, both prime concerns of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. While King appreciates US
                            power, values long association with US, and believes US global aims of
                            peace through firm opposition to communist subversion and aggression are
                            in Mococco's long-term best interest, he prizes tangible assets above
                            all. Substantial US economic assistance has been of major importance to
                            Morocco and has helped to counteract Moroccan concern about US supply of
                            arms to Israel, and frustration at what Moroccans consider preferential
                            US treatment of Israel in Arab-Israel confrontation. US inability
                            despite February 1967 presidential commitment to deliver arms requested
                            by King early in 1966 until 1969 and later, however, cast doubt upon US
                            willingness to help ease concerns of King about security. At same time,
                            US and Western European economic assistance have not met Morocco's trade
                            and economic development needs and <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            assistance remains uncertain. Similarly, with little prospect of
                            adequate Western military help, Morocco continues to face massive arms
                            imbalance with Algeria whose growing military capability is assured by
                            presence of Soviet technicians.</p>
                        <p>2. King and <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> are aware that Western
                            Mediterranean, including Morocco, has become major target of Soviet
                            influence. Much as he recognizes threat, he considers that Soviet
                            presence in Mediterranean is big power problem, <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d97-04" facs="d97-04"/>beyond Morocco's capabilities to
                            handle. While wary of Soviet intentions in Morocco, King is confident he
                            knows his people and can handle dangers inherent in dealings with <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Ties with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and communist countries appear to him to offer certain
                            political, economic and military advantages, e.g.</p>
                        <p>a) badly needed additional capital for economic development,<lb/>b) added
                            outlets for Moroccan citrus and phosphates,<lb/>c) greater access to
                            East European arms supplies,<lb/>d) counterpoise to arms imbalance with
                            Algeria and deterrent to possible hostile actions of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>,<lb/>e) tangible answer to internal
                            critics who oppose close association with US because of its support for
                            Israel, and<lb/>f) improved Moroccan position with non-aligned third
                            world countries.</p>
                        <p>In brief, Morocco is Western-oriented and King would prefer association
                            with West. Like most leaders, however, he feels bound to act according
                            to his view of Morocco's vital interests.</p>
                        <p>3. Achievement of US objectives in Morocco depends on understanding
                            nature of Soviet drive into Western Mediterranean, as well as Moroccan
                            reaction to it. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seeks to expand
                            its influence through exploitation of three causes of instability in
                            Middle East and North Africa, namely a) Arab-Israel dispute, b) struggle
                            for dominance between traditional and socialist Arab regimes, and c)
                            economic underdevelopment of Arab World. Soviet policies endeavor to a)
                            polarize area along Soviet-Arab vs US-Israel lines, b) strengthen
                            pro-Soviet Arab socialist regimes by massive military and economic
                            support, and c) weaken Western ties with traditional Arab regimes
                            through attractive economic aid offers and prepare ground for change of
                            leadership at opportune later date.</p>
                        <p>4. Economic and military aid to key Arab countries, such as Morocco, are
                            required to defend US and Western interests in area. Soviet selection of
                            Algeria as strategic bridgehead into North Africa, similar to UAR in
                            Near East and Somalia in East Africa, vitally affects security of
                            Morocco, and political climate arising from Arab-Israel confrontation
                            facilitates Soviet economic and military drive. Moreover, concern that
                            Middle East tensions could provoke major conflagration has made certain
                            elements in Morocco receptive to Yugoslav, French and Spanish proposals
                            for neutralization of Mediterranean through withdrawal of US and Soviet
                            fleets.</p>

                        <p>III. FUTURE PROJECTION</p>
                        <p>A. US world power, and its successes and failures elsewhere, will
                            condition US influence in Morocco somewhat, but determining factor will
                            be extent to which US can help Morocco in its quest for security and
                            economic development. Fact that twenty-year Moroccan-Algerian treaty of
                            January 15, 1969, forswears resort to force to settle differences may
                            have eased somewhat King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            concern over massive inventory of Soviet arms in Algeria and growing
                            military capabilities of Soviet trained Algerian forces. While
                            apparently prepared to await fulfillment of Algerian declarations of
                            intent to cooperate economically, he and other senior <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> officials are under no illusion that
                            treaty assures Moroccan security. Inherent hostility of socialist regime
                            in Algeria to Moroccan monarchy has impelled King to maintain adequate
                            deterrent force which will involve acquisition of additional military
                            equipment, particularly transport and fighter aircraft. Current JSOP
                            Force Guidelines project major Moroccan military materiel requirements
                            that will total nearly $57 million by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1974. Credit sale of this equipment would impose mounting debt burden
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> will find increasingly
                            difficult to carry given demands on foreign exchange reserves imposed by
                            accelerating tempo of economic development program. In these
                            circumstances, <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> will find it
                            increasingly difficult to refuse attractive Soviet aid offers, and US
                            may face choice between return to grant military assistance and prospect
                            of concessionary military aid to Morocco from Soviet Union or its
                            satellites. Since growing Algerian military capabilities are measure of
                            potential threat to security of Morocco, long term projection of
                            Moroccan military requirements indicates need for an increase in
                            military assistance for foreseeable future. Should Moroccan-Algerian
                            relations again sour, <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> military force
                            no doubt would, increase substantially.</p>
                        <p>B. While Five Year Economic Development Plan is a soundly conceived and
                            necessary program, time frame is too short to resolve long-term problems
                            of assuring adequate local food production, employment and education for
                            burgeoning population of Morocco. In next three to five years,
                            therefore, Morocco may require more rather than less foreign economic
                            assistance, and economic and military aid may become more important of
                            US and Western interests. Prospect is that to extent US and West are
                            unable to meet Moroccan economic needs through bilateral and
                            multilateral arrangements, opportunities for Soviet Union and communist
                            satellite states to increase their influence will grow. Next foreseeable
                            step is visit of Podgorny in March 1969 and logical sequel is further
                            offer of Soviet economic aid, perhaps to be financed through Nazi-type
                            clearing agreement favored by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            satellites and attractive to <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d97-06" facs="d97-06"/>
                        <p>C. Concomitant of foreseeable economic and social problems is increased
                            danger to stability of Morocco. In event that economic development
                            effort and social progress should fall seriously short of popular
                            aspirations, influence of forces for political change with accompanying
                            insecurity and instability (e.g. Istiqlal, UMT and UNFP) would increase
                            sharply, as would ability of local communists, abetted by Soviet Union,
                            to exploit deteriorating situation. Students and urban unemployed are
                            predictable sources of unrest <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> is
                            aware of this prospect and efforts are underway to accelerate social and
                            economic progress and educational reform. Meanwhile GOM is prepared to
                            contain dissatisfaction of political opposition, students and labor by
                            force if necessary. Tradition of monarchy is deeply ingrained, and
                            loyalty of rural population, military and security forces, and civil
                            government establishment, as well as elements of opposition, make it
                            unlikely that forces for political change could create nationwide
                            disturbance in immediate future.</p>
                        <p>D. Since <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would profit at expense of
                            US in case of disturbances, Soviet incitement and covert support of
                            discontented elements in such circumstances appears certain. Resulting
                            unrest would provide environment ideal of Soviet-inspired and supported
                            propaganda and subversion against US presence in Morocco. Given
                            pro-Israel image of US in Arab World, King would find it difficult to
                            defend close association with US against internal and external
                            criticism. Pressure to dismantle existing US communications facilities
                            and remove US military presence would follow. In these circumstances,
                            unless US efforts to resolve Arab-Israel dispute change US image in Arab
                            World, regional political climate that facilitated into Soviet drive
                            Mediterranean and North Africa also would facilitate intensified Soviet
                            effort to get US out of Morocco.</p>

                        <p>IV RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>Foregoing future projection stresses dangers to vital US interests in
                            Morocco, but, we believe, accurately portrays forces at work inside and
                            outside Morocco and direction of their thrust. US faces difficult period
                            ahead when conjunction of Moroccan domestic economic problems, expanding
                            Soviet influence, uncertain relations with Algeria, and Arab-Israel
                            problem could seriously damage US position in Morocco. Judicious and
                            adequate response to Moroccan concerns about security and economic
                            development, however, would enable US to take maximum advantage of
                            existing assets such as pro-Western orientation of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and his people and King's
                            determination to carry out far-reaching economic development program.
                            Moreover, Morocco, unlike many African and Middle Eastern countries, has
                            human and material resources necessary for successful transition from
                            underdevelopment to economic viability in modern world. Strategic
                            importance of Morocco, its economic potential and manageable size and
                            nature of its development problems argue that US consider Morocco
                            intensive aid target. Higher levels of US-inspired multilateral and
                            bilateral economic aid supplemented by small, but continuing grant
                            military assistance program would go far toward counteracting effect of
                            predictable anti-US forces in immediate future and safeguarding
                            long-term US position in Morocco by assuring eventual success of
                            Moroccan economic development effort. Specifically, Embassy
                            recommends:</p>

                        <p>1. BRIGADIER GENERAL MOHAMED MEDBOUH, DIRECTOR OF ROYAL MILITARY
                            HOUSEHOLD, CALLED ON ME AT HIS REQUEST MAY 27 FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE
                            A TOUR D'HORIZON. ALONG WITH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"

                            LIKELY REFLECT THOSE OF KING WHO MAY INDEED BE PRESUMED TO HAVE GIVEN
                            HIM GUIDANCE FOR HIS DISCUSSION WITH ME ON FOLLOWING SUBJECTS:</p>
                        <p>A) WHEN I RAISED MATTER OF MOROCCAN RELATIONS WITH <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName> STRESSED THAT APPARENTLY IMPROVED RELATIONS OF
                            MOROCCO WITH SOVIET UNION SHOULD IN NO WAY BE INTERPRETED TO AFFECT
                            WESTERN ORIENTATION OF MOROCCO. I REPLIED THAT WHILE INFORMED US
                            OFFICIALS UNDERSTOOD THAT MOROCCAN-SOVIET RAPPROCHEMENT WAS NOT AT
                            EXPENSE OF INCREASINGLY CLOSE MOROCCAN-US RELATIONS, MANY AMERICANS WERE
                            PERPLEXED AND WONDERED ABOUT ITS ULTIMATE EFFECT ON MUTUAL CONFIDENCE
                            AND ESTEEM THAT CHARACTERIZE RELATIONS RETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. I
                            LISTED IMPRESSIVE SERIES OF ACHIEVEMENTS OF <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> IN ITS DRIVE TO ESTABLISH POSITION OF STRENGTH IN
                            MOROCCO, E.G. 1) OPENING OF CONSULATE GENERAL IN CASABLANCA, 2)
                            ESTABLISHMENT OF CULTURAL CENTER IN RABAT, 3) SOVIET NAVAL VISIT <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d98-02" facs="d98-02"/>TO CASABLANCA, 4) <persName
                                corresp="#p_PN1">PODGORNY</persName> VISIT TO MOROCCO, 5)
                            INAUGURATION OF RABAT-HAVANA AEROFLOT FLIGHTS, AND LASTLY 6) PROSPECTIVE
                            VISIT OF GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_DR1">DRISS</persName> TO <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. I NOTED THAT COMING ON HEELS OF
                            PODGORNY VISIT TO MOROCCO DESPATCH OF MOROCCAN MILITARY MISSION TO
                            MOSCOW WOULD CREATE ERRONEOUS, BUT UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION THAT MOROCCO
                            HAD LITTLE REGARD FOR SENSITIVITIES OF US AND AMERICAN PUBLIC.</p>
                        <p>B) ELABORATING ON AEROFLOT-HAVANA FLIGHTS I POINTED OUT THAT MOST LATIN
                            AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAD CONDEMNED CUBAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES AND THAT
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> WAS AWARE OF EARLIER CUBAN
                            ATTEMPTS AT SUBVERSION IN MOROCCO AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA. I SPECULATED
                            ON HOW MOROCCO WITH ITS DEDICATION TO MODERATION COULD HAVE FALLEN INTO
                            THIS SOVIET TRAP. <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1">MEDBOUH</persName>
                            FULLY AGREED AND EVEN NOTED EARLIER INSTANCE OF ATTEMPTED CUBAN
                            SUBVERSION AGAINST MOROCCO DURING ALGERIAN CONFLICT.</p>
                        <p>C) REFERRING TO RECENT SUDANESE COUP I RECALLED THAT EXTREMIST ELEMENTS
                            IN SUDAN HAD MADE STARTLING PROGRESS FROM RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT
                            BEGINNINGS. THEIR HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ACTION IN SOWING CONFUSION AT TIME OF
                            GENERAL ABBOUD's FALL APPARETLY STILL PAYING OFF AS COMPOSITION OF NEW
                            PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO INDICATE. I STRESSED IN DETAIL GREAT
                            SOVIET EXPERTISE IN EXPLOITING NUMERICALLY SMALL COMMUNIST BASE.</p>
                        <p>D) ON US MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO MOROCCO, <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName> TOLD ME KING WAS PLEASED WITH AID FOR <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 AND SINCERELY HOPED PROGRAM OF
                            CONTINUING AID COULD BE ENVISAGED. HE STRESSED THAT AIR DEFENSE WAS TOP
                            PRIORITY. I REPLIED US FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARD HELPING MOROCCO
                            MILITARILY, AND IMPRESSED WITH <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITIES. BUT YEARLY PROGRAM WOULD DEPEND UPON
                            CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIOINS. <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName> CONTINUED THAT WHILE GOV WAS PURSUING POLICY OF
                            DETENTE WITH ALGERIA, MOROCCO HAD TO LOOK TO FUTURE WHEN AN ALGERIA
                            FULLY ARMED AND TRAINED BY <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> MIGHT
                            CHANGE ITS MIND AND REVERSE ITS FIELD. ACCORDING TO <persName
                                corresp="#p_Medbouh1">MEDBOUH</persName>, PROBLEM OF MEETING MINIMUM
                            MOROCCAN DEFENSE AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS WAS CRTICIAL. I SAID I
                            APPRECIATED THIS AND NOTED US VIEWED MOROCCAN EFFORTS TOWARD MAGHREB
                            DETENTE APPROVINGLY, PARTICULARLY SINCE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DIVERT
                            ALGERIAN ENERGIES FROM SOVIET ASSISTED MILITARY BUILD-UP FAR IN EXCESS
                            OF ITS DEFENSE NEEDS TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FURTHER MOROCCAN OR
                            MAGHREB ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WOULD ALSO BE ENCOURAGED AS A RESULT. <pb

                            AGREEMENT WITH MY POSITION ON AEROFLOT AND SAID HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND

                        <p>After a brief private meeting with the President, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> made a formal presentation of his
                            message from King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            stressing that the King's interest was in preserving the spiritual and
                            moral bond with the U.S. He expressed the King's sincere and profound
                            friendship. The King, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName>, regards President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> as the spiritual son of President EISENHOWER for
                            whom the King had such a high regard. President EISENHOWER was
                            outstanding in faithfulness which he showed to friends of the U.S. whom
                            he supported without reservations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> said that the present
                            political situation in North Africa was a source of great concern to the
                            King of Morocco. He cited recent developments in Libya and in Tunisia.
                            The Moroccan reaction was to see the progress of extremism and
                            subversion across North Africa. The King wondered to what extent the
                            leader of the free world would follow passively these developments. The
                            King asked the question before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName> left “Where does the U.S. plan to establish its
                            last defense against subversion?”</p>
                        <p>Morocco, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName>, has set
                            its path and is on its way to the difficult goal of bringing a good life
                            to its people. It is also seeking to make its contribution to peace in
                            the Middle East as well as in the Mediterranean area. The King brought
                            together the <pb n="2" xml:id="d99-02" facs="d99-02"/>leaders of the
                            Moslem world in a constructive fashion at the Islamic Conference.
                            Morocco can in the future play a significant role.</p>
                        <p>The King wished by his mission to show that his only concern was a
                            constructive relationship with the United States and the internal
                            strength of Morocco. Military strength was not a problem. The primary
                            problem was economic.</p>
                        <p>At a level to be decided by the President, the King hoped that a new
                            basis for cooperation “outside normal paperwork” could be established.
                            This would involve new procedures and a new policy.</p>
                        <p>In reply the President said he would welcome concrete suggestions from
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> as to what procedures
                            needed changing. The U.S. considers Morocco a strong anchor in the
                            Mediterranean and wants to keep it that way.</p>
                        <p>(In a subsequent conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, Minister <persName corresp="#p_TM1"
                                >Tahiri</persName> was more specific about what the King had in
                            mind. He said the King wished to lay this groundwork for a possible
                            visit in the future at which time he and the President could map out the
                            level of cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Tahiri</persName> that the
                            Department would consider the approach made to the President and would
                            send further comments to the Moroccan Government.)</p>

                                have tended to look at the North African situation on a pragmatic
                                country and crisis basis. I think the time has come now, however,
                                for a systematic review of the entire situation. I will be sending

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName>, who is in Rome
                            en route to his new post in Athens, has been asked by King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s most intimate confidant, to
                            transmit a personal message from the King to you. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName>, you will recall, served last in
                            Morocco and was warmly regarded by King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> wants you to know that
                            he is deeply concerned with the dangers to the Maghreb states stemming
                            from the new radical military regime in Libya. He feels that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s subversive capabilities have
                            been greatly improved by access to Libyan financial resources. According
                            to the King, the young and inexperienced leader of the Libyan military
                            regime is only a “straw man” for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> who has inserted Egyptian troops into Libya to
                            protect against the possibility of a “counter revolution.” King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> fears that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s next step will be to eliminate
                            President Boumedienne of Algeria in favor of someone more willing to
                            accept his leadership in the Arab world. The elimination of Boumedienne,
                            according to the King, would greatly increase the subversive potential
                            of both Nasser and the Soviets in Tunisia and Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The King would like the U.S. to use whatever appropriate influence is
                            available to prevent <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s and
                            Soviet plans in the Maghreb countries from succeeding. He feels that
                            unless we take a positive interest in this matter, there is a real
                            danger that the entire littoral of the southern Mediterranean, from the
                            UAR to Morocco, is likely to fall to Communist domination.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has been

                            contributed further to his agitation, even though there is no immediate
                            organized threat to his throne. The lining up of Morocco, Tunisia and
                            Algeria against <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s demands
                            at the recent Arab summit—and Hassan's moderating influence there—have
                            probably also contributed to his fear that Morocco may be close to the
                            top of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s list for

                                corresp="#p_LA1">LARAKI</persName>, SECRETARY SAID PRESIDENT
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName> HAD GREAT PERSONAL
                            INTEREST IN MOROCCO AND HIGH REGARD FOR IT. <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> LOOKED TO MOROCCO AS PIVOT IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD.
                            HE HOPED THE FONMIN WOULD SPEAK FRANKLY TO HIM, SINCE HE WANTED TO BE
                            ABLE TO REPORT REALISTICALLY TO PRESIDENT IN ORDER THAT US POLICY IN
                            AFRICA BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>3. SPANISH SAHARA - PRIME MINISTER SAID KING <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >HASSAN</persName> SOUGHT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS.
                            HE HAD THEREFORE MUTED CERTAIN CLAIMS, HOWEVER JUST THEY MIGHT HAVE
                            BEEN. THE ONLY OUTSTANDING POINT STILL IN LITIGATION WAS SPANISH SAHARA.
                            AS EVERYONE KNEW, THIS TERRITORY WAS ARAB IN POPULATION. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> RESOLUTION ADVOCATING SELF-DETERMINATION
                            FOR THE PEOPLE OF SPANISH SAHARA HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY MOROCCO. THIS
                            SHOWED THAT MOROCCO WAS NOT INTERESTED IN EXPANSION OR ANNEXATION.
                            HOWEVER, MOROCCO'S APPROACHES TO SPAIN, INCLUDING KING <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName>'S VISIT TO MADRID IN 1969, HAD
                            NOT BORNE FRUIT. IT WAS THE STRATEGIC, NOT ECONOMIC SIDE OF SPANISH
                            SAHARA WHICH INTERESTED MOROCCO. ISSUE OF SAHARAN PHOSPHATES HAD BEEN
                            BLOWN UP OUT OF ALL PROPORTION. THERE WAS A RESERVE OF ONLY ONE AND A
                            HALF BILLION TONS OF PHOSPHATE IN SPANISH SAHARA, WHEREAS THE MOROCCAN
                            RESERVE WAS 20 BILLION. THE COST OF PRODUCING SAHARAN PHOSPHATES WOULD
                            BE LESS THAN IN THE USA OR MOROCCO. HOWEVER, PHOSPHATE PRODUCTION IN
                            MOROCCO WAS A STATE MONOPOLY. THE STATE COULD MAKE THE NECESSARY
                            SACRIFICES OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD IF IT WISHED TO OVERWHELM
                            SAHARAN PHOSPHATES. POPULATION OF SPANISH SAHARA WAS VERY SMALL AND
                            MIGHT EASILY FALL PREY TO COMMUNIST OR CHINESE INFLUENCE, MAKING
                            POSSIBLE THE REALIZATION OF OLD DREAM OF A COMMUNIST OPENING TO THE
                            ATLANTIC. MOROCCO HAD NOT GIVEN UP HOPE OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH
                            SPAIN. IT WAS SURPRISED, HOWEVER, THAT US, WHICH HAD ALWAYS SUPPORTED
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> RESOLUTION, HAD ABSTAINED THIS
                            YEAR.</p>

                        <p>4. SECRETARY NOTED THAT US WAS INVOLVED IN DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH
                            SPAIN. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> CONFIRMED THIS AND
                            POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS OFTEN NECESSARY, WHEN US HAD FRIENDS ON OPPOSITE
                            SIDES OF A QUESTION, TO ABSTAIN. PEDERSEN OBSERVED THAT THIS DID NOT
                            MEAN ANY CHANGE FROM US POSITION ON SELF-DETERMINATION. PRIME MINISTER
                            SAID MOROCCO ALSO FAVORED SELF-DETERMINATION AND BELIEVED THAT IF THIS
                            WERE CARRIED OUT UNDER <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> AUSPICES,
                            PEOPLE OF SPANISH SAHARA WOULD CHOSE UNION WITH MOROCCO. IN RESPONSE TO
                            QUESTION FROM SECRETARY WHEN THIS PROCESS MIGHT TAKE PLACED <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA1">LARAKI</persName> REPLIED THAT HE DOUBTED IT WOULD
                            BE WHILE FRANCO WAS ALIVE. HOWEVER, MOROCCO WAS WILLING TO ASSIST IN
                            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE AREA, WITH SPAIN AS WELL AS WITH OTHERS.</p>

                        <p>5. ALGERIA - WHEN SECRETARY NOTED THAT US HAD RECENTLY RENEWED RELATIONS
                            WITH MAURITANIA, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PRIMIN</gloss> ADDED THAT HE
                            HOPED US RENEWAL OF RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA WOULD SOON FOLLOW. HE SAID
                            HIS MAJESTY HAD TRIED TO LEAD ALGERIAN REGIME TOWARD MAGHREB COOPERATION
                            RATHER THAN TOWARD MIDDLE EAST AND BEN BELLA HAD DONE. THIS HAD BEEN
                            SUCCESSFUL AND ISLAMIC AND ARAB SUMMITS HAD SHOWN CERTAIN CONCURRENCE OF
                            VIEWS BETWEEN ALGERIAN AND MOROCCAN GOVERNMENTS. SECRETARY NOTED DESIRE
                            OF <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> FOR BETTER
                            RELATIONS WITH US, WITH RESULTANT UPGRADING OF INTEREST SECTIONS IN BOTH
                            COUNTRIES. RELATIONS WERE IMPROVING, AS INDICATED BY LARGE EL PASO
                            CONTRACT. US WOULD BE HAPPY RENEW RELATIONS WHENEVER ALGERIANS WISHED.
                            IT AGREED ALSO THAT MAGHREB UNITY SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED. HE WAS GLAD
                            THEREFORE THAT HIS MAJESTY WAS TAKING LEAD.</p>

                        <p>6. MIDDLE EAST - <persName corresp="#p_LA1">LARAKI</persName> EXPRESSED
                            VIEW THAT PEACE WAS INDIVISIBLE. IF MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d101-05" facs="d101-05"/>WERE NOT RESOLVED, IF GREAT POWERS
                            DID NOT SUCCEED IN IMPOSING PEACE, THERE WAS RISK OF WORLD-WIDE
                            CONFLAGRATION. TO IMPOSE A NEGOTIATED PEACE WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IN
                            VIEW OF HATRED AND DISTRUST BETWEEN ARABS AND ISRAELIS. HE FEARED <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> RESOLUTIONS WOULD SOON BE BYPASSED BY
                            EVENTS. US HAD AT LEAST AS SUBSTANTIAL AN INTEREST IN ARAB COUNTRIES AS
                            IN ISRAEL. MOROCCO WAS CONCERNED OVER INCREASING INFILTRATION OF SOVIETS
                            IN THE AREA, FIRST IN SYRIA, THEN IRAQ, SUDAN, AND LIBYA. THE SCREW WAS
                            BEING TIGHTENED. THE TREND WAS NOT YET IRREVERSIBLE BUT IT SOON WOULD
                            BE. KING <persName corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName> THOUGHT THAT ANY
                            SOLUTION WHICH DID NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE PALESTINIAN PROBLEM WAS
                            DOOMED TO FAILURE. A SOLUTION ACCEPTABLE TO THE PALESTINIANS WHO WERE
                            REALISTIC, AS MOROCCO HAD OBSERVED AT THE ARAB SUMMIT, WOULD BE A JUST
                            SOLUTION. IT WAS ADMITTEDLY DIFFICULT TO ASK SUCH PIONEERS OF ZIONISM AS
                            GOLDA MEIR AND DAYAN TO ACCEPT SUCH A SOLUTION BUT THE NEW GENERATION
                            MIGHT. IN THIS CONNECTION HE CITED A DECLARATION BY MAPAI SECRETARY ELIA
                            (SP?) THAT AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PALESTINIANS WOULD BE BEST FOR ALL
                            CONCERNED.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d101-06" facs="d101-06"/>
                        <p>7. SECRETARY AGREED RESOLUTION OF ME PROBLEM WAS IN US INTEREST. HOWEVER,
                            GREAT POWERS COULD NOT IMPOSE A SOLUTION IF THEY WANTED TO. IF US HAD
                            LEARNED ONE THING, THAT WAS THAT IT COULD NOT IMPOSE ITS WILL AND IT HAD
                            NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO DO SO. IT WOULD DO WHAT IT COULD, HOWEVER, TO
                            ENCOURAGE PARTIES TO RESOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. HE HAD MADE US POSITION
                            CLEAR IN DECEMBER 9 SPEECH, KNOWING IT WOULD NOT SATISFY EVERYONE. US
                            POSITION WAS NEVERTHELESS A BALANCED ONE. JUST AS MOROCCO HAD GIVEN UP
                            CERTAIN CLAIMS IT THOUGHT JUST, US THOUGHT PARTIES TO ME CONFLICT MUST

                            ADMITTED ERROR IN TIMING BUT SAID RESULT WAS ANTICIPATED. HE SAID EVENT

                            TOLD SECY BOUMEDIENE A VERY WISE LEADER AND AWARE THIS POSSIBLE TACTIC.
                            KING SAID IT PAINFUL TO THINK THAT <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"

                        <p>1. Morocco. Although reports often conflicting, three developments have
                            recently disturbed Moroccan scene and led to almost constant state alert
                            among military and police forces. First, [text not declassified]
                            military plot against regime discovered late December or early January
                            and some military officers, all captains or below, summarily executed.
                            Second, according to press and intelligence reports, six or more
                            Moroccan terrorists were apprehended in Spain in January. Their reported
                            objectives were assassination of King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and, according one report, <persName

                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> as well. Third, continued student
                            unrest, including strikes after Id al Kebir holidays, is highly visible.

                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is sending Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> as a special
                            emissary to discuss with you deterioration in the Mid-Eastern situation.
                            This initiative results from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s request that the King intervene personally with
                            you to underscore the seriousness of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s peace appeal to you. Comparable emissaries have
                            already been received by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WH1"
                                >Wilson</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >Pompidou</persName>. There is a strong element in this initiative
                            of <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> trying to preserve his
                            own position in the Arab world as active for the Arab cause.</p>
                        <p>What He Will Say</p>
                        <p>He will probably bring a formal message from the King urging in a general
                            way that you give special attention to the Middle East. If the pattern
                            here follows that in London and Paris, this message will be relatively
                            bland. But it is believed that <persName corresp="#p_LA1"
                                >Laraki</persName> has instructions to press orally the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—that further deterioration will lead to further Soviet and radical
                            gains;<lb/>—that the U.S. not deliver further arms to Israel;<lb/>—that
                            the U.S. press Israel to withdraw from the occupied
                            territories;<lb/>—that the U.S. press Israel to accept a political
                            solution based on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                            resolution.<lb/>—that the U.S. press Israel to accept a role for the

                            <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> is personally
                            Western-oriented, but he is strongly pro-Arab and strident on the
                            Arab-Israeli question.</p>
                        <p>Your Objective</p>
                        <p>There are two reasons for your seeing <persName corresp="#p_LA1"
                                >Laraki</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—to bolster further our relationship with Moroccan leadership and to
                            encourage the notion that the U.S. will be responsive to moderate Arab
                            voices and<lb/>—to use this as a channel to other Arabs to convey the
                            message that the U.S. is genuinely trying to help achieve a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The impression to be conveyed is that we are prepared to do what is
                            necessary to help achieve a political settlement but we cannot do the
                            job alone. Above all, we must be certain in our own minds that there is
                            a will to peace on both sides. What we really need from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is his unequivocal assurance
                            that he is prepared to live and let live with Israel provided Israel
                            withdraws to essentially pre-war borders and gives the Palestinians a
                            fair deal.</p>
                        <p>Talking Points</p>
                        <p>—You appreciate his coming. We are always eager to listen to our Arab
                            friends. You regard King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            as one of our good friends.<lb/>—You are deeply concerned about the
                            situation in the Middle East and especially about the new Soviet
                            role.<lb/>—The U.S. has tried to work with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> for peace and limiting the arms race. But Moscow has
                            not been constructive on either count. This has been especially true on
                            the question of arms supply.<lb/>—We do not support Israel
                            unqualifiedly, but we are committed to its survival. Most of our
                            diplomatic efforts in the past year were made against Israel's wishes.
                            We have subscribed to the principle (in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Resolution) that Israel should not gain territory as a
                            result of the war provided its neighbors commit themselves in concrete
                            ways to accept Israel and live at peace.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d104-03" facs="d104-03"/>
                        <p>—You have always felt strongly about the plight of the Palestinians and
                            the necessity of a fair settlement for them if there is to be peace.</p>
                        <p>—We take President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s May 1
                            speech seriously and will respond as soon as we are ready. What we have
                            most needed from President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            all along has been unequivocal assurance that he is ready to live at
                            peace with Israel and to commit himself to concrete measures for
                            enforcing that peace. We are aware of his recent statements along these
                            lines and would welcome any greater precision that might be
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Bilateral Issues</p>
                        <p>1. The Prime Minister may press for continued U.S. help with Morocco's
                            own air force (19 of 24 contracted F-5 aircraft have been delivered). In
                            general, we are interested in assisting, but the $10 million planned for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 is unavailable until the
                            Foreign Military Sales Act is freed.</p>
                        <p>2. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s visit, originally
                            scheduled for July, has been postponed at the King's request because of
                            the expected arrival of a baby. A date in December was offered, and he
                            suggested early next year. [On the surface, this seems mainly a matter
                            of finding a mutually possible time, although we have one report that
                            suggests that the King may be wary of committing himself before he sees
                            which way the U.S. will move on the Arab-Israeli problem.]</p>

                        <p>1. The Prime Minister said King Hasson thought the recent appeal from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> was a positive
                            element in the Middle East situation. He does not believe that direct
                            negotiations are possible in the present circumstances. Rather, a
                            settlement would have to be reached through indirect or secret
                            negotiation. Morocco is seriously concerned about the decline of US
                            influence in the Mediterranean and the Near East. If no solution is
                            found to the present conflict the whole area will increasingly drift
                            away from Western influence and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> will correspondingly increase its influence. Morocco
                            believes that in view of Israel's air and technical superiority any
                            additional <pb n="3" xml:id="d105-03" facs="d105-03"/>delivery of arms
                            would aggravate the situation seriously. The US must use its influence
                            to bring Israel to accept the overall solution proposed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister advised President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> that if he had any suggestion with respect to
                            working out a solution together he would be glad to convey it to His
                            Majesty. However, if additional arms deliveries are made, then nothing
                            could be worked out.</p>
                        <p>3. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said our
                            position with respect to Israel continues to be one of great restraint.
                            He said the US stood by the principle of Israel's right to exist and
                            that Israel's position in relation to its neighbors should not be
                            weakened. The US is concerned about the introduction of Soviet pilots
                            into the UAR.</p>
                        <p>4. The President said that discussions were being held with Israel, with
                            the Russians, and also at the Four-Power Conferences, to arrive at a
                            just <pb n="4" xml:id="d105-04" facs="d105-04"/>and balanced solution.
                            Our conversations with the Russians have been quite unsuccessful. The
                            President also stated that our policy towards the Middle East is still
                            under review, that there are frequent meetings on the Middle East, and
                            that there would be one next week. It could be that nothing dramatic
                            would come out of the meeting. He appreciated today's thoughtful and
                            constructive conversation.</p>

                            MOVES TO END “STATE OF EXCEPTION”</p>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In a July 9 birthday message to the Moroccan people, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> announced plans to end the
                            “state of exception” by which he has ruled since June 7, 1965. He
                            intends to submit constitutional revisions to a referendum on July 24,
                            then provide for a two-round election, on August 21 and 28, for a
                            unicameral parliament. While he has not yet made public the precise
                            powers of the new legislative body, they will presumably be very limited
                            and clearly subordinate to those of the monarch.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bending to Domestic Pressures?</p>
                        <p>The King's initiative seems to some observers a concession to various
                            domestic political pressures. Many educated Moroccans and the political
                            parties have resented the longevity and blatant absolutism of his
                            emergency rule. Anti-monarchical sentiment has risen since the fall of
                            Libya's Kinq Idris in September 1969. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s regime has been beset from
                            several quarters since late 1969. The discovery of a subversive group
                            prompted the rounding-up of some 400 left wing dissidents throughout the
                            country. Student unrest of unprecedented intensity led to university
                            strikes lasting nearly 11 weeks. Revelations of official corruption
                            embarrassed <pb n="2" xml:id="d106-02" facs="d106-02"/>the government
                            and raised nagging doubts about the accountability of high officials.
                            Irredentist elements, led by the conservative Istiqlal Party, erupted in
                            outrage after <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> recently
                            gave up Morocco's longstanding claims to Algerian-held territory.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">…Or Following a Plan?</p>
                        <p>None of these pressures, however, appears genuinely to have threatened
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s rule or even
                            influenced significantly his decision to restore parliament at this
                            time. He has had constitutional revisions under consideration for
                            several years. Moreover, various indications, starting in early 1969 and
                            multiplying after the October local elections, have suggested the
                            probability of a timetable to lift the “state of exception” sometime in
                            1970. Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            taken extraordinary precautions to ensure the success of his plans and
                            to forestall any organized opposition. He made his announcement with
                            little forewarning and deliberately set early dates for the voting
                            exercises to coincide with the summer vacation season. He has also
                            issued veiled warnings to the electorate that rejection of the
                            referendum would mean continuation of the “state of exception” and to
                            political parties that those who preach boycott would find themselves
                            excluded from the political system.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s careful preparations
                            also extend to the composition of the parliament. He apparently plans to
                            draw at least one-half <pb n="3" xml:id="d106-03" facs="d106-03"/>of the
                            membership from existing—and largely apolitical—elected bodies:
                            provincial assemblies, municipal and communal councils, and professional
                            chambers representing business, labor, and agriculture. He is
                            encouraging his cabinet ministers and other loyal aides to run for the
                            remaining seats. He presumably expects that his efficient Minister of
                            Interior will supervise the elections with the same magisterial aplomb
                            he showed in the local council vote of October 3, 1969 (when he was able
                            to announce complete election results, including statistical analyses of
                            the age group, education level, and political affiliation of the 11,166

                        <p>The short-term objectives of King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> seem assured. Besides gathering great credit with
                            the public for his initiative, he can almost certainly look forward to a
                            massive referendum victory and minimum-risk parliamentary elections. The
                            major opposition parties, while unhappy over the role and makeup of the
                            parliament and apprehensive about electoral rigging, will be under
                            severe pressure to “cooperate” with the palace and to participate.
                            However they decide, Hassan will be able to install a loyalist-dominated
                            legislature in early September and thereby add what could become a
                            genuinely needed safety valve.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s future actions will
                            determine whether he has created a new institutional bulwark for his
                            monarchy or has opened a Pandora's box. He will face a formidable
                            problem in making the new parliament a credible political institution.
                            Over the past nine years he has used the “divide and manipulate”
                            technique to hold power. He has factionalized the political elite,
                            including his most fervent supporters, to the point of immobilism. Just
                            as he divided the loyal majority in the 1963-65 parliament, he could do
                            the same with the loyal majority in the new body. Indeed, unless
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> decides to change his
                            tactics and to promote the development of a cohesive working majority,
                            perhaps under the aegis of a new political party or under another form
                            of leadership authority vested outside his person, he will risk
                            immobilism in the new assembly and eventually another breakdown in
                            parliament-palace relations. The representative character and power of
                            the legislature also appear crucial. If the deputies lack genuine
                            grassroots support and have no real power, they could seem to to the
                            Moroccan public like a band of self-serving sycophants. This lack of
                            confidence could be of critical importance, for even today Moroccans
                            under 30 years old, and comprising around two-thirds of the total
                            populace, tend to have little respect for either regime or parties.</p>

                        <p rend="center">MOROCCO: KENITRA AND THE KING</p>
                        <p>Since the evacuation of Wheelus airbase in June 1970, the sole American
                            military facilities remaining in the Arab world are in Morocco: the US
                            Navy Training Command at Kenitra and sensitive communications
                            installactions at nearby Bouknadel and Sidi Yahia. A king's word rather
                            than any written treaty guarantees their existence. In 1963, when the US
                            evacuated the military bases it had occupied in Morocco, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> orally assured President
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> that these facilities could remain
                            indefinitely; he repeated this oral assurance to President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> in 1967. Both sentimental and political
                            reasons appear to lie behind the King's commitment. This, however, may
                            increasingly be eroded by anti-US pressures and by his own excessive
                            efforts to utilize the existence of the bases as a lever for obtaining
                            greater US aid and support.</p>
                        <p>Royal Sentiment. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            personal feelings towards the US cannot be accurately measured. We do
                            know, however, that they go back to a memorable boyhood experience: his
                            presence at the 1943 meeting at Casablanca between his father, Mohammed
                            V and President <persName corresp="#p_RABJ1">Roosevelt</persName>. Since
                            then, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has placed
                            considerable value on friendship with the US, probably reflecting a
                            continuing sense of <pb n="2" xml:id="d107-02" facs="d107-02"/>personal
                            gratitude to the first major Western power that expressed favorable
                            interest in Moroccan independence. In addition, the king probably
                            retains favorable memories of his contacts with American personnel at
                            Kenitra while he was Crown Prince in the late 1950's: he, his brother,
                            and sisters got to know Americans there and learned to rely on US
                            facilities for luxury goods and on base officials for various personal
                            and political services.</p>
                        <p>A Convenient Option. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            also developed important political reasons to cultivate the US. His
                            “American option” has become a means to many ends. On different
                            occasions he has been able to use the US as counterweight in various
                            dealings: with his domestic opposition, hostile neighbors (notably
                            Algeria), ex-colonial power France, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. His trip to Washington in 1963, for example, enabled
                            him to draw an implied US stamp of approval for the controversial
                            constitutional system he installed at that time. Similarly, he played up
                            Moroccan-US ties during the four-year period, 1965-69, when the French
                            withdrew their ambassador and suspended economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>From the outset <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> apparently
                            recognized that his US option, to be credible, required a continuing and
                            visible US interest in close relations with Morocco. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> probably appreciated the element
                            of disinterest in US diplomatic friendship for Morocco—in contrast to
                            the French whose designs he considered neo-colonialist—he also seemed to
                            have <pb n="3" xml:id="d107-03" facs="d107-03"/>realized it could well
                            lead to declining US attentiveness. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> therefore looked to the US military for support
                            and sought White House attention, skillfully trying to establish a
                            personal relationship with each new president.</p>
                        <p>To place his US insurance policy on a more secure basis, he assured
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> in 1963 that the Kenitra
                            facilities could remain. Three years later, he attempted to carry his
                            “special relationship” with the US a step farther. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s domestic problems in 1966 were
                            formidable; drought had caused a severe shortfall in farm production,
                            and the political parties were chafing under a state of emergency rule
                            imposed the previous year. Moreover, Morocco was at odds with its North
                            African neighbors as well as Spain and France, and the king was under
                            military pressure to counter the Algerian threat with an arms buildup.
                            In a deftly orchestrated campaign (including a visit to Moscow and
                            bilateral talks with the US at diplomatic, military, [text not
                            declassified]), <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> laid the
                            groundwork for his proposition in January 1967, that Morocco and the US
                            conclude a formal mutual security arrangement. His proposal met with
                            rebuff by US officials, but <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> nevertheless reassured President
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>, during a visit to Washington in
                            February 1967, that the US could continue using the Kenitra
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>Advantages to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> Outweigh
                            Drawbacks. The arrangements on Kenitra have provided <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> with considerable leverage to
                            help ensure a continuing flow of US military aid and economic
                            assistance. It has enabled <pb n="4" xml:id="d107-04" facs="d107-04"
                            />him to prevent a gradual phase-down in US aid levels that had been
                            planned as a consequence of the 1963 evacuation. Instead he was able to
                            count on substantial US support in later years. Overall, through fiscal
                            year 1969, Morocco has received, since 1953, about $66.2 million under
                            the military assistance program and an additional $692.4 million in US
                            economic aid ($56.2 and $292.5 million, respectively, since <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963).</p>
                        <p>Over the past seven years, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            has thus parlayed the US stake in Kenitra into concrete political and
                            economic advantages for his regime. These benefits give <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, if anything, a greater stake
                            than Washington in a continued US military presence. Moreover, he has
                            thus far succeeded in neutralizing the political drawbacks in the
                            arrangements. Foreign criticism from radical Arab quarters, notably
                            Algeria during the June 1967 war, has not deterred him from maintaining
                            this apparent anachronism in the Arab world—nor has it barred him from
                            active participation in Arab councils and diplomatic campaigns. At home
                            he has been able to sidestep the potentially embarrassing question of
                            whether the US military facilities constitute an infringement of
                            Moroccan sovereignty. By placing Moroccan flags over the three
                            installations, Moroccan military insignia on the uniforms of US
                            personnel, and a sizeable Moroccan military presence at the Kenitra
                            base, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has been able to
                            marshal supporting evidence for his claim that the three bases are
                            legally—and genuinely—Moroccan. (Moroccan military and civilian
                            officials and, to a considerable extent, educated Moroccans in general,
                            are aware of the continuing US <pb n="5" xml:id="d107-05" facs="d107-05"
                            />military presence at these installations—although not the details of
                            their activities). Indeed, at a press conference in July <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> baldly asserted that even Soviet
                            party leader Brezhnev had acknowledged the bases to be Moroccan. His
                            credibility appears to remain intact even though the Moroccan opposition
                            press, echoing news despatches on the Symington sub-committee hearings,
                            has recently begun for the first time to question the US military
                            presence. His defense of the status quo serves to tie his past verbal
                            assurances even closer to his power and prestige.</p>
                        <p>Facilitics May Be Caught Between <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s Enemies and His Own Expectations.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this royal support, the US military facilities in Morocco
                            face an uncertain future and may be increasingly subject to royal
                            pressure. The Moroccan monarch appears in a paradoxical situation. On
                            the one hand, his present determination to preserve the US presence
                            leaves him increasingly vulnerable to the tides of popular opinion.
                            Another rapid rise in Middle East tensions could compromise the US
                            facilities, and a renewed outbreak of Arab/Israeli hostilities almost
                            certainly would do so. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s uncompromising stance toward his domestic
                            opposition is likely to drive the political opposition, desperately
                            searching for ways to embarrass and harass the regime, to intensify its
                            attacks on the US presence. Moreover, organized labor is likely to join
                            the attack since the authorities on October 1 ordered the Moroccan
                            workers (over 750) employed at US facilities on the three installations
                            to disaffiliate from the country's largest trade union.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d107-06" facs="d107-06"/>
                        <p>On the other hand, the growing number of dissatisfactions Morocco finds
                            in its bilateral relations with the US, including the prospects of
                            declining American economic and military assistance, will probably cause
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> once again to attempt
                            to use the bases as leverage against the US. That the regime has thus
                            far permitted the opposition press to publish articles critical of
                            Kenitra—while Morocco seizes newspaper issues and arrests journalists
                            for articles on numerous other subjects—suggests that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> may already have opened such a
                            campaign. If the American response is unsatisfactory to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, he may well put additional
                            pressure on the US by increasing Moroccan controls over the bases.</p>

                        <p>1. I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER WHO SUMMONED ME
                            TO DISCUSS US FACILITIES AT KENITRA. HE ASKED ME POINT BLANK WHETHER
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> CONSIDERED US FACILITIES AT
                            KENITRA TO BE BASE OR NOT. HE ADDED THAT JUDGING FROM PRESS REPORTS OF
                            SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON KENITRA, SENATORS CLEARLY CONSIDERED US
                            FACILITIES AT KENITRA TO BE BASE. REPORTED ATTITUDE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH,
                            PRIMIN MAINTAINED, WAS NOT CLEAR, AND IN HIS VIEW EXECUTIVE BRANCH
                            TESTIMONY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH FIRMER.</p>
                        <p>2. HE NOTED THAT IN AFTERMATH PUBLICATION OF HEARINGS THERE HAD BEEN NO
                            OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF STATE NOR FROM EMBASSY RABAT, AND
                            MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH STATEMENT IN MAP (RABAT 4826), HAD BEEN
                            ONLY OFFICIAL VOICE TO DENY THERE US BASE IN MOROCCO.</p>
                        <p>3. PRIMIN WENT ON TO SAY THAT FROM EVERY MOROCCAN EMBASSY IN ARAB WORLD
                            THERE HAD BEEN REPORTS OF LOCAL PRESS ALLEGATIONS OF US BASE IN MOROCCO
                            AND DEROGATORY ALLUSION TO CONNECTIONS BETWEEN KENITRA. FACILITIES AND
                            OPERATIONS OF SIXTH FLEET DETRIMENTAL TO ARAB CAUSE. ALL THESE BASED ON
                            PRESS REPORTS OF SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT.</p>

                        <p>4. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, PRIMIN SAID, DOUBTS HAD ARISEN IN MINDS OF
                            MANY MOROCCANS AS TO NATURE OF US PRESENCE AT KENITRA. IT WAS IMPORTANT
                            TO HIM TO LEARN EXACTLY HOW <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> REGARDED
                            THESE FACILITIES IF WE REGARDED THEM AS BASE, THERE WERE ESTABLISHED
                            TYPES OF AGREEMENTS WHICH GOVERNED EXISTENCE OF BASES. IF WE DID NOT
                            REGARD FACILITIES AS BASE, WE SHOULD CONSIDER POSSIBLE WAYS OF
                            ATTENUATING NEGATIVE EFFECT OF RECENT PUBLICITY. HE DESIRED AN EXPLICIT
                            OFFICIAL (PRIVATE) STATEMENT FROM DEPARTMENT.</p>
                        <p>5. I SAID I WOULD ASK FOR ONE, BUT COULD TELL HIM THAT WE DID NOT
                            CONSIDER KENITRA TO BE A US BASE. US WAS USING FACILITIES AT A MOROCCAN
                            INSTALLATION THROUGH COURTESY OF <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>.
                            THIS HAD BEEN MADE CLEAR BY EXECUTIVE BRANCH TESTIMONY DURING
                            CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. STATE DEPARTMENT HAD RECENTLY BEEN PREPARED TO
                            DECLARE THIS PUBLICLY, BUT AS FAR AS I KNEW HAD NOT HAD OPPORTUNITY
                            SINCE NO JOURNALIST HAD POSED QUESTION. I DESCRIBED DIFFERENCE OF VIEW
                            BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVER NATURE OF ARRANGEMENTS
                            ABROAD TO BE SUBMITTED TO SENATE: I EXPRESSED OPINION THAT EVEN IF
                            PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD PUBLICLY DENIED EXISTENCE OF US BASE AT KENITRA,
                            VIEWS OF SENATORS TAKING OPPOSITE POSITION WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN GIVEN
                            WIDE PUBLICITY AND HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY UNFRIENDLY REGIMES IN MIDDLE
                            EAST. I ASKED WHETHER PRIMIN FELT EXPLICIT PUBLIC DECLARATION NOW BY
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WOULD BE HELPFUL, ADDING THAT IT
                            WAS MY IMPRESSION THAT WITH REGARD TO STATEMENT BY EMBASSY RABAT, MR.
                            ZENINED OF MINISTRY OF INFORMATION HAD AGREED WITH US THAT IT WOULD BE
                            PREFERABLE FOR EMBASSY SAY NOTHING SINCE STORIES RE KENITRA WERE
                            EMANATING FROM WASHINGTON. <persName corresp="#p_LA1">LARAKI</persName>
                            REPLIED THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO RECTIFY SITUATION THROUGH
                            PUBLIC STATEMENT AT THIS TIME.</p>
                        <p>6. PRIMIN REFUSED TO BE DRAWN OUT WITH REGARD TO WHAT ATTENUATING STEPS
                            MIGHT BE TAKEN SHOULD DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE BE THAT KENITRA FACILITIES
                            ARE NOT US BASE. HE CONTINUED TO STRESS THE AWKWARD POSITION WHICH
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> HAD BEEN PUT INTO BY RECENT
                            PUBLICITY, WHICH HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE HARMFUL THAN PRESS
                            STORIES IN JULY OWING TO FACT THAT IT BASED ON PUBLIC OFFICIAL REPORT OF
                            SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE. HE SPECIFICALLY ALLUDED TO ONE SENATOR'S REPORTED
                            STATEMENT THAT US MIGHT SEND IN SOLDIERS IF SAFETY OF AMERICANS AT
                            KENITRA WERE ENDANGERED.</p>

                        <p>7. AT NO TIME DID <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PRIMIN</gloss> BRING KING'S

                        <p>8. COMMENT: I FOUND THIS INTERVIEW DISCONCERTING OWING TO PRIMIN'S
                            REFUSAL TO BE FRANK WITH REGARD TO WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND. I AM CONFIDENT
                            HE KNOWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING OUR PRESENCE AT KENITRA. IT IS
                            UNFORTUNATE THAT OPPORTUNITY APPARENTLY DID NOT ARISE FOR DEPARTMENT TO
                            ISSUE OFFICIAL DENIAL RE EXISTENCE OF AMERICAN BASE IN MOROCCO AS GOM
                            EVIDENTLY FEELING VERY EXPOSED AT PRESENT.</p>
                        <p>9. I SUGGEST FOLLOWING ACTIONS:</p>
                        <p>A. DEPARTMENT TO SEND ME STATEMENT FOR COMMUNICATION TO PRIMIN ALONG
                            LINES THAT PROPOSED FOR PUBLIC USE IN STATE 179653.</p>
                        <p>B. AT SAME TIME DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZE ME TO CONVEY TO <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA1">LARAKI</persName> EXCERPTS FROM CONFIDENTIAL

                                >NEWSOM</persName> TO SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE LAST JULY. I WOULD SUGGEST

                            ALL OF PAGE 4 EXCEPT THE SENTENCE ABOUT INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS, AND PAGE
                            5 DOWN TO LAST SENTENCE FIRST PARAGRAPH. IN ADDITION I WOULD INCLUDE
                            FIRST PARAGRAPH PAGE 6 AND SECOND PARAGRAPH PAGE 6 DOWN TO LAST
                            SENTENCE.</p>
                        <p>C. ALTHOUGH PRIMIN SAID PUBLIC STATEMENT BY DEPARTMENT NOW TOO LATE TO BE
                            USEFUL, I BELIEVE THAT ONE MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND SUGGEST THAT DEPARTMENT
                            URGENTLY CREATE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE STATEMENT ALONG LINES PARAGRAPH 3
                            STATE 179653.</p>

                        <p>You may have seen the telegram at Tab B reporting the King of Morocco's
                            desire to discuss the status of the U.S. communications facility at
                            Kenitra (Morocco) with a Presidential emissary.</p>
                        <p>As you know, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has a
                            distressing penchant for emissaries, but <pb n="2" xml:id="d109-02"
                                facs="d109-02"/>in this case he has more reason than usual. The
                            presence of our communications facilities—naval [text not
                            declassified]—is based only on an oral understanding between him and
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> in 1963. When our SAC bases there
                            were closed, these facilities stayed on under the Moroccan flag and
                            training activities for Moroccans are conducted there.</p>
                        <p>As a result of news stories coming out of the Symington Subcommittee,
                            this has again blown up as a public issue in Morocco. The King's
                            opposition has charged the King with allowing a U.S. “base” on Moroccan
                            soil. Disturbed by this, the King has asked for an emissary (a) to
                            review the implications of the continued existence of these bases and
                            (b) to assure him that they are indeed Communications facilities and not
                            operational bases.</p>
                        <p>The logical course of action would be:</p>
                        <p>—to complete our own review (underway) of the need for these
                            facilities;<lb/>—to discuss our conclusions with the Moroccan technical
                            level;<lb/>—to ratify new arrangements at the top.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> proposed this
                            procedure, but the King still feels he would like to see an
                            emissary.</p>
                        <p>In this case, I would be inclined to go along since there is one possible
                            emissary who would make a lot of sense. Robert Murphy not only has a
                            longstanding association with the King [text not declassified] One of
                            the issues here will be what price the U.S. will be prepared to pay
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in military assistance
                            (from a depleted African budget) in return for continuation at
                            Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>The telegram at Tab A, therefore, says we are prepared to send an
                            emissary in two or three weeks, as soon as the latest round of publicity
                            on the issue has died down.</p>
                        <p>While I would normally try to turn this off, I think we might as well
                            respond promptly and get this issue settled. Otherwise, this problem
                            will still be hanging around to confront the President when <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> makes his official visit in
                            March (assuming the President approves the proposed visit list).</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You will recall that Robert Murphy scurried off to Morocco in
                            mid-December to discuss the future of the Kenitra communications
                            facilities with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>, who was
                            present at the meeting, sent in a report based on both is own and Mr.
                            Murphy's observations which was sent to you at the time. What it all
                            boiled down to was the fact that the King wanted more U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>To wind up his responsibilities, Mr. Murphy has sent Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> a fuller account of the meeting
                            with a copy of the letter designated for you [attached]. Murphy's report
                            is basically in harmony with <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                                >Rockwell</persName>'s:</p>
                        <p>—Murphy shares with <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> the
                            impression that the King is simply trying to exploit the situation to
                            derive substantial material benefits from the U.S. He was told that
                            “nominal and picayune items will no longer do.” However, Murphy also
                            stressed that the atmosphere was entirely friendly and he does not
                            believe the King intends to eject or threaten to eject the facilities.
                            [As <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> had noted, the King
                            indicated that he had no complexes about bases; he simply wanted to know
                            “what President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> wanted” in
                            connection with them.]</p>
                        <p>—Murphy also concluded that the King has decided that this is a good time
                            to bargain and that the negotiations ought to be kept at the Chief of
                            State level.</p>
                        <p>—-The King agreed that the Russians have been active in stimulating
                            domestic opposition to the U.S. facilities, doubtless because of the
                            ramifications they may have for the Soviet Mediterranean fleet. He
                            indicated that he had been quite courageous in his talks with Brezhnev
                            in Moscow. In that connection, <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                                >Rockwell</persName> recalled the King's annoyance over the yearly
                            negotiations for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 wheat and other
                            aid which were not felt to be commensurate with the difficulties
                            occasioned by the U.S. military presence in Morocco; in the King's
                            words, “if, however, the counterpart were sufficient, then I could look
                            Brezhnev in the face.”</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d110-02" facs="d110-02"/>
                        <p>—Murphy was hopeful the King would be more specific as to his wants — he
                            went only so far as to say he would send an emissary to Washington and,
                            of course, discuss the matter with the President himself —- and the King
                            was equally disappointed that Murphy had nothing substantial to say on
                            the matter of “counterpart.”</p>
                        <p>—Murphy also came away with the impression that the hasty American
                            departure from Wheelus came as somewhat of a surprise to the
                            Moroccans.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing you need to do about this at the moment. Here is what is
                            in train:</p>
                        <p>1. I have told State to get this settled before King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> comes on his visit in March. We
                            probably cannot prevent his raising the subject with the President
                            because he remembers bargaining personally with President
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> for more aid in return for allowing us
                            to stay at Kenitra when our SAC bases closed in 1963. Nevertheless, I
                            have told State I did not think President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> would want to get into that and thought he would
                            prefer this issue to be settled.</p>
                        <p>The military [text not declassified] have just finished their study of
                            how badly they want to retain these facilities. Their study will be the
                            subject of IG study very shortly. At that point, I shall discuss with
                            you what the options look like and how you might wish to involve
                            yourself.</p>

                        <p>1. We have examined King's request conveyed to Robert Murphy, in latter's
                            capacity as special envoy of President December 1970, that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> extend additional benefits to Morocco
                            in order to assist King and His Government in convincing Moroccan people
                            of continued desirability US presence at Kenitra. Request has been
                            reviewed in light of Kenitra's continued usefulness to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, US resource availability, and
                            traditional US friendship for Morocco demonstrated by our long-term
                            interest in Morocco's security and economic development. Impending
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> visit to US has lent
                            certain note of urgency to this examination, but as you are aware, basic
                            political, military and economic aspects of <pb n="2" xml:id="d111-02"
                                facs="d111-02"/>problem were already under review at time of
                            Murphy's and your audience with King in December.</p>
                        <p>2. Conclusion has been reached that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            should seek retain access to Kenitra complex as long as possible view
                            special advantages afforded by use of Moroccan frequencies, which its
                            retention entails, if political, both domestic and foreign, as well as
                            economic costs do not become insurmountable. We recognize, however, that
                            Moroccan political climate over near to mid-term future may pose
                            problems for continued US military presence at Kenitra, however
                            disguised or described to Moroccan public. We are also agreed that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has long-term interest in
                            Moroccan internal political stability and does not wish to do anything
                            which might threaten present regime as it attempts to adjust to
                            incipient internal political forces which have already begun to manifest
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> also recognizes that our presence
                            does not rest on any contractual legal basis and may be terminated <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d111-03" facs="d111-03"/>by King or <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> at any time. Hopefully, any required
                            withdrawal would be delayed until such time as orderly arrangements had
                            been developed elsewhere. In its own long-term interest, <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> prefers avoid confrontation disruptive
                            to our total relationship with Moroccan regime on this issue.</p>
                        <p>4. In light foregoing, which is for your background only, you are
                            requested to seek audience with King indicating that you wish to deliver
                            on behalf of President latter's reply to King's observations regarding
                            Kenitra which were conveyed to you and to Robert Murphy last year. You
                            should note that the President appreciates this opportunity to
                            communicate with the King on a matter of mutual interest which, he would
                            hope, King would agree may now be set aside so that other matters of
                            common concern may be reviewed during King's state visit in April.</p>
                        <p>5. In your reply to King you should make following points:</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d111-04" facs="d111-04"/>
                        <p>(A) Fact that His Majesty has continued to make possible US access to
                            Kenitra has been very much appreciated by <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> as evidence King's own appreciation of importance to
                            Morocco of effective US presence in area in which Soviet presence has
                            significantly increased.</p>
                        <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, however, in past had never tied
                            its assistance programs to Morocco to continued US access to Kenitra.
                            Our economic aid program, amounting to $660 million through 1969, has
                            been based on our estimate not only of Moroccan economic requirements
                            but also on Moroccan ability to benefit from <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> economic aid. Size of that program, as well as its
                            composition, has also had to reflect availability of US economic
                            assistance worldwide at any given time. Despite pressure on US economic
                            assistance resources, owing to changed attitudes of American public,
                            Congressional opinion, and unforeseen demands arising out of US
                            commitments in <pb n="5" xml:id="d111-05" facs="d111-05"/>Southeast
                            Asia, Morocco had continued to be major beneficiary of US economic
                            assistance programs. In Fiscal Year 1970 alone, they amount to
                            approximately $26.6 million, and will be substantially greater during
                            Fiscal Year 1971.</p>
                        <p>(c) Similarly, US military assistance program for Morocco had also been
                            maintained at significant level despite downward pressures on military
                            assistance budget and compelling requirements arising out of Southeast
                            Asian problem. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has always developed
                            its programs for Morocco in terms of total relationship of Morocco to US
                            as a friendly country which we wished to see endowed with a credible
                            defense deterrent. Fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
                            access to Kenitra was not repeat not a determining factor at any time
                            affecting either the size or composition of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> programs for Morocco. Indeed, <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> has a continuing interest in Morocco's security and
                            development. In future, as in past, size of program will reflect
                            assessment by both governments <pb n="6" xml:id="d111-06" facs="d111-06"
                            />of Moroccan priority requirements in military area and total resources
                            available US and other donors to meet those requirements.</p>
                        <p>(d) President wishes King to know that subject to Congressional
                            appropriations we will continue to assist Morocco in future because of
                            our continued interest in Moroccan legitimate security and development
                            needs.</p>
                        <p>(e) As regards Kenitra, if at any time His Majesty were to conclude that
                            our presence at Kenitra posed unacceptable political liabilities we
                            would understand and we would be prepared to discuss with His Government
                            altering the US presence at Kenitra as appropaiate. In meantime, we hope
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> will find way of conveying full
                            extent of substantial <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> economic and
                            military assistance to Moroccan public in order that major benefits
                            US-Moroccan relationship has brought to Morocco may be more widely
                            understood. <pb n="7" xml:id="d111-07" facs="d111-07"/>Morocco is the
                            largest African recipient of US economic and military assistance, over
                            $726 million from 1946 to 1969.</p>
                        <p>6. At this point the King may identify what specific additional
                            assistance projects he has in mind. If so, you should make clear
                            financial restrictions which preclude additions to ongoing programs
                            while indicating our willingness to reexamine possible adjustments of
                            programs in light <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> priorities. As
                            appropriate and if you deem it advantageous, you should be prepared to
                            review with him our total <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71
                            assistance programs (including <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            assistance resources made available during <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 71) and indicating that we would hope that our economic
                            assistance would continue to be generally of same order of magnitude in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72, qualified as subject to
                            availability funds from Congress. Such review would make it necessary
                            for you to refer to the proposed <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit and grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for training, as
                            well as Navy's proposed improvements to Kenitra (paras (a) and (b)
                            below). In deciding whether to use this info, you should weigh the <pb
                                n="8" xml:id="d111-08" facs="d111-08"/>advantages which may be
                            derived by withholding info until King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s visit to Washington. We have in mind that
                            notwithstanding our hope Kenitra discussions will be concluded before
                            King's arrival US and therefore not raised with President, we cannot be
                            certain this will be the case. Consequently, if subject were raised by
                            King with President, there may be advantages in not having conveyed this
                            info in advance.</p>
                        <p>(a) We are planning on $15 million <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 and the same amount for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 72. The $15 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 will require Presidential
                            Determination to waive Congressional ceiling, but this message
                            constitutes White House authorization use of that figure in discussions
                            with the King. We leave to your discretion whether it necessary clarify
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> credit for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 is zero as a result of Congressional

                            for US personnel. These projects, totaling approximately $14 million,
                            are subject to availability of excess dirhams. $8 million already
                            approved for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 and 71 and Navy

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>When the U.S. closed down its three Strategic Air Command bases in
                            Morocco in 1963, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            reached an oral agreement with President <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                            during a state visit in the spring of that year which permitted the U.S.
                            to stay on at its naval [text not declassified] communications
                            facilities at Kenitra. The base was transferred to Moroccan control, and
                            the US Navy established a communications training school for the
                            Moroccan military there. Also, the training program for the F-5 aircraft
                            which we sold to Morocco was located at that installation. In that same
                            talk with President <persName>Kennedy</persName>, certain levels of
                            economic and military assistance for the next couple of years were also
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The operation continued smoothly until last summer when there were leaks
                            from the Symington sub-committee's hearings on U.S. installations
                            abroad. Those newspaper stories were picked up in Morocco, and the
                            opposition party and press made a good thing of the idea that the U.S.
                            still had a “base” in Morocco. The Moroccan government handled the
                            problem reasonably well, saying that this was not a U.S. base and that
                            the main activity there was training Moroccans with some U.S.
                            communications on the side.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of that political flurry, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> last November said he wanted to
                            discuss with you how he could show his people that the continuation of
                            this relationship with the U.S. at Kenitra worked to their advantage.
                            Robert Murphy was asked to talk with the King about this. His assessment
                            was that the King did not wish to get rid of the U.S. installation but
                            was angling for more aid in return for it. Apparently he <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d112-02" facs="d112-02"/>remembered the arrangement he had
                            made directly with President <persName>Kennedy</persName> and had in
                            mind capitalizing on his forthcoming state visit to get something more
                            for the facility.</p>
                        <p>A complete intra-U.S. Government review has now taken place, and the Navy
                            [text not declassified] concluded that it would be helpful if our
                            facilities could remain in being as long as possible, although if
                            popular political pressure in Morocco mounted, we would withdraw and
                            duplicate their function as much as possible in Spain and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Present Problem</p>
                        <p>The present problem, therefore, is to explain to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> our requirements in relation to
                            the Kenitra facilities and our general programming for military and
                            economic assistance to Morocco. The purpose of the present exercise is
                            to get as much of this settled before he comes on his state visit at the
                            end of April, so that you will not have to do more than simply note that
                            a satisfactory understanding has been reached. This cannot be guaranteed
                            because the King has a notion that the way to do business on something
                            like this is between heads of state. But as much will be done as
                            possible to save you from anything more than a simple ratification of a
                            general understanding.</p>
                        <p>The line of action which has been proposed through the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> system is to instruct Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> to go to the King
                            and to make the following points in your name:</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. has appreciated its continued access to these
                            facilities.<lb/>—The U.S. has not tied its assistance programs to
                            Morocco to our continued access to the base. Our economic aid program
                            (over $660 million through 1969) has been based on our estimates not
                            only of Moroccan economic requirements but also our general friendly
                            relationship with Morocco.<lb/>—The President wishes the King to know
                            that, subject to Congressional appropriations, the U.S. will continue to
                            assist Morocco in the future because of our continued interest in
                            Morocco's legitimate security and development needs.<lb/>
                            <pb n="3" xml:id="d112-03" facs="d112-03"/> —With regard to Kenitra, at
                            any time His Majesty concludes that our presence there poses
                            unacceptable political liabilities to him we would understand and would
                            be prepared to discuss with his government altering our presence as
                            appropriate. In fact, some changes are already being made. We hope that
                            the Moroccan government will find a way of conveying to the Moroccan
                            people a full understanding of the substantial U.S. economic and
                            military assistance the U.S. has provided. Morocco is the largest
                            African recipient of U.S. economic and military assistance since World
                            War II.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> would also be
                            authorized, at his discretion, to review with the King our plans for
                            general economic and military assistance through <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1972. This would include $15 million in military credit
                            in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 and again in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. This will require a Presidential
                            determination that it is important to U.S. interests to provide this
                            amount, but that has been included in your Budget. At the same time, the
                            Navy will make improvements at the installation, which will benefit the
                            Moroccans, which will total approximately $14 million and will expand
                            the telecommunications school for the Moroccan military.</p>
                        <p>The one issue in this approach is whether Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> should be authorized to speak
                            to the King about aid levels. The argument against doing so is that if
                            the King were to raise the subject here when he comes, you would not
                            have anything new to offer. However, it seems desirable to make some
                            effort to give the King fully what we have in mind and then tell him, in
                            the course of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                            >Rockwell</persName>'s presentation, that you hope this subject can be
                            laid aside so that other matters of common concern may be discussed
                            during the King's visit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>In short, this is a holding action. We do not believe that the King
                            really wants us to leave. He wants a continuing association with the
                            U.S. He also wants as much military and economic assistance as he can
                            get from us. The amount that has been offered is as much as we can do
                            within the scope of our appropriations and what the Moroccans can
                            use.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> opened the
                            conversation by saying that the King of Morocco had asked him to come to
                            express his warm feeling for the United States. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> said, “The King had looked
                            forward to his State Visit on April 22. We are very conscious of the
                            efforts of the United States to ease relations in the Middle East. We
                            are also conscious of the fact that my visit in June was followed by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> plan. Morocco has used
                            its influence to get the <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            plan accepted. Since then <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            has died. Many changes have occurred—<persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s death and various peace proposals. We have good
                            relations with the UAR and they check everything with us. We have kept
                            up the pressure to maintain the ceasefire but the present circumstances
                            are very delicate. His Majesty has asked that there be an urgent
                            convening of the Arab Summit. We want to bring the Arab World to
                            realism. Our objective is to get more realism into the outlook of the
                            Arabs. The planned meeting would coincide with the <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d113-02" facs="d113-02"/>visit of His Majesty to the U.S.
                            and it is obvious that his Majesty cannot absent himself from a Summit
                            he himself has called.</p>
                        <p>Last week His Majesty received emissaries from Hussein and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>. We are the only Arabs who
                            are on good terms with all other Arabs. This has produced a series of
                            dilemmas for the King. Either to come but not speak at the National
                            Press Club and on Meet the Press, which is against his nature, or to
                            have the public appearances and thereby jeopardize the Summit. We
                            recognize that these trips are planned months ahead and therefore we
                            have two proposals to make. One, we could turn the visit <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d113-03" facs="d113-03"/>into a private one. His Majesty
                            would arrive in the morning and leave in the evening. Or, we could
                            postpone the visit. Above all, His Majesty wants it to be clear that
                            nothing that is done will affect the bilateral relationship. His Majesty
                            leaves the decision up to the President.”</p>
                        <p>The President said, “I agree completely with the role of Morocco. Morocco
                            is the most stable and objective nation in the area. Secondly, we want
                            to enhance His Majesty's role and we will do whatever His Majesty wants.
                            If he came on a private visit he need not make any public speeches. On
                            the other hand, we want to give His Majesty the honor befitting his
                            station and that would suggest that a dinner would be better than a
                            lunch, so if he came on a private visit he should plan to stay
                            overnight. But we would like to work it out, whichever is more
                            convenient.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LA1">Laraki</persName> said, “His Majesty has left
                            me the discussion of turning it into a private visit or postponement. I
                            believe that turning it into a private visit might appear to some that
                            the best Arab friend of the U.S. was being treated in a cavalier way,
                            and a certain sector of the press would exploit it. Therefore, let us
                            postpone the visit until June or October. If by then there has been an
                            Arab Summit we will brief you on it; if not, we will give you our view
                            of the situation. It was noticeable that now the Arab Summit seemed much
                            less imminent.” There was then some desultory conversation about
                            possible dates, and the meeting ended.</p>

                        <p>In its A-97 of May 19, the Embassy forwarded to the Department an
                            analysis by Mr. Edward Djerejian, the Labor-Political Officer at
                            Casablanca, recommending a reorientation of U.S. policy in Morocco. Mr.
                            Djerejian maintained that we are over-committed to Morocco and that our
                            real interest here is in supporting an independent and democratic
                            Morocco which will be able to achieve the social and economic
                            development which is the basis of social justice. We made no comment on
                            his analysis at that time but promised one later. A group of substantive
                            officers and I have since discussed the report at some length with Mr.
                            Djerejian himself and the following represents a distillation of our
                            principal comments on the paper.</p>
                        <p>First of all, we all agree that Mr. Djerejian has done a useful job in
                            focusing our attention on important aspects of our policy toward Morocco
                            and of forcing us to reexamine some of the fundamental concepts under
                            which we have been operating. I think he is to be commended for his
                            imaginative and thoughtful analysis. We do not agree with all of it but
                            we think it is provocative and worth discussing.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. Djerejian's recommendations amount to, we think, is that we
                            dissociate ourselves from the regime and that we encourage those
                            elements which are by their nature opposed to <pb n="2" xml:id="d114-02"
                                facs="d114-02"/>autocratic government in Morocco. This assumes the
                            existence of such elements and that they are likely contenders for
                            power. I do not know that such elements, having a realistic possibility
                            of attaining power, do in fact exist. All observers seem to be agreed
                            that the only likely force to mount a revolution here is the Army, and I
                            do not think we would find the Army any less autocratic or more
                            effective in promoting the social and economic development of the
                            country than is the present regime. Nor do I think that lessening of our
                            economic support to the regime would promote the economic and social
                            development of the country.</p>
                        <p>There are two fundamental assumptions of Mr. Djerejian's analysis which
                            seem open to question. One is that we are overcommitted here and the
                            other is that radical change is inevitable. We have had a long
                            discussion about whether or not we are overcommitted; I think we can all
                            agree that our present commitment is an inheritance from the past. Were
                            we to arrive on the scene today and were there no naval communications
                            facilities here, I doubt we would decide that Morocco should be the
                            largest <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> recipient country in Africa.
                            We would probably put some of that money some place else. The point is,
                            however, that we are not arriving fresh on the scene and that to alter
                            radically the level of our bilateral aid to Morocco would inevitably
                            affect our relations with this government and would affect our tenure at
                            Kenitra, Sidi Yahya and Bouknadel. I personally do not feel that in the
                            circumstances we are overcommitted. While there may be some question
                            about the utilization of some of the aid we have given Morocco, I think
                            in general it has been well used and that our aid Mission is doing an
                            effective job of stimulating the Moroccan government into rational
                            change. We are getting value for our money in terms of our tenure at
                            Kenitra and the other installations, and I understand that those
                            installations are in fact of great value to our military forces.</p>
                        <p>We also find it difficult to accept the thesis that radical change here
                            is inevitable. One can compare the population and unemployment figures
                            with the pace of economic development and look at the examples set by
                            other Arab countries and conclude that radical change within the next 10
                            years is possible, or even likely, but one should not conclude that it
                            is inevitable. We hold no brief for King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> but we do not think one should sell him short. A
                            great deal of money and effort has gone into the building of <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d114-03" facs="d114-03"/>infrastructure in this country, and
                            they are on the eve of paying off—structures like the new dams on the
                            lower Moulouya and the Ziz Rivers are only now beginning to perform
                            their planned functions. An era of agricultural development is opening
                            up which may change many of our basic assumptions. It certainly is in
                            our interests that these efforts come to fruition, that Morocco continue
                            to enjoy stability and a reasonable degree of freedom and that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> succeed in bringing
                            this country through its transition from a traditional to a modern state
                            by peaceful means. We may not approve totally of the way he is doing it,
                            but our experiences with the Shah of Iran show that we are not always
                            right about such things.</p>
                        <p>We fully agree with Mr. Djerejian that we should do what we can to urge
                            the regime to increase popular participation in the development effort
                            and to make better utilization of its human resources. Our leverage in
                            this regard should not be overestimated, however, and a constant harping
                            on this theme is likely to reduce our effectiveness. We also agree that
                            we should not associate ourselves with the repressive political aspects
                            of the regime and will do our best to avoid doing so, We doubt, however,
                            that we could do much to change the regime's attitude or tactics towards
                            the radical opposition, nor are we sure it would be wise to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Djerejian recommended that we undertake an intensive informational
                            and cultural effort to communicate and cultivate Moroccan youth and
                            potential leaders. We are already carrying out a fairly active program
                            in this regard, principally through <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss>, and there are built-in limitations as to how far we
                            can go because of the regime's desire to control contacts between
                            foreigners and Moroccans. Our new Embassy Youth Committee is at the
                            moment considering possibilities for new approaches in this field and it
                            may be that we will decide</p>

                        <p>In its A-97 of May 19, the Embassy forwarded to the Department an
                            analysis by Mr. Edward Djerejian, the Labor-Political Officer at
                            Casablanca, recommending a reorientation of U.S. policy in Morocco. Mr.
                            Djerejian maintained that we are over-committed to Morocco and that our
                            real interest here is in supporting an independent and democratic
                            Morocco which will be able to achieve the social and economic
                            development which is the basis of social justice. We made no comment on
                            his analysis at that time but promised one later. A group of substantive
                            officers and I have since discussed the report at some length with Mr.
                            Djerejian himself and the following represents a distillation of our
                            principal comments on the paper.</p>
                        <p>First of all, we all agree that Mr. Djerejian has done a useful job in
                            focusing our attention on important aspects of our policy toward Morocco
                            and of forcing us to reexamine some of the fundamental concepts under
                            which we have been operating. I think he is to be commended for his
                            imaginative and thoughtful analysis. We do not agree with all of it but
                            we think it is provocative and worth discussing.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. Djerejian's recommendations amount to, we think, is that we
                            dissociate ourselves from the regime and that we encourage those
                            elements which are by their nature opposed to autocratic government in
                            Morocco. This assumes the existence of such elements and that they are
                            likely contenders for power. I do not know that such elements, having a
                            realistic possibility of attaining power, do in fact exist. All
                            observers seem to be agreed that the only likely force to mount a
                            revolution here is the Army, and I do not think we would find the Army
                            any less autocratic or more effective in promoting the social and
                            economic development of the country than is the present regime. Nor do I
                            think that lessening of our economic support to the regime would promote
                            the economic and social development of the country.</p>
                        <p>There are two fundamental assumptions of Mr. Djerejian's analysis which
                            seem open to question. One is that we are overcommitted here and the
                            other is that radical change is inevitable. We have had a long
                            discussion about whether or not we are overcommitted; I think we can all
                            agree that our present commitment is an inheritance from the past. Were
                            we to arrive on the scene today and were there no naval communications
                            facilities here, I doubt we would decide that Morocco should be the
                            largest AID recipient country in Africa. We would probably put some of
                            that money some place else. The point is, however, that we are not
                            arriving fresh on the scene and that to alter radically the level of our
                            bilateral aid to Morocco would inevitably affect our relations with this
                            government and would affect our tenure at Kenitra, Sidi Yahya and
                            Bouknadel. I personally do not feel that in the circumstances we are
                            overcommitted. While there may be some question about the utilization of
                            some of the aid we have given Morocco, I think in general it has been
                            well used and that our aid Mission is doing an effective job of
                            stimulating the Moroccan government into rational change. We are getting
                            value for our money in terms of our tenure at Kenitra and the other
                            installations, and I understand that those installations are in fact of
                            great value to our military forces.</p>
                        <p>We also find it difficult to accept the thesis that radical change here
                            is inevitable. One can compare the population and unemployment figures
                            with the pace of economic development and look at the examples set by
                            other Arab countries and conclude that radical change within the next 10
                            years is possible, or even likely, but one should not conclude that it
                            is inevitable. We hold no brief for King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> but we do not think one should sell him short. A
                            great deal of money and effort has gone into the building of
                            infrastructure in this country, and they are on the eve of paying
                            off—structures like the new dams on the lower Moulouya and the Ziz
                            Rivers are only now beginning to perform their planned functions. An era
                            of agricultural development is opening up which may change many of our
                            basic assumptions. It certainly is in our interests that these efforts
                            come to fruition, that Morocco continue to enjoy stability and a
                            reasonable degree of freedom and that King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> succeed in bringing this country through its
                            transition from a traditional to a modern state by peaceful means. We
                            may not approve totally of the way he is doing it, but our experiences
                            with the Shah of Iran show that we are not always right about such
                            things.</p>
                        <p>We fully agree with Mr. Djerejian that we should do what we can to urge
                            the regime to increase popular participation in the development effort
                            and to make better utilization of its human resources. Our leverage in
                            this regard should not be overestimated, however, and a constant harping
                            on this theme is likely to reduce our effectiveness. We also agree that
                            we should not associate ourselves with the repressive political aspects
                            of the regime and will do our best to avoid doing so, We doubt, however,
                            that we could do much to change the regime's attitude or tactics towards
                            the radical opposition, nor are we sure it would be wise to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Djerejian recommended that we undertake an intensive informational
                            and cultural effort to communicate and cultivate Moroccan youth and
                            potential leaders. We are already carrying out a fairly active program
                            in this regard, principally through <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss>, and there are built-in limitations as to how far we
                            can go because of the regime's desire to control contacts between
                            foreigners and Moroccans. Our new Embassy Youth Committee is at the
                            moment considering possibilities for new approaches in this field and it
                            may be that we will decide to reexamine or retread some of our present
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Djerejian also recommended that we expand our contacts with
                            representative social and political groups such as the trade union
                            movement. From discussion with Mr. Djerejian we have learned that he has
                            in mind more the question of contacts between diplomatic representatives
                            here and labor leaders in Casablanca, for example. We have no problem
                            with this and will try to improve our track record.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d114-04" facs="d114-04"/>
                        <p>Mr. Djerejian recommends expanding unilateral and multilateral assistance
                            and eliminating bilateral assistance except for Promotion Nationale,
                            Peace Corps and unilateral programs. We have also discussed this at some
                            length and believe we have convinced Mr. Djerejian that in terms of his
                            stated goal of promoting the economic and social development of Morocco,
                            we have greater influence through a bilateral program than we would have
                            if we relied entirely on multilateral efforts, even assuming the latter
                            was possible under aid legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Djerejian recommends reducing military assistance levels, but his
                            recommendation seems to have been based upon a misunderstanding as to
                            the nature and level of our assistance. Our program today consists of
                            about $1 million grant aid and $10 million in credit sales each year.
                            This is already a very modest program and in the present circumstances
                            we think it is the minimum we can do and still make any effective
                            contribution to the Moroccan defense capability. We think Morocco does
                            need a defense capability and that it is in our interests to help
                            develop it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Djerejian recommends timely withdrawal from our
                            installations at Kenitra, Sidi Yahya and Bouknadel if they are no longer
                            in our strategic interests. We fully agree, but we believe that those
                            installations are in fact in our strategic interests at present. Or
                            rather, this is what we have been given to understand by Washington and
                            we are in no position to judge otherwise.</p>
                        <p>This discussion calls to mind the fact that we still have no national
                            policy paper for Morocco. We are aware of the problems with NSSM 87 but
                            it seems to us that a thoroughgoing discussion of what our interests are
                            and what we should be doing about them is still in order. If it does no
                            more than highlight the need for such a discussion, Mr. Djerejian's
                            paper will have served a useful purpose.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction</p>
                        <p>Although Morocco has distinctively North African characteristics and is a
                            part of the “Arab” (or at any rate, Islamic world), geography and the
                            economics of location have given it a very strong North and West
                            orientation. It is a key strategic land mass at the Atlantic end of the
                            Mediterranean, with old cultural and commercial ties with Spain and
                            France.</p>
                        <p>Historically, the prime American interest in Morocco has been to keep it
                            and its adjacent waters free from influences that might be detrimental
                            to the free flow of commerce and navigation. This is still a major
                            concern. Since World War II, however, we have had a more specific
                            strategic interest in the country, reflected in the 1950's by SAC bases
                            and now by the Kenitra Naval Communications Station. Over the years we
                            have developed something resembling a “special relationship” with the
                            Moroccan Government. This relationship has not only been significant in
                            the bilateral sense, it has helped provide on occasion a bridge of
                            understanding and comprehension to other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>Our commercial relations with Morocco are still relatively modest. As the
                            country develops, however, we would hope that the technical and
                            financial aid we have provided over the years, would give American
                            business a valuable entree.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. U.S. Interests in Morocco</p>
                        <p>1. The United States has a significant communications facility in the
                            Kenitra complex that is the master communications station for the
                            Mediterranean area and an important link in our world-wide
                            communications network.</p>
                        <p>2. In Tangier, the U.S. has an important <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> relay station.</p>
                        <p>3. Because of its development efforts, Morocco is potentially a modest
                            market for U.S. capital goods, services, and possibly for private
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>4. The US strategic interest in Morocco derives from its geographic
                            location and NATO's responsibility for defense of Western Europe. While
                            denial of military operating rights in Morocco will not significantly
                            restrict NATO's ability to <pb n="4" xml:id="d115-04" facs="d115-04"
                            />carry out its mission in the Mediterranean, NATO (particularly U.S.)
                            ability to pass freely through the Straits of Gibraltar is essential to
                            the protection of the southern flank of Europe.</p>
                        <p>5. Morocco, in contrast to a substantial part of the Arab world,
                            maintains a cordial relationship with the United States, thus providing
                            the US a valuable means of contact with a significant region.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. U.S. 0bjectives Over the Next Five Years</p>
                        <p>1. Continuation of cordial relations with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>2. Preservation of U.S. facilities at Kenitra and Tangier as long as they
                            are required.</p>
                        <p>3. Continuation of Morocco's generally moderate stance on the Middle East
                            problem and receptiveness to U.S. views on matters of mutual
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>4. More rapid and rational economic and social development of
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>5. Continued access to Morocco by U.S. goods, services and capital on a
                            non-discriminatory basis.</p>
                        <p>6. Increased Western European economic and military assistance and
                            increased international organization economic assistance to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>7. A preservation of Moroccan independence at least to the extent that it
                            not be used by a hostile power capable of effective military action
                            against NATO interests.</p>

                            States</p>
                        <p>1. Use U.S. as counterweight to French presence in political and
                            economic/military assistance fields.</p>
                        <p>2. Maximize U.S. contribution to economic development plans.</p>
                        <p>3. Maximize U.S. military assistance.</p>
                        <p>4. Maintain U.S. interest in Morocco, through Kenitra, to the extent this
                            does not become an unacceptable political (internal and/or external)
                            liability to the Moroccan Government.</p>
                        <p>5. Obtain U.S. support to influence the Spanish towards a settlement on
                            the Saharan issue.</p>

                        <p>1. Recognize that over next five years maximum possible US support for
                            the Moroccan development effort best assures <gloss target="#t_GOM1"
                                >GOM</gloss> ability and willingness to cope with economic and
                            social problems that are likely to grow more critical in the late
                            seventies.</p>
                        <p>2. Attempt to keep our use of the Kenitra communications facility out of
                            a quid-pro-quo context and as a part of our overall relationship while
                            at the same time insuring that the Moroccans realize the value of this
                            total relationship.</p>
                        <p>3. Continue the present 10 million dollar annual level of military sales
                            credits, stretched to the extent possible by sales from excess military
                            materiel stocks at nominal prices, at least as long as we remain at
                            Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>4. Increase grant military assistance for training to the former annual
                            level of 1.2 million dollars, at least as long as we remain at
                            Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>5. If we decide we desire to remain at Kenitra, assure allocation yearly
                            of sufficient US-owned excess foreign currency and dollar funds to
                            maintain and operate the base and to provide continued training to
                            Moroccan military personnel.</p>
                        <p>6. While leaving King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and
                            senior Moroccan officials in no doubt about U.S. confidence in the
                            capacity of the regime to deal with current and future problems, put
                            greater stress within U.S. aid programs on help to the Moroccans to
                            solve increasing urban social and economic problems.</p>
                        <p>7. Continue <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 assistance to Morocco
                            in a volume related to the needs of the economy.</p>
                        <p>8. Provide development loans, as appropriate, in cooperation with the

                        <p>9. Continue US technical assistance for selective high priority
                            development needs where the United States has a capacity for offering
                            superior services. In this connection, place special emphasis on

                        <p>11. Insure long term <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> commitment to

                        <p>12. Contingent upon improved administrative procedures, encourage

                            low-cost housing, preparatory work on tourist complexes, and
                            construction of a chain of national camp sites.</p>
                        <p>13. Contingent upon improved administrative procedures, examine with
                            Promotion Nationale possibilities for projects of vocational training
                            programs geared to public and private sector employment needs.</p>
                        <p>14. Encourage and cooperate where practicable with the Peace Corps, with
                            foreign bilateral donors, and with international agencies in regional
                            vocational training and civic programs designed to provide basic skills
                            for the agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>15. Increase exchanges of persons in educational and technical fields,
                            with particular emphasis on identifying and cultivating promising young
                            people.</p>
                        <p>16. Maintain and expand discreet contacts with opposition, student,
                            labor, and youth groups.</p>
                        <p>17. Maintain an active information program that deals directly with
                            press, radio and TV.</p>
                        <p>18. Maintain cultural presentations, exhibits, English teaching,

                        </list>
                        <p>The following is the situation in Morocco based on the most recent
                            reports available: </p>
                        <p>—A disaffected group of Moroccan military apparently led by three Army
                            Brigadiers, Military Region Commander, and a Lt. Colonel, who commands
                            the Non-Commissioned Officers School, today attempted a coup against
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. The attack was made
                            on the Royal Palace near Rabat where the King was hosting a large group
                            of diplomats and notables in celebration of his 42nd birthday.</p>
                        <p>—The affair at the Palace was bloody but the King was not harmed. The
                            Belgium Ambassador and several other important figures apparently were
                            killed. The King's brother reportedly is seriously wounded.</p>
                        <p>—We have no reports on Americans being harmed although Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> and other Americans
                            were present at the King's celebration.</p>
                        <p>—The King still is in control of the situation and has given full
                            military and civilian powers to Interior Minister, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>.</p>
                        <p>—The King is expected shortly to broadcast an appeal over Moroccan radio
                            to the people and the Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>—The King and the Queen are reportedly aboard a Moroccan Naval vessel off
                            the coast. </p>
                        <p>—At this time order seems to be returning and the coup attempt apparently
                            has failed.</p>
                        <p>I will provide you with a more detailed status report and assessment of
                            the implications of this coup attempt tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>The attempt to overthrow King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> II of Morocco apparently has failed, although
                            some sporadic fighting continues and some of the rebels are still to be
                            rounded up.</p>
                        <p>The latest reporting from our Embassy indicates that the situation seems
                            to be normal everywhere in the country except Rabat. There is still,
                            however, occasional firing in the downtown area of the capital city,
                            particularly around the radio station and near army headquarters. The
                            Royal Palace apparently is still in rebel hands. All known principals of
                            the coup attempt are reported to be either dead or arrested.</p>
                        <p>From all indications King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            is unharmed and, after initially putting out to sea, he has returned to
                            a small palace that he maintains outside of Rabat. In a radio statement,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> said Morocco had
                            passed through the most serious crisis in its history and declared the
                            army remains loyal.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Interior General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >Oufkir</persName> has been given full military and civilian powers
                            to restore order and clean out the rebels and, for all practical
                            purposes, is the man actually running the country at this moment. He is
                            a very tough, well-seasoned and controversial figure characterized in
                            the past by both his loyalty to the King and harshness in suppressing
                            opposition. If he bails out Hassan this time, <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> can be expected to play a very
                            influential role in the future. He is reported to be well disposed to
                            the U. S. and the West but as a pragmatist he is capable of being
                            accommodating to the Soviets if he thought this were in Morocco's
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans reportedly have placed their armed forces on alert and have
                            proclaimed their support for the rebels. The King reacted to this
                            announcement with utter contempt. It is doubtful at this point that the
                            Libyans will <pb n="2" xml:id="d117-02" facs="d117-02"/>go beyond
                            propaganda and perhaps threats. The Algerians have not committed
                            themselves one way or the other and seem to be lying low. So far no
                            other government in the area has taken any public position.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Action:</p>
                        <p>The State Department has reviewed its emergency evacuation plans for the
                            some 5,000 American nationals in Morocco of whom 3,400 are military
                            personnel and dependents stationed at the Kenitra Base. No Americans
                            have been harmed or are in serious danger. Should the situation take an
                            unexpected turn for the worse, ships from the Sixth Fleet could be
                            rapidly positioned for evacuation purposes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> and the
                            Department of State have recommended that you send a message

                            successful escape from the attempt on his life and expressing hope for
                            future peace and stability. The situation appears to have clarified
                            sufficiently to make such a gesture which will be greatly appreciated by
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. I have approved
                            dispatch of the attached message, leaving it to the Ambassador's
                            discretion as to manner and timing of delivery. He will advise when the
                            message has been conveyed. We will then consider the possibility of
                            acknowledging here to the press that you have sent a message.</p>

                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The near-miss coup attempt of July 10 in Morocco—which resulted in a
                            savage internecine army bloodbath—is now effectively quelled. The full
                            details of the military conspiracy and of what actually transpired at
                            the tragic birthday party remain yet to be clarified, but the events of
                            July add up to a major turning point in the reign of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. His relationship to the army
                            has changed significantly and, although presently secure, he seems in
                            greater eventual jeopardy than ever before from basic military and
                            civilian discontent.</p>
                        <p>Army's Loyalty Shattered—The senior military leadership, split between
                            rebels and loyalists, is severely decimated. Nine of the country's 16
                            generals are known to have been killed or executed thus far, and
                            numerous colonels, majors, and lower-ranking officers have died. But the
                            prime casualty was the idea that the army gave monolithic and
                            unconditional loyalty to the monarch. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>, founder and commander-in-chief of the Royal
                            Armed Forces, had assiduously cultivated the myth and almost certainly
                            regarded the military as indispensable. The coup attempt has cast doubt
                            on the military establishment. While <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> understandably has publicly maintained that the
                            army remains “pure and honest”, his top surviving military supporters,
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d118-02" facs="d118-02"/>Generals Mohamed Oufkir
                            and Driss Ben Aomar, are leading a hunt for those in the army allied to
                            or sympathetic toward the conspirators. Presumably, a thorough-going
                            purge of the officer corps—which may have been much more broadly
                            implicated in the coup affair than is presently known—will ensue. Even
                            so, the army probably cannot be put together again as a wholly loyal
                            instrument of royal will. The wholesale slaughter of brother officers
                            could well set in motion deep-seated resentments and blood revenge
                            motives within the clannish Berbers, who make up most of the senior
                            officer corps. And the vacancies in higher ranks raise the inevitable
                            prospect of promotion into command responsibilities for the
                            better-educated younger generation of middle-grade officers, a group

                            the army officers' revolt remain unclear, substantial military
                            dissatisfaction on several scores has been evident over the past year.
                            The King's decision to restore constitutional government and parliament
                            in the summer of 1970 (after five years of emergency rule in which the
                            military and security forces had a largely unfettered hand) was not
                            popular in military ranks even though army officers were given a role in
                            managing the elections. Of probably greater significance was military
                            unhappiness over blatant corruption and <pb n="3" xml:id="d118-03"
                                facs="d118-03"/>favoritism of high civilian ministers and
                            officials—not that all the military were immune. A corruption scandal in
                            April sullied the regime's reputation, led the King to postpone his
                            visit to the US, and obliged him to dismiss four ministers and other
                            lesser officials. The military were also displeased over the King's
                            Algerian policy which, in the eyes of nationalist army officers,
                            appeared to amount to virtual capitulation on Morocco's long-standing
                            border claims.</p>
                        <p>The loyalist military leaders, on whom the King is dependent to a greater
                            degree than ever before, have an innate antipathy toward the existing
                            political system, viewing parties as basically demagogic and civilian
                            officials as venal and ineffective. To rally morale in the military,
                            they will almost certainly request—and receive in the coming
                            months—accelerated promotions and increased arms of impressive
                            proportions. Moreover, they are likely to exploit their present
                            bargaining position to press for a more efficient, perhaps military-led,
                            government and for policies with popular appeal and more nationalist
                            content. They may press the King to seek revisions in the US military
                            presence at Kenitra if not satisfied with American responsiveness to
                            present and likely additional requests for arms.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s Longer-Term Dilemma:
                            Restoring a Political Balance. To a considerable extent, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is himself responsible for his
                            present predicament: over-reliance on his military establishment. His
                            consummate success over 11 years of rule in progressively concentrating
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d118-04" facs="d118-04"/>virtually all effective
                            powers in his hands destroyed the balance of political forces on which
                            the monarchy rested when he acceded to the throne in 1961. Political
                            parties, trade unions, and other civilian political forces eroded into
                            near impotence, leaving the King virtually alone with the military. By
                            relying heavily on the security forces to repress popular discontent,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> contained potential
                            trouble but deepened resentment against the regime. And by disregarding
                            the military officers' dissatisfactions over policy and the course of
                            domestic events, the King became increasingly vulnerable to the kind of
                            military reaction that occurred on July 10. Even though he has mustered
                            sufficient army support to overcome that challenge, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s existing relationship with the
                            military leaves him basically vulnerable. He may attempt to neutralize
                            the military, seeking even more than in the past to play against one
                            another various army units as well as the security police, gendarmerie,
                            and auxiliary forces. But he is unlikely willingly to alter his
                            autocratic style of rule or allow civilian political groups to develop
                            into a significant opposing force. As a consequence, King <persName

                            jeopardy over the longer term than ever before</p>

                        <p>1. SUMMARY - WHATEVER MOTIVATIONS OF COUP PLOTTERS WERE, KING <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName> NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS LIFE STYLE
                            AND WAY OF DOING BUSINESS IF HE IS TO SURVIVE. HIS INITIAL REACTIONS TO
                            COUP INDICATE HE SEEKING RATIONALIZE EVENTS RATHER THAN ANALYZING THEIR
                            CAUSES AND MODIFYING HIS POLICIES ACCORDINGLY. THIS SOUNDS LIKE RECIPE
                            FOR CONTINUED INSTABILITY.</p>
                        <p>2. WHILE SITUATION IN MOROCCO HAS RETURNED TO SOMETHING APPROACHING
                            NORMALCY, THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME AS BEFORE. THUS, THERE ARE POLICE
                            ROADBLOCKS AT THE EXITS FROM THE CITY (AND ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY),
                            THERE AHE NUMEROUS SOLDIERS IN EVIDENCE AROUND RESIDENCES OF MOULAY

                            US, AND THERE IS GENERAL AIR OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO FUTURE. SKHIRAT IS

                            OF CASABLANCA'S CONTACTS SAYS, WE ARE DROWNING IN HYPOTHESES.</p>
                        <p>3. SETTING ASIDE PREDICATABLE RUMORS AND ALLEGATIONS OF FOREIGN
                            INVOLVEMENT, WHICH NO ONE IN AUTHORITY EXCEPT KING SEEMS TO TAKE
                            SERIOUSLY, THERE ARE STILL ONLY TWO BROAD THEMES INVOKED TO EXPLAIN
                            COUP. ONE IS CORRUPTION SUCH AS QTE RAMPANT QTE ARE WIDELY USED IN
                            DESCRIBING CORRUPTION HERE, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED (OUR A-71 OF
                            APRIL 6, 1971) THAT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE HARD TO FIX. IT HAS CERTAINLY
                            BEEN LESS BLATANT THAN IT WAS IN FAROUK'S EGYPT) OR IDRISS' LIBYA.
                            CORRUPTION IS A POPULAR ISSUE, HOWEVER, AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A
                            MAJOR PREOCCUPATION WITH <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName>. IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE <persName
                                corresp="#p_Medbouh1">MEDBOUH</persName> AND ABABOU BEING ABLE TO
                            GET OTHER OFFICERS AND THEIR SUBORDINATES WORKED UP ABOUT IT, EVEN
                            THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MERE BENEFICIARIES OF THE SYSTEM.</p>
                        <p>4. WHAT SEEMS TO BOTHER THE STUDENT FROM WAZZAN MORE THAN CORRUPTION,
                            HOWEVER, IS THE KING'S LIFE STYLE, WHICH IS CONTRASTED UNFAVORABLY WITH
                            THAT OF MUHAMMAD V, WHOM EVERYONE REMEMBERS AS A MAN OF SIMPLE HABITS.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName>'S FLAMBOYANT TASTE IN
                            CLOTHES, HIS NUMEROUS PALACES, AND THE PRESUMED HIGH LIVING THAT GOES ON
                            INSIDE THEM, WHILE NEEDED GOVERNMENT ACTIONS ARE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF
                            LACK OF MONEY, HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY ALIENATED MANY CONSERVATIVES, AS WELL AS
                            LIBERALS. A POOR MUSIC STUDENT ASKS, FOR INSTANCE, “WHY DOES HASSAN KEEP
                            BUILDING NEW PALACES WHEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A CONSERVATORY?”
                            ESSENTIALLY SAME QUESTION IS POSED IN DIFFERENT WAYS BY DIFFERENT
                            PEOPLE, BUT IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO A QUERY AS TO WHY THE KING IS LIVING SO
                            HIGH ON THE HOG IF THE COUNTRY IS SO POOR. THE POPULAR ANSWER IS A
                            CONCLUSION THAT HE IS NOT VIRTUOUS, THAT HE IS THEREFORE NOT ENTITLED TO
                            RULE, AND THAT HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE LEFT HE CAN
                            TRUST. IN PAST PEOPLE HAVE PUT THE BLAME ON THOSE AROUND <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName> RATHER THAN ON HIM. THEY NO
                            LONGER SEEM INCLINED TO GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THAT DOUBT.</p>
                        <p>5. THE SECOND THEME, PERSONAL AMBITION, HAS TAKEN SECOND PLACE TO
                            CORRUPTION IN THE REPORTS OF MOST WESTERN OBSERVERS. WE FIND IT HARD TO
                            BELIEVE, FOR INSTANCE, THAT MEDBOUBH WAS <pb n="3" xml:id="d119-03"
                                facs="d119-03"/>MOTIVATED SIMPLY BY A DESIRE FOR MORE POWER. ON THE
                            OTHER HAND, WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName> AND HIS CO-CONSPIRATORS WERE ALREADY ENJOYING
                            THE FRUITS OF POWER, IT ALSO SEEMS CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED MORE OR THEY
                            WOULD NOT HAVE MOVED. THERE WERE NO DECLARATIONS OF INTENT TO STEP DOWN
                            AS SOON AS THE BODY POLITIC WAS PURIFIED, AND NO INDICATIONS OF ANY
                            CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT PLANS FUR REFORM. THE MORE ONE LOOKS AT THE COUP,
                            THE MORE IT LOOKS LIKE A SIMPLE POWER PLAY, BY AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE
                            INVOLVED, SUCH AS ABABOU AND HAMMOU. THE PLOTTERS INTENDED TO GET RID OF
                            THE KING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY. CORRUPTION WAS
                            A HANDY ISSUE, BUT THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE MADE MUCH OF IT. ABABOU
                            REPORTEDLY HARRANGUED PEOPLE AT THE ETAT MAJOR ABOUT CORRUPTION, BUT
                            THERE WERE NO DECLARATIONS ABOUT CORRUPT RULE AND NO CALL FOR THE
                            POPULACE TO RALLY AROUND THE STANDARD OF REVOLUTION ON RADIO. FAILURE TO
                            ISSUE SUCH RADIO APPEALS, WHICH WOULD HAVE STRUCK A RESPONSIVE CHORD,
                            CAN BE EXPLAINED BY LACK OF PRIOR PLANNING, BUT IT IS PERHAPS
                            SIGNIFICANT THAT MORE ATTENTION WAS NOT PAID TO THIS ASPECT BY THE
                            PLOTTERS.</p>
                        <p>6. THE TWO THEMES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IN ANY EVENT. BOTH WERE
                            UNDOUBTEDLY AT WORK. IF CORRUPTION WAS AND IS THE PRIMARY PROBLEM, THE
                            KING THEORETICALLY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, AND ABOUT HIS OWN LIFE
                            STYLE. PERSONAL AMBITION, HOWEVER, IS LIKELY TO BE A RECURRING PROBLEM,
                            WHATEVER HE DOES ABOUT CORRUPTION, UNTIL AND UNLESS HE CREATES SOME
                            VIABLE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THE ROYAL SPELL HAS NOW BEEN BROKEN.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1">MEDBOUH</persName> AND ABABOU HAVE
                            SHOWN THAT WAY, AND THE NEXT GROUP OF OFFICERS WILL BE MORE CAREFUL, AND
                            WILL HAVE ORGANIZED MORE SUPPORT IN ADVANCE.</p>
                        <p>7. THE REGIME WAS AND IS INSTITUTIONALLY VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT IS HEADED
                            BY AN AUTOCRATIC MONARCH AND MONARCHS ARE INCREASINGLY ANACHRONISTIC IN
                            TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES. EVEN IN MOROCCO, WHERE THE MONARCHY IS NATIVE
                            AND OF LONG <pb n="5" xml:id="d119-05" facs="d119-05"/>STANDING, THE
                            TRADITIONAL BASIS OF HASSAN'S KINGLY LEGITIMACY IS NOT ALONE SUFFICIENT
                            TO JUSTIFY HIS RULE IN MODERN TIMES. HIS ROLE AS COMMANDER OF THE
                            FAITHFUL AND HIS DESCENT FROM THE PROPHET MAY ASSURE HIM SOME
                            CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT, BUT HAVE NEVER CUT MUCH ICE IN MOROCCO WHEN IT
                            COMES TO BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES SUCH AS TRIBAL LOYALTIES, VENGEANCE,
                            SCHOOLS AND JOBS.</p>
                        <p>8. ABOVE SUI GENERIE WEAKNESS HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED BY KING'S REFUSAL TO
                            SHARE REAL POWER WITH OR SERIOUSLY CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE POLITICAL
                            INTEREST GROUPS, I.E., POLITICAL PARTIES, LABOR UNIONS, STUDENTS,
                            INTELLECTUALS, EVEN PROFESSIONALS AND BUSINESSMEN. HE HAS DENIED HIMSELF
                            STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM GIVING BROAD SPECTRUM OF INTEREST GROUPS, AS
                            OPPOSED TO FAVORED INDIVIDUALS, STAKE IN SUCCESS OF REGIME AND ITS
                            POLICIES. AND HE HAS FURTHER ALIENATED MANY MEMBERS OF SUCH GROUPS BY
                            HEAVY-HANDED USE OF STATE SECURITY FORCES AGAINST THEM. HE HAS CREATED
                            NO MEANINGFUL INSTITUTIONS, AND HAS DISMANTLED MOST OF THOSE THAT
                            EXISTED ALREADY (COMMENT IN LAST PARA CASABLANCA A-54 IS PERTINENT IN
                            THIS REGARD). THE ONE INSTITUTION TO WHICH HE PAID GREAT ATTENTION, THE
                            MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT, HAS JUST BITTEN THE HAND THAT FED IT.</p>
                        <p>9. THE ABOVE POLITICAL/INSTITUTIONAL LIABILITIES MUST BE ADDED SERIOUS
                            LACK OF DYNAMISM IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. WHILE GOM HAS
                            PURSUED REASONABLY RATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES, OVERALL PERFORMANCE HAS
                            SHOWN MARKED LACK OF URGENCY. AS DEPARTMENT WELL AWARE, ANNUAL PER
                            CAPITA INCOME AVERAGE JUST OVER $200 NATIONWIDE AND IS MUCH LOWER IN
                            RURAL AREAS. THERE IS VERY SERIOUS AND POLITICALLY DANGEROUS
                            UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT 27PC IN CASABLANCA, THE ECONOMIC
                            CAPITAL, AND RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT/UNDEREMPLOYMENT SITUATION IS PERHAPS
                            WORSE. SITUATION MADE PROGRESSIVELY WORSE BY POPULATION GROWTH.</p>
                        <p>10. SUCH PROBLEMS OF COURSE NOT UNIQUE TO MOROCCO, BUT POLITICAL DANGER
                            HERE STEMS FROM KNOWLEDGE THAT NOT ONLY IS <gloss target="#t_GOM1"
                                >GOM</gloss> UNDYNAMIC IN FACING DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS BUT ALSO THE
                            KING AND HIS MINISTERS ARE LIVING UNCOMMONLY WELL. PEOPLE CAN BEAR
                            HARDSHIP IF CONVINCED LEADERS ARE HARDWORKING, HONEST AND SINCERE
                            (NASSER'S FORMULA). THEY ARE NOT SO CONVINCED HERE.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d119-06" facs="d119-06"/>
                        <p>11. IMPLICIT IN ALL OF FOREGOING IS THAT IF KING CORRECTS THE WEAKNESSES
                            OF THE REGIME, AND CHANGES HIS PERSONAL STYLE, HE HAS A DECENT CHANCE OF
                            SURVIVAL. THE PROBLEM OF AMBITIONS AMONG OFFICERS MAY REMAIN, BUT CAN BE
                            BETTER CONTROLLED IF HE HAS SOME INSTITUTIONS OTHER THAN STATE SECURITY
                            APPARATUS ON WHICH HE CAN DEPEND FOR SUPPORT. HE WILL HAVE TO SHOW FAR
                            MORE VIGOR AND DEDICATION TO RUNNING COUNTRY THAN HE HAS TO DATE,
                            HOWEVER, HE MIGHT TAKE CLUE FROM HIS SHARIFIS, COUSIN, KING HUSSEIN, PUT
                            DOWN HIS GOLF CLUB, FOREGO HIS CONCUBINES, AND ROLL UP HIS SLEEVES. HE
                            WOULD DO EVEN BETTER TO EMULATE IRAN'S SHAH AND PROCLAIM AND PURSUE HIS
                            OWN WHITE REVOLUTION. WHATEVER HE DOES, KING MUST REALIZE HE IS IN
                            DESPERATE COMPETITION WITH SERIOUS COUNTERCLAIMANTS FOR POWER. HE WILL
                            HAVE TO WORK HARD IF HE IS TO WIN.</p>
                        <p>12. MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM AND ABOUT <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >HASSAN</persName> SINCE THE COUP INDICATES THAT, WHATEVER AGONIZING
                            INWARD REAPPRAISAL HE IS GOING THROUGH, HE IS OUTWARDLY SEEKING TO
                            RATIONALIZE THE COUP ATTEMPT BY ADDUCING OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE, MENTAL
                            INSTABILITY ON MEDBOUH'S PART, DRUGGED TROOPS, ETC., RATHER THAN
                            SERIOUSLY ANALYZING COUNTRY'S MALAISE AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
                            IT. THUS, ON THE ONE HAND HE TOLD <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName>'S BROTHER-IN-LAW OTHMAN BENJELLOUN ON JULY 17
                            THAT HENCEFORTH THE WATCHWORD WAS TO BE AUSTERITY, AND ON THE OTHER WE
                            HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD HE SENT THE KENITRA GOLF PRO OFF TO ENGLAND ON JULY
                            21 TO BUY 42 PAIRS OF GOLF SHOES FOR THE PALACE ENTOURAGE. IF THIS
                            REFLECTS HIS APPRECIATION OF HIS SITUATION, WE CAN VISUALIZE HIM TRYING
                            TO DO BUSINESS AS USUAL EXCEPT FOR INCREASED RELIANCE ON FEWER PEOPLE
                            AND ON MORE STRINGENT REPRESSIVE MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE
                            RECIPE FOR CONTINUED INSTABILITY AND WE SHARE VIEWS OF MOHAMED

                        <p>1. REFERENCE IN REFTEL TO POSSIBLE MAJOR CHANGE IN REQUIREMENTS AND
                            POLICIES OF <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> MILITARY LEADERSHIP WAS
                            BASED ON REPORT THAT LT. COL. AMEKRANE, MOROCCAN COMMANDER KENITRA BASE,
                            GAVE TO CHIEF MUSLO ON AUGUST OF CONVERSATION HE HAD HAD WITH MINISTER
                            OF DEFENSE GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> ON
                            AUGUST 10. AMEKRANE SAID HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED BY <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> TO CONTACT CHIEF MUSLO FOR
                            PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHAT <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> COULD DO
                            FOR MOROCCO. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> REPORTED TO
                            HAVE SAID MOROCCO IS ANTI-COMMUNIST, DOES NOT WANT TO BE DEPENDENT ON
                            SOVIET UNION, DOES NOT WANT <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> TO BE
                            IN COMMAND OF MEDITERRANEAN, AND THAT HE WANTED MOROCCO TO BE INTEGRATED
                            INTO WESTERN DEFENSE. ACCORDING TO AMEKRANE, <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >OUFKIR</persName> SAID HE WANTED TO PLAY SAME GAME WITH US THAT
                            ALGERIA HAS BEEN PLAYING WITH SOVIET UNION, IN WHICH ALGERIA HAS BEEN
                            GIVEN A LOT OF SOVIET EQUIPMENT THAT IS BEING OPERATED BY SOVIET
                            MILITARY. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> FURTHER
                            REPORTEDLY STATED “WE ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE A WESTERN COUNTRY AND MUST
                            HAVE STABILITY, AND IN COOPERATION WITH THE US DEVELOP OUR COUNTRY.”</p>
                        <p>2. AMEKRANE ALSO SAID OUFKIR WANTED MUSLO TO MAKE COMPLETE FORCE STUDY OF
                            HIS ENTIRE MILITARY ORGANIZATION, WAS CANCELLING ALL PRIORITIES Of
                            CREDIT PURCHASES AND WAS POSTPONING TRIP OF MORROCAN DELEGATION TO U.S.
                            HE QUOTED <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> AS SAYING HE
                            WOULD WELCOME AMERICAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN MOROCCO AND WANTED A LARGE
                            ADVISORY GRGUP SUCH AS IRAN HAS. WHEN ASKED WHETHER OUKFIR HAD TO HAVE
                            APPROVAL OF KING, AMEKRANE SAID KING HAD CHARGED OUFKIR WITH DEVELOPMENT
                            OF ARMED FORCES, GIVEN HIM CARTE BLANC, AND DELEGATED DECISION MAKING
                            AUTHORITY TO HIM. CHIEF MUSLO WAS ADVISED HE WOULD BE CALLED FOR A
                            MEETING WITHIN 72 HOURS. WE DID NOT REPORT THESE DETAILS AT TIME BECAUSE

                            BEING CANCELLED AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO RELY ON MUSLO'S RECOMMENDATIONS
                            RE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName>
                            STRESSED VIEW THAT MAIN MISSION OF MOROCCAN ARMED FORCES IS DEFENSIVE
                            AND THAT OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM SHOULD BE TO HELP PROVIDE SUITABLE AND
                            PRACTICAL MATERIAL. HE DID NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, WANT “SCHOOL FOR
                            ASTRONAUTS,” BUT RATHER TO INCLUDE WHERE POSSISLE MATERIAL THAT ALSO
                            COULD BE USED FOR CIVIC ACTION. HERE HE CITED HELICOPTERS WITH
                            FLEXIBILITY FOR MILITARY ACTION AND CIVILIAN ASSISTANCE, E.G. SEARCH AND
                            RESCUE, MEDICAL EVACUATION, AND DISASTER ASSISTANCE. HE ALSO CITED NEED
                            FOR COMMUNICATION NEWTWORK TO REACH ALL UNITS AND AN ALTERNATE

                            THEY TAKE OVER MY ETAT-JAJOR, I'LL STILL HAVE ONE.”</p>
                        <p>5. STRESSING DESIRE FOR CLOSE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH <gloss

                                >OUFKIR</persName> SAID THAT IN HIS OPINION NON-ALIGNMENT IS NOT A
                            REALISTIC POLICY IN A WORLD DOMINATED BY TWO GREAT POWERS, AND THAT
                            DESPITE IDEAS PREVALENT IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HE THOUGHT IT
                            NECESSARY TD BE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. MOROCCO, HE REITERATED, IS
                            VERY DEFINITELY ON US SIDE. HE NOTED FORMER US SAC BASES WERE
                            DETERIORATING AND ALLUDED TO POSSIBLE US NEED FOR THESE BASES IN CRISIS.
                            IN FURTHER STATEMENT RELATED TO KENITRA, HE DECLARED “AS LONG AS I AM

                            PERSONAL OPINION, MOROCCO SHOULD BE A MEMBER OF ONLY TWO INTERNATIONAL

                            STANDPOINT, HE REGRETFULLY ADDED, IT ALSO NECESSARY TO REMAIN IN ARAB
                            LEAGUE.</p>
                        <p>7. SAYING THAT MOROCCO IS A SMALL PART OF THE FREE WORLD, <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> NOTED THE NEED TO PROTECT ITS
                            TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. WE STRESSED MOROCCO'S POSITION ON THE
                            MEDITERRANEAN, AND EMPHASIZED THE STRATEGIC INTEREST OF THIS POSITION TO
                            US. NOTING STATEMENTS BY SOME PEOPLE THAT MEDITERRANEAN SHOULD BE FOR
                            PEOPLE OF MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES, HE SAID THAT MOROCCO COULD ACT FOR
                            AMERICANS BY ASSUMPTION OF PART OF US NAVY MISSION. USING AS AN EXAMPLE,
                            HE READ FROM MESSAGE HE HAD RECEIVED DURING LUNCH REPORTING PRESENCE OF
                            SOVIET NAVAL VESSELS ANCHORED OFF AL HOCEIMA. HE EMPHASIZED NEED FOR
                            PATROL BOATS, OLD OR NEW, TO PERFORM MISSIONS SUCH AS RECONNAISANCE AND
                            COMMUNICATIONS.</p>
                        <p>8. REVISING MOROCCAN ARMED FORCES' PAST LUKEWARM ATTITUDE TOWARD MUSLO,

                            FOR CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH IT, AND SAID HE WOULD RELY ON MUSLO

                            />PURCHASES. HE MADE NUMEROUS HELPFUL DECISIONS ON SPOT (REPORTED IN
                            SEPTEL).</p>
                        <p>9. COMMENT: WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH OUFKIR SPEAKS FOR KING (WHOM HE DID
                            NOT MENTION DURING CONVERSATION) AND HOW MUCH HE IS FREE-WHEELING, BUT
                            HIS STATEMENTS BEAR OUT EXPECTATION THAT MOROCCAN REGIME WOULD SEEK TO
                            DRAW CLOSER TO US IN AFTERMATH JULY 18 ATTEMPTED COUP (RABAT 3815).
                            BELIEVE WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS OVERTURE. WHILE
                            WE WELCOME OPPORTUNITY INJECT ELEMENT OF RATIONALITY INTO MOROCCAN
                            MILITARY PLANNING, OUFKIR IS NOT MOST POPULAR MAN IN KINGDOM AND WE
                            OBVIOUSLY DO NOT WANT TO GET IN BED WITH HIM. SUGGEST OUR RESPONSES BE
                            CORRECT AND HELPFUL, BUT NOT ENTHUSIASITC.<lb/>GP-4</p>

                        <p>The Secretary welcomed the Prime Minister to Washington. He expressed
                            great pleasure in meeting the Prime Minister for the first time and
                            congratulated him on his new assignment. We were pleased, he said, that
                            things were more stable in Morocco now. The Secretary said he looked
                            back upon his visit to Morocco with great pleasure. It was a visit
                            neither Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> nor he would
                            ever forget.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary and conveyed to him His
                            Majesty's personal greetings. In Morocco, the Prime Minister said, His
                            Majesty and the Moroccan Government have warm recollections of the
                            Secretary's visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were very distressed by the recent
                            difficulties in Morocco. The President, who considered the King a close
                            friend, spoke of him often and had been very worried, and then relieved.
                            We were happy also that the Vice President's visit had gone so well.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d122-02" facs="d122-02"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he had come to Washington primarily to
                            attend the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss> meetings, he being also Minister of Finance, but he
                            had sought this occasion to inform the Secretary personally of the
                            evolution of the situation in Morocco. The events of July 10 had taken
                            them all by surprise. The attempted coup had not been based on any
                            doctrinal or political motives. It had not involved any open or
                            clandestine political organization, nor had it been based on any
                            particular ideology. It had been organized by a few high ranking
                            officers who used their power and influence to take over a school for
                            non-commissioned officers and to stage this abominable action. It had
                            been aimed at everyone, right and left, political parties included, and
                            His Majesty himself. What they would have done subsequently had they
                            succeeded has never been determined but the savagery of their attack did
                            not bode well for the future.</p>
                        <p>Karim-Lamrani said that world press reports had been of serious concern
                            to Morocco. Today one should not say that all was for the best in the
                            best of all possible worlds in Morocco. A great deal of rethinking had
                            to take place regarding the institutions of the state, its economic and
                            financial structure and everything affecting the education, training and
                            employment of the Moroccan man himself. Such is the difficult mandate,
                            the Prime Minister said, which had been given his government. In record
                            time it had the task of straightening out a number of problems in
                            different areas. Its work would be aimed primarily at that large segment
                            of the Moroccan population constituting the “have nots”.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized that it was up to the Moroccans to
                            reorganize themselves, plan their programs, and generate their own
                            material and human requirements. They would need, however, the
                            understanding and help of their friends to achieve even the minimum
                            required. With renewed vigor and earnestness they could reach these
                            goals rapidly, but the popular consensus must continue to support the
                            monarchy and the person of the King. After 13 centuries of monarchy,
                            Morocco is not prepared to accept an overnight change. The Monarchy
                            remains the basis on which necessary programs must be established.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d122-03" facs="d122-03"/>
                        <p>If Moroccans themselves are concerned to bring about a restoration of
                            serenity in Morocco, the Prime Minister went on, the free world must
                            feel the same way. Because of the political and strategic importance of
                            Morocco, of which the United States is well aware, whatever happens in
                            Morocco is bound to have international importance.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Prime Minister said he wished to stress that Morocco
                            had gone to work. It needed understanding, however, and also help to
                            carry out its vast program of economic development. The Prime Minister
                            said he was making his first trip as Prime Minister to Washington
                            because he looked upon the United States as the prime partner of Morocco
                            and the country most capable of understanding Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation for and concurrence in the Prime
                            Minister's remarks. The United States, the Secretary said, attaches
                            great importance to its friendship and close relations with Morocco and
                            shares the Prime Minister's assessment of Morocco's strategic position.
                            The Secretary assured the Prime Minister that the United States would
                            give careful and sympathetic consideration to specific proposals Morocco
                            might wish to make. We feel that relations between our two countries are
                            very good. We want them to remain very good. We are pleased at the
                            approach taken by Morocco in promoting social and economic development
                            which is so essential in the long run to insure the stability of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the problems mentioned by the Prime Minister as facing
                            Morocco, the Secretary said, there was the shortage of natural
                            resources. He said he hoped that Morocco would soon find oil. A second
                            problem, the Secretary continued, derived from the fact that in our
                            modern world the institutions of monarchy were looked upon by some as
                            being anachronistic.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d122-04" facs="d122-04"/>
                        <p>The programs outlined by the Prime Minister were therefore going in the
                            right direction, the Secretary said. They centered upon improving the
                            situation of the people and would give the monarchy greater visibility,
                            thereby compensating for one of the problems of a king. The Secretary
                            noted that the King enjoyed great respect in Morocco as well as
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that the natural resource experts of today
                            were convinced that oil would be found in Morocco. Moreover, the
                            government was developing the mining sector and the agricultural sector.
                            The areas served by new irrigation dams were under development and
                            agrarian reforms were being implemented.</p>
                        <p>As to the compatibility between the Monarchy as an institution and our
                            modern world, the Prime Minister said, whether a nation was a republic
                            or a kingdom, in itself, meant little—what mattered was what was in it.
                            Some monarchies were very democratic as in northern Europe. Some
                            republics were fascist, not to cite any by name, but the socialist
                            republics came to mind. What gave value to a system was the nature of
                            the man leading it. Morocco was fortunate to have a king who was young
                            and modern and close to his people. The Prime Minister concluded that
                            the King must draw even closer to his people. His Majesty needed to be
                            closer to the population at all levels in day to day acts as well as the
                            acts of statesmanship. What mattered most of all was that the steps
                            taken and measures announced be carried out in a healthy climate and
                            with a serious attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister, in conclusion, pointed out that he was no
                            professional politician. He had not sought to be Prime Minister. The job
                            had been thrust upon him. This gave him the right, he said, to impose
                            certain conditions without which no governmental program could be
                            implemented.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation for this opportunity to meet the
                            Prime Minister and to have a frank discussion with him. He stressed the
                            respect His Majesty enjoys in the <pb n="5" xml:id="d122-05"
                                facs="d122-05"/>United States, and specifically referred to
                            President Eisenhower's and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s high regard for the King.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was pleased to see that the Government of Morocco
                            was concerning itself with modernizing the monarchy. Our administration,
                            he said, did not feel that it could give advice to countries about their
                            internal affairs; there had been too much of that in the past. Each
                            country must be guided by its own past and tradition. We want the Prime
                            Minister to know, the Secretary concluded, that the United States fully
                            supports the Moroccan monarchy and its King, and we want to be as
                            helpful to Morocco as we can.</p>

                        <p>1. The following reflects substance from inter-agency consultations with
                            Colonel Rolin, Chief MUSLO, and provides guidance in handling specific
                            requests made by General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                            >Oufkir</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. General Posture: US obviously has significant strategic interest in
                            Morocco deriving from its geographic location. Consequently we wish
                            Morocco to maintain its defensive capability and internal security.
                            Future Moroccan support in Law of the Sea negotiations for free transit
                            through Straits of Gibraltar would be desirable. However, limitations on
                            our resources, desirability of U.S. not becoming too closely identified
                            with regime, and our concern that <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            concentrate its own resources on urgently required economic and social
                            reforms significantly limit extent to which it would either be
                            practicable or <pb n="2" xml:id="d123-02" facs="d123-02"/>desirable for
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to increase its level of
                            military assistance and advisory effort in response to Oufkir's request.
                            At same time, within these limiting parameters and national interest
                            considerations, we wish to be helpful responding to <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> in a manner that will provide
                            additional reassurance that broad lines of US policy toward Morocco will
                            continue. We therefore agreeable to MUSLO taking advantage of new
                            atmosphere to foster closer relations with Moroccan military which we
                            continue regard as focus of significant political power. Under overall
                            guidance of the Ambassador, MUSLO may be as responsive as prudently
                            possible to Moroccan requests for advice and assistance, provided that
                            such advice and assistance does not promise or imply a commitment of
                            additional US resources for Moroccan military establishment.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>'s Requests: The
                            following guidance was provided with respect to handling specific
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> requests <pb n="3"

                        <p>A. Military Orqanization: We regard as politically undesirable formal
                            participation by MUSLO in <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                            >Oufkir</persName>'s review of Moroccan Army, Navy and Air Force
                            organization. Formal MUSLO responsiveness to his request for
                            recommendations re headquarters reorganization and formal MUSLO
                            participation equally undesirable. Foregoing based on fact that we do
                            not rpt not wish to give either Moroccans or French impression that we
                            seeking to enter more central or exclusive relationship with Moroccan
                            military. This should not preclude MUSLO from providing technical and
                            professional advice on specific questions.</p>
                        <p>B. Command and Control System: The assignment of two personnel on a
                            temporary basis to respond to technical questions has already been
                            approved. Since Oufkir apparently places high priority on a Qte
                            coup-proof Unqte command and control system (including an alternate or
                            mobile command post) as a part of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            71 program, we would <pb n="4" xml:id="d123-04" facs="d123-04"/>wish to
                            be responsive in this area. We would not want US personnel assigned in
                            an advisory capacity which might result in their becoming directly
                            involved in operating the Moroccan military comunications network.</p>
                        <p>C. Civic Action: Oufkir appears to be interested in expanding civic
                            action efforts of the Moroccan Army. Advisory assistance relative to
                            civic action may be provided as long as it does not rpt not result in a
                            significant expansion of our military assistance effort.</p>

                                >Oufkir</persName>'s interest in increasing our advisory effort
                            should offer a fertile field for enhancing capability of the MUSLO. We
                            prepared consider substitutions in MUSLO personnel and even small
                            increases if benefit is likely to outweigh cost or political

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Good Afternoon, Your
                            Majesty. I have disturbed you this afternoon to present to you my views
                            on a subject that I consider to be of the greatest importance, the vote
                            in the United Nations on Chinese representation, which will occur on
                            Tuesday. As you know, since we had the opportunity to meet in 1957, I
                            have always had the very greatest respect for you and also for the
                            independence and integrity of your country. And because I cherish our
                            personal relationship, I want to speak to you in the frankest terms
                            about this important issue. It is my conviction that the removal of an
                            honorable member of the United Nations by a simple majority vote would
                            be a precedent of the most disastrous consequences. It could have the
                            most serious implications for the future survival of this organization.
                            And for this reason, I would ask you to consider voting with the United
                            States in favor of making the issue of expelling the government of
                            Taiwan an “important question” and at the same time to support the
                            position in establishing this matter as one of priority during Tuesday's
                            deliberation. I believe this is in the interest of the United Nations in
                            the future, because if any member can be expelled at any time by a
                            simple majority vote, this could unravel the organization in years to
                            come. And if if you could find it possible to vote with the United
                            States on this issue alone, that is of the “important question,” I would
                            consider it a very great personal favor. And I look forward, Your
                            Majesty, to our meeting again at some time. I know we have planned it,
                            but events have intervened, and I — Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and I look forward to welcoming Your Majesty at a

                            matter again this afternoon with my government. I want you to tell the
                            President that I fully understand the concern of the United States. I
                            want you to tell the President that I am deeply touched that he has
                            called me personally. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>:

                            and prosperity, and I will not fail to send you a message regarding our

                        <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>A. Morocco is a poor country with a medieval monarchy facing growing
                            pressures for political, economic, and social change. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan II</persName>, who was nearly overthrown in
                            a military uprising in July 1971, has learned little from his narrow
                            escape. He still believes that he can continue to rule in the style of
                            an oriental potentate. This virtually assures that other challenges to
                            the King will take place, but <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is in a strong position and could carry on for
                            many years.</p>
                        <p>B. There is only a slight possibility that <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> will shift course and gradually reduce his own
                            political role. Even such a posture would not guarantee a decrease in
                            political tension. Indeed, there is no assurance that the civilian
                            opposition would cooperate with the King. The relaxation of royal
                            authority might add to the uncertainties and whet politicians' appetites
                            for further power.</p>
                        <p>C. The military establishment is both the chief prop of and potential
                            threat to the crown. Thus far, General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >Oufkir</persName>, who has firm control of the armed forces, has
                            shown no inclination to move against the King. He would be tempted to
                            step in, however, if <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            seemed to be fumbling badly in handling the problems of government. The
                            odds in favor of a move by lower ranking officers, who seem more
                            concerned with the need for basic change in society, are likely to grow
                            over time. We do not have, however, any concrete evidence of plotting
                            against the King in the Moroccan armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d125-03" facs="d125-03"/>
                        <p>D. The regime is not likely to deal effectively with its growing economic
                            and social problems, but these do not pose an immediate threat. Over the
                            longer run, the failure to make basic agricultural and social reforms
                            will promote the radicalization of the Moroccan political scene.</p>
                        <p>E. In foreign policy, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is
                            principally concerned with improving relations with the other states of
                            the Maghreb and with boosting his stature among African and Islamic
                            nations. While he does not want to antagonize the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, he desires friendly relations with
                            the West in general and France and the US in particular. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> sees value in continued US
                            operation of the Kenitra communications complex, but his will to
                            preserve present arrangements would weaken if he judged their value to
                            him was waning and if popular pressure mounted, say in the event of a
                            major round of fighting between Arabs and Israel. The close relationship
                            between the US and Morocco would be called into question if the monarchy
                            were overthrown.</p>

                        <p>DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>1. Morocco is a basically conservative and traditional state in which
                            there are increasingly ominous rumblings of change. Its uneven exposure
                            to European ideas and ways has left it a mixture of the traditional and
                            the contemporary. Since the end of the French and Spanish Protectorates
                            in 1956, it has made little progress in developing modern political,
                            economic, and social institutions. The legacy of the French policy of
                            divide and rule, accentuating the differences between the Berbers of the
                            mountains and the Arabized population of the towns and lowlands, has
                            played its part.* But even more significant have been the effects of the
                            sharply segmented, still partly feudal, Moroccan social system in which
                            power and authority are widely diffused among competing individuals and
                            factions. Though the tribal structure has weakened among the Arabized
                            population, the traditional system still strongly influences political
                            alignments and discourages the rise of effective national parties. Only
                            the monarchy provides cohesion, combining as it does both political and
                            religious authority and attracting the loyalty of both Arab and
                            Berber.</p>
                        <p>* The Moroccan population is overwhelmingly Berber in origin, and the
                            majority of those who now call themselves Arabs are really Arabized
                            Berbers. Those who are termed Berbers—roughly 25 percent of the
                            population—are so called because of their adherence to Berber speech and
                            folkways.</p>
                        <p>2. The Moroccan system, despite its conservative character, has elements
                            of flexibility and resilience. It is based on personal relationships and
                            loyalties rather than on law. And serious confrontation is avoided by
                            opening back doors when the front doors close. It is ruled by and for a
                            small Arabized elite around King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan
                                II</persName>. Corruption and favoritism are an inevitable component
                            of the system and touch the lives and politics of most prominent and
                            powerful people in Morocco, including the royal family and hangers-on at
                            court. Within broad limits this is considered normal by most Moroccans,
                            and the small politically conscious minority of the population becomes
                            concerned only if corruption and personal influence exceed customary
                            bounds. Many in this minority also become concerned when the King shows
                            signs of losing control. It is precisely for these reasons that
                            discontent has been rising in recent years in Morocco.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d125-05" facs="d125-05"/>
                        <p>3. This whole structure was nearly toppled in July 1971 by a military
                            uprising. At that time, a nucleus of middle grade officers, joined by
                            some of the senior generals, seized and held the King briefly. Their
                            coup quickly collapsed because of failures in planning and leadership,
                            disunity among the conspirators, loyalty to the King in the armed
                            forces, and bad luck. The alleged conspirators were promptly put to
                            death—which may serve as a deterrent to future attempts or may merely
                            cause future conspirators to plan more carefully. But the attempt
                            indicated that pressures for change were mounting, and it called into
                            question the durability of the traditional system in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>I. THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER</p>
                        <p>A. The Monarchy</p>
                        <p>4. The centuries old Alaouite Dynasty is the central political
                            institution in Morocco. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s father, who had been deposed, returned to the
                            throne just before the French Protectorate ended in 1956 and
                            consolidated the royal power. Since acceding to the throne in 1961,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has gone even further
                            than his father in asserting the supremacy of the monarchy. When bloody
                            riots broke out in Casablanca in 1965, he prorogued parliament and
                            virtually suspended political activity. But after five years of a “state
                            of exception,” he felt it expedient to regularize the regime. He drew up
                            a constitution in 1970, confirming royal authority over all facets of
                            the government and providing some illusion of popular participation in
                            government.</p>
                        <p>5. Following the 1971 coup attempt, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> promulgated a new constitution. This document,
                            though slightly more liberal than its predecessor, confirms the King's
                            prerogative to make and unmake governments and to rule by decree if he
                            deems necessary. While the civilian politicians bitterly criticized the
                            unilateral proclamation of this instrument by the King before
                            negotiations on the role of the civilian parties in the government had
                            been concluded, they recognize their inability to mount a successful
                            open challenge to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and
                            concede the King's primacy—at least for the present.</p>
                        <p>6. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, now 43, is a
                            skillful political manipulator, who has sought to bolster the loyalty of
                            the military establishment to the throne and has greatly reduced the
                            influence of civilian politicians. On the one hand he has attempted to
                            prevent the formation of groups powerful enough to threaten his
                            position, and on the other has made skillful use of patronage and the
                            desire for office that animates Moroccan politicians in general. He has
                            made office the gateway to riches, not political power, and his
                            pandering to the acquisitiveness of the elite has aggravated the problem
                            of corruption. Another source of discontent is his luxurious style of
                            living which is considered inappropriate by both traditionalists and
                            modernists.</p>
                        <p>7. Characteristically, <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            reacted firmly to opposition when he thought it could be overcome or,
                            when faced by broader pressure, by a pretense of concession. Thus soon
                            after the suppression of the attempted military coup of last July he
                            acknowledged the need for popular participation in the governing
                            process. This stance, however, has turned out to have been mainly a
                            device to buy time. In his subsequent dealings with the
                            politicians—consulting, but in the end facing them with faits
                                accompli—<persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has clearly
                            demonstrated that he does not want to share power nor to act as a
                            constitutional monarch. His actions over the past 10 months lead us to
                            judge that he believes it possible to continue the traditional system of
                            royal rule without meaningful concessions to the political parties.</p>
                        <p>8. Though he has obvious political skills, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> does not concentrate his whole attention on
                            governing. Not even the uprising of <pb n="6" xml:id="d125-06"
                                facs="d125-06"/>July 1971 changed his preoccupation with the pursuit
                            of pleasure. His expenditures of time and money on golf are legendary in
                            Morocco as are the pomp and circumstance of royal travel. Moreover, he
                            is autocratic and not disposed to take advice from others. Further,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is erratic and
                            changeable, acting on the spur of the moment and frequently reversing
                            direction. The shock of his near deposition last July seems only to have
                            accentuated this tendency. In short, he appears to have learned little
                            from the attempted coup.</p>
                        <p>B. The Political Parties</p>
                        <p>9. The Istiqlal Party played the major role in bringing an end to the
                            Protectorates in 1956, but the political parties today lack the strength
                            to force the King to deal with them. In part, their weakness stems from
                            the inability of the politicians to pull together. After independence
                            this factionalism led the left wing of the Istiqlal to split off to form
                            the National Union of Popular Forces (UNFP). Other minor groupings also
                            arose, including the Popular Movement, which was inspired by the Palace
                            as a counterweight to the Istiqlal and has cooperated closely with the
                            monarchy. Thanks to this disunity and rivalry, the civilian politicians
                            found themselves unable to contest the assumption of supreme power by
                            the monarch. The party leaders never effectively controlled the Cabinet,
                            even during the first few years after independence when they were
                            nominally part of the governmental coalition. And their organizations
                            have been further weakened, demoralized, and disrupted by their
                            exclusion from normal political activity since 1965.</p>
                        <p>10. The party leaders themselves have contributed to the growth of
                            factionalism. The head of the more conservative Istiqlal Party, Allal
                            al-Fassi, a traditional Arab leader from the city of Fez, has been
                            willing to engage in private discussions with the King and with leaders
                            of other parties, but he is rigidly insistent that his party should have
                            the dominant position. His generally uncompromising stand and elitist
                            approach have undermined cooperative efforts among the politicians. He
                            has just suffered a heart attack and may have to curtail his activity.
                            This may make him all the less willing to see his political rivals in
                            the UNFP play a major role in directing opposition to the King.</p>
                        <p>11. The UNFP leaders, Abderrahim Bouabid and Abdallah Ibrahim, are
                            somewhat more flexible in their approach. Despite their differences with
                            the Istiqlal and the rather imperious al-Fassi, they agreed in 1970 to
                            patch together a so-called National Front of the two parties in order
                            better to face the King with the appearance of unity. This effort has
                            not been very successful. The rival parties continue to pull in
                            different directions in their negotiations with the King. And even
                            though the UNFP views the monarchy as basically a medieval institution
                            which should be stripped of its dominant power, the party's leaders in
                            talks with the King have been more conciliatory than their counterparts
                            in the Istiqlal. Recognizing their party's weakness, Bouabid and
                                <persName corresp="#p_EMI1">Ibrahim</persName> have persevered in
                            trying to keep contact with <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> even after his unilateral postponement of
                            elections demonstrated his contempt for these conversations.</p>
                        <p>12. The troubles of the parties also stem from their limited
                            constituencies and poor image. Neither party has a mass base or a
                            nation-wide following. In the 1963 elections the Istiqlal got about 30
                            and the UNFP about 22 percent of the vote; their popular backing has no
                            doubt decreased in the interim. The Istiqlal appeals to the traditional
                            Arab mercantile and land-owning elite, particularly around Fez, though
                            it also has some support from Arabized elements in rural areas. The UNFP
                            is basically an urban party, backed by <pb n="7" xml:id="d125-07"
                                facs="d125-07"/>segments of the middle class, educated youth (whose
                            number is increasing), and organized labor.</p>
                        <p>13. The major labor organization, the Moroccan Federation of Labor (UMT),
                            with several hundred thousand members is closely allied to the UNFP but
                            independent of it. Led by the charismatic and politically active Mahjoub
                            Ben Seddik, the UMT has the capability to provoke serious disorders,
                            particularly when allied with disaffected students. UMT leadership,
                            which at times has had difficulties imposing discipline on certain
                            locals, has recently been reshuffled to make room for younger and more
                            militant cadres.</p>
                        <p>C. The Military</p>
                        <p>14. The 60,000-man military establishment is both the chief prop of and
                            potential threat to the crown. In fact, the cadets who took part in the
                            July uprising thought that they were protecting the King. Particularly
                            since a number of officers of questionable loyalty were killed or
                            removed as a result of the coup attempt, the remaining senior officers
                            are generally conservative and monarchist in outlook. We know little
                            about the attitudes and intentions of the officer corps as a whole,
                            however. Broadly speaking, the armed forces do not conceive of the
                            military establishment as an independent political force.</p>
                        <p>15. The uprising of last July was the first attack against the throne
                            since independence. It stemmed in part from the revulsion of a few
                            officers against the corruption rampant in the regime. This was
                            particularly true of General <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >Medbouh</persName>, who joined a group of middle grade officers who
                            had taken the initiative in planning the coup attempt. Despite the
                            King's subsequent purge of elements suspected of disloyalty, there are
                            reports that some officers remain concerned over the continuing
                            corruption in high places. Moreover, the purge may itself have created
                            resentment among the junior officers. There are also signs that some
                            officers are disturbed by the King's fitful attention to the business of
                            governing and by the unsteady course of his relations with the civilian
                            politicians. We do not have, however, any concrete evidence of plotting
                            against the King in the Moroccan armed forces.</p>
                        <p>16. The Moroccan military establishment is distinguished by the high
                            percentage of Berbers in its senior ranks. During the Protectorate, the
                            French consciously encouraged Berbers to enter the military profession
                            as a counterweight to the Arabized majority which dominated the
                            political scene. Since independence there have been no visible signs of
                            significant ethnic rivalry within the military. But in Moroccan society
                            at large many Berbers resent the favored position of the Arabs from Fez
                            in the economic and administrative sectors. The army leaders continue to
                            favor Berber officers, and Berber clannishness could become a more
                            important factor in the attitudes of the officer corps.</p>
                        <p>17. The present leader of the military establishment, General Mohamed
                            Oufkir, is unquestionably the most important figure in the country after
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> is a Berber whose power is based
                            not only on his closeness to the King, but on his longtime control of
                            the internal security, police, and intelligence networks. An outstanding
                            administrator, he is also widely feared for his tough and frequently
                            brutal treatment of his opponents. (He is widely believed to have been
                            responsible for the kidnapping and murder of leftist Moroccan opposition
                            leader Medhi Ben Barka in 1965.) Long relied on by the King, <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> further strengthened his
                            position after the July 1971 uprising when he was given unlimited powers
                            to restore public order. He now serves as the commander of the Royal
                            Armed Forces and Minister of National Defense.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d125-08" facs="d125-08"/>
                        <p>18. Despite his years in the public eye, the 52-year old <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> has remained a figure of some
                            mystery. He is conservative, bent on maintaining order, and is
                            contemptuous of the civilian politicians. In the past he has shown
                            sympathy for efforts to strengthen the authority of the monarchy. But
                            since July 1971 his attitudes toward the regime have seemed less clear.
                            There is speculation among the officer corps that <persName
                                corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> may be having second thoughts
                            about <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. He is apparently
                            attempting in low key to persuade the King to change his life-style, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> does not seem to be
                            encouraging <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> to make basic
                            reforms. <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> himself
                            apparently does not believe that fundamental alterations in the systems
                            are necessary or wise, partly because such changes might threaten
                            his—and the military establishment's—position.</p>
                        <p>II. PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS</p>
                        <p>A. Economic Development and Social Change</p>
                        <p>19. The interplay of political forces goes on against the background of
                            increasingly serious economic and social problems. The country is
                            independent, largely self-sufficient, and has fairly flourishing trade.
                            It is not embroiled in conflict with its neighbors. But it has many of
                            the familiar ills of developing states: a wide gap between rich and
                            poor, massive unemployment and underemployment, very rapid population
                            growth, disaffected students and an embittered younger urban generation,
                            an ineffective and insufficient educational system, and a self-centered
                            and greedy elite. Morocco exports over $100 million worth of phosphates
                            annually, but it lacks oil or other resources likely to provide the
                            revenues needed for rapid development.</p>
                        <p>20. The Moroccan economy has not recorded an impressive performance since
                            independence. It lags far behind neighboring oil-rich Algeria in almost
                            all indices of economic growth. Indeed, until 1967 gross national
                            product increased little faster than population growth. Moreover, the
                            country passed through inflation and recession which depressed economic
                            activity significantly. In the past few years, however, the government
                            has been somewhat more successful. It increased investment in irrigation
                            facilities, modernized phosphate mines, and improved the efficiency of
                            tax collection. Incentives to private investment have also had effect,
                            and balance-of-payments surpluses have led to relaxation of foreign
                            exchange and tariff regulations. Morocco has shown a growth rate of
                            about 5.5 percent between 1968-1972, a favorable foreign exchange
                            situation, increased earnings from tourism, and bumper harvests. Though
                            the July uprising added uncertainties, some of the strains in the
                            economy have been relieved. And the prospects for growth in the small
                            modern industrial and agricultural sectors are good.</p>
                        <p>21. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> talks of the need
                            for social and economic development, but thus far has not made a
                            determined effort to attack the problems of the traditional sector of
                            the economy. Important in his thinking is the risk of unhinging the
                            political and social structure of the agricultural sector, which
                            sustains most of the population and contributes significantly to overall
                            economic activity. There has been some investment in dams and irrigation
                            facilities, but this is only beginning to show results. Agriculture thus
                            remains largely dependent on rainfall which is capricious. Droughts have
                            been frequent and productivity has increased very slowly. More
                            important, the King has not encouraged efforts to change landholding
                            patterns and the organization of the rural sector as demanded by the
                            National Front. As long as <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            fails to promote reform <pb n="9" xml:id="d125-09" facs="d125-09"/>of
                            the agrarian sector, Morocco's prospects for greater economic progress
                            will remain dim.</p>
                        <p>22. These political constraints on development are not likely to be soon
                            overcome. The present government is unprepared to take bold initiatives
                            in economic and social realms. In fact, the nature and execution of
                            reform is a major point of dispute between the King and the political
                            parties, who call for such steps as agrarian reform and nationalization
                            of the key sectors of the economy. Even if the National Front were to
                            gain control of parliament following elections, the party leaders
                            themselves would find it hard to agree on concrete programs. Under the
                            best of circumstances, it would be difficult to carry out radical land
                            reform and to modernize traditional agriculture practices. Reform of the
                            French-style educational system is also needed, but the present regime
                            is not disposed to make more than minimal changes. Any government would
                            find it both expensive and difficult to modernize Morocco's schools.</p>
                        <p>23. Basic economic and social problems do not pose an immediate threat to
                            the regime. The peasantry is politically inert and most of those who are
                            the most economically disadvantaged have the least political power and
                            initiative. It is not easy to mobilize the rural elements for political
                            ends even with appeals to economic self-interest. Besides, the peasants
                            are so steeped in the traditional mold that they do not generally blame
                            the regime for their poverty. For their part, the political party
                            leaders, perhaps because they recognize that rousing the peasantry is
                            dangerous for them, are not attempting to foment rural discontent.</p>
                        <p>24. But the traditional social order is slowly giving way before the
                            forces of change. The growing exodus from the farms is creating ever
                            larger concentrations of migrants who maintain a precarious existence in
                            slums on the outskirts of the cities, in effect living between the
                            traditional and modern sectors of society. Education is gradually
                            enlarging the ranks of aspirants to the ruling elite. But denied
                            political power and often without satisfactory jobs, these people become
                            potential dissidents. The younger urban generation is coming
                            increasingly to believe that the continuation of the monarchy is
                            incompatible with social and economic progress. All this contributes to
                            an ever expanding reservoir of discontent.</p>
                        <p>25. Over the long run, this process poses a potent challenge to the
                            Moroccan Government. Up to now, the voices calling for a complete
                            restructuring of the system have been few; most advocates of this view
                            have found it necessary to go into exile. But student unrest is growing,
                            and the tiny Party of Liberation and Socialism (which is the Moroccan
                            Communist Party) is seeking a broader role, although to date its
                            activities have been well circumscribed by the security forces. The
                            King's immobility on the matter of reform will no doubt encourage the
                            growth of opposition. It will be some time, however, before challenges
                            from this quarter could seriously tax the capacity of the regime to keep
                            order. But clearly continuing failure to enact reforms would promote an
                            eventual radicalization of the Moroccan political scene.</p>
                        <p>B. The Political Outlook</p>
                        <p>26. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s monopoly of political
                            power brings him into direct conflict with the civilian politicians. The
                            new constitution clearly represents less than they had hoped to achieve.
                            In an effort to press <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>,
                            they announced a boycott of the referendum to approve it, though they
                            did not actively marshal their followers to abstain nor did they
                            repudiate the new constitution once promulgated. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s postponement of elections also
                            disappointed some, although there are signs that the Istiqlal <pb n="10"
                                xml:id="d125-10" facs="d125-10"/>was not unhappy with the prospect
                            of additional time in which to organize. But particularly if the King
                            postpones new parliamentary elections beyond 1973, the temper of the
                            opposition seems certain to rise. Already the leadership of the UNFP
                            faces pressure from its rank-and-file members not to acquiesce in
                            concessions to the King. And general disillusionment over his failure to
                            change his ways after the July uprising is growing. Thus the civilian
                            parties—whether in concert or separately—are likely to increase their
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>27. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, however, is not
                            impressed by the political parties or their leaders. Hence, the odds are
                            that he will continue much in the pattern of the past, holding the reins
                            himself and turning to repression if need be. He clearly prefers to rule
                            through a non-party government, like the present one, which is entirely
                            subservient to his will. He may refuse to allow elections on one pretext
                            or another or he may rig the results to favor his hand-picked candidates
                            to deny the franchise significant meaning. At the same time, he might
                            feel it expedient to leave hope alive that one day he would relax
                            control in order to lure the political parties to remain within the
                            system, and he will make gestures intended to assuage the opposition's
                            frustrations.</p>
                        <p>28. This course entails risks. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> shows no signs of providing dynamic leadership;
                            his personal habits militate against success in providing the efficient
                            and capable rule required to keep the present system functioning
                            smoothly over the longer run. If he embarked on a course utilizing even
                            more repression, discontent would be likely to focus increasingly on the
                            monarchy. In this event, it is difficult to predict how long <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> could remain master of the
                            situation, though given luck, he might be able to carry on for many
                            years. But Moroccan politics would be tense and it is likely that other
                            challenges to the King would be made.</p>
                        <p>29. There is, of course, a slight possibility that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will recognize this danger,
                            change his ways, allow parliament to be elected and function freely, and
                            gradually reduce his obvious political role. Even this conciliatory
                            posture would not guarantee a decrease in political tension. Indeed,
                            there is no assurance that the civilian opposition would cooperate with
                            the King. The relaxation of royal authority might add to the
                            uncertainties and whet politicians' appetites for further power. It
                            could therefore lead to louder and more articulate demands by civilian
                            political leaders. But the opposition is aware of the risks in
                            challenging the King this directly and is thus likely to be moderate in
                            its demands for some time. Hence, this course offers some possibility of
                            transition to a more broadly based regime without passing through a
                            revolutionary stage.</p>
                        <p>30. In any event, maintaining the loyalty of the military is the key to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s success. Thus far,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> and his senior
                            associates have shown no inclination to take over the government—and
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> had every opportunity
                            to do so in the wake of the unsuccessful coup last July. He would be
                            tempted to step in, however, if <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> seemed to be fumbling badly in handling the
                            problems of government. Indeed, the King's lengthy consultations with
                            the politicians have already raised within the military both fears that
                            he might surrender too much and concern at his image of impotence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>, with a firm grip on
                            the military establishment, would stand an excellent chance of success,
                            should he decide to depose <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                            >Hassan</persName>. His chances would be considerably better than those
                            of the officers whose effort miscarried last July, for he could use
                            regular command channels. Moreover, he is the most able general
                            remaining in the armed forces. <pb n="11" xml:id="d125-11"
                                facs="d125-11"/>Moves against the King by lower ranking officers
                            would be unlikely to succeed while Oufkir is on the scene. His recent
                            purge has complicated the task of plotters within the armed forces as
                            well as increasing the reliability of the officer corps.</p>
                        <p>31. Over time, however, the odds in favor of a military coup are likely
                            to grow. The younger officers are better educated than their superiors
                            and appear more concerned with the need for basic change in society.
                            Further, they are exposed to the example of revolutionary regimes,
                            especially in Algeria, and to the cumulative impact of antimonarchical
                            sentiment elsewhere in the Arab world. In the long run, therefore, the
                            gradual modernization of the officer corps seems destined to make the
                            military establishment a less reliable prop for the monarchy. And
                            eventually a significant proportion of the officers may come to
                            subscribe to the dissatisfaction with Hassan now prevalent among younger
                            urban civilians.</p>
                        <p>32. If a successor regime were led by General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >Oufkir</persName> or one of his senior associates, such as General
                            Driss Ben Aomar, it would not necessarily be antimonarchical in outlook.
                            Depending on the circumstances that brought it to power, it might
                            institute a regency for the nine-year old Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed,
                            and continue much in the vein of King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>, but with far more sustained attention to the
                            problems of government. A regime dominated by the younger officers would
                            be strongly opposed to retaining any remnants of the monarchy and would
                            perhaps resemble the government in Algeria. Nationalist in orientation
                            and focused inward on Morocco's domestic problems, it would be likely to
                            promote rapid social change and measures to produce a more equitable
                            distribution of income. But the disappearance of the monarchy would also
                            promote a revival of regionalist forces.</p>
                        <p>III. FOREIGN RELATIONS</p>
                        <p>33. The King, who is by and large the master of Morocco's foreign policy,
                            has limited international aspirations. He is mainly concerned with his
                            neighbors in the MAGHREB and to a lesser extent with recognition by
                            African and Islamic nations as a leader. (He is host of an <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> summit meeting being held in June 1972
                            and was elected its chairman.) He has backed down from the territorial
                            demands espoused by his father and is seeking an amicable resolution of
                            Morocco's border dispute with Algeria. Libya's verbal support for the
                            Moroccan insurgents last July has seriously strained Moroccan-Libyan
                            relations, producing reciprocal propaganda attacks and mutual suspicions
                            of subversion. And <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            desire to remain detached from the Arab-Israeli issue conflicts with his
                            wish to be accepted as an Arab leader.</p>
                        <p>34. Dealings with the Great Powers are also troublesome for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. He wants friendly relations
                            with the West in general and the US and France in particular. But at the
                            same time, he does not want to antagonize the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Though he is suspicious of Soviet naval activity in
                            the Mediterranean and fears that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has aims to acquire hegemony in North Africa, he makes
                            an effort to appear evenhanded. Hence, he permits some Soviet vessels to
                            call at Moroccan ports and high Moroccan officials exchange visits with
                            their Soviet counterparts. He has also concluded several significant
                            economic deals with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for
                            projects such as electrical generating plants and irrigation
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>35. The US has been closely associated with the Moroccan monarchy over
                            the years. US military and economic aid have been relatively large
                            (about $860 million since independence of which some $77 million is
                            military and about $783 million economic). Moreover, inside Morocco the
                            US is widely regarded as a <pb n="12" xml:id="d125-12" facs="d125-12"
                            />staunch supporter of the royal regime. Despite domestic criticism,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, for his part, has
                            permitted the US to operate the important Kenitra communications
                            complex. And he is not eager to see this relationship disturbed.</p>
                        <p>36. But forces that threaten cooperation with the US are rising. As
                            elsewhere in Africa and Asia, nationalist feeling is growing in Morocco.
                            This process would no doubt be speeded if party politics and political
                            campaigning are permitted as provided by the constitution. Both the UNFP
                            and the Istiqlal stand for US withdrawal from the Kenitra facilities,
                            and would be tempted to raise this issue on occasion to garner
                            additional popular support. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> still sees value in retaining this link to the US
                            and uses it as an inducement for additional military aid. However, he
                            may interpret present US plans to reduce the complement at the Kenitra
                            complex as an indication that it is a waning asset for him. These
                            calculations would weaken his will to preserve the arrangement if
                            popular pressure against the American presence were to mount, say in the
                            event of a major round of fighting between Arabs and Israel.</p>
                        <p>37. The close relationship between the US and Morocco could be far more
                            seriously disrupted if the monarchy were to be overthrown. A
                            conservative military regime would try to maintain close ties with the
                            US. But even such a regime would be influenced by pressures of
                            nationalist sentiment. A radical regime would almost certainly adopt a
                            hostile stance to the US, and could be expected to terminate US access
                            to the Kenitra facilities.</p>

                            UNTRUSTWORTHY</p>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The attempt on August 16 by pilots of the Moroccan F-5 fighter squadron
                            to kill King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> brings into
                            question the loyalty of the Moroccan military. This loyalty is the key
                            to the durability of <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s
                            regime, particularly in view of his failure in recent months to broaden
                            his power base by bringing the political opposition into the government.
                            Since the abortive coup at Skhirat in 1971, the King has demonstrated
                            that he is interested only in cosmetic reforms and that he has no
                            intention to share power in a meaningful way. He appeared content to let
                            his power rest on the narrow base of the military establishment, and
                            seemed sufficiently confident of Defense Minister General Mohamed
                            Oufkir's control to leave on an extended vacation to France at the end
                            of July.</p>
                        <p>Demise of <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>. The apparent
                            suicide of General <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> in the
                            early hours of August 17 removes an irreplaceable pillar of support.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>'s total devotion to
                            the monarchy was important because he was both ruthless and well
                            organized, traits which enabled him to command respect from and inspire
                            awe in the military establishment. He supposedly lived by a severe code
                            of honor which had once led him to threaten suicide should the <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d127-02" facs="d127-02"/>King lose faith in him. His
                            replacement, General Driss Ben Aomar, while a loyal and respected
                            officer (an ex-Chief of Staff) is not in good health and does not have
                            the presence of <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName>. He is not
                            likely to be able to mend rifts within the military that may result from
                            this latest attempt to overthrow <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Internal Outlook. The King now faces the task of again purging the
                            military, which has shown itself untrustworthy twice in the past 13
                            months. To gain time and contemplate future maneuvers, if the King
                            remains true to form, he will attempt to reopen a dialogue with the
                            political opposition. He may be expected to downplay the attempted
                            assassination as an isolated incident and create an atmosphere of
                            dialogue and reform. Past experience, however, does not suggest that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will change his
                            personalized style of government based on a traditional web of
                            patron-client relationships.</p>
                        <p>International Implications. The latest attempt came just as <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> was recovering his international
                            stature as a result of his adroit handling of the Rabat <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Summit and his election as <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> President in June. He now stands to
                            have his prestige slip again, particularly if he finds it necessary to
                            devote all his energy to stabilizing his domestic scene. He may be
                            inclined, however, to exploit his role as <gloss target="#t_OAU1"
                                >OAU</gloss> President to try recovering international status as
                            well as to draw attention at home away from a confused situation.</p>
                        <p>Neighboring Tunisia, Mauritania and possibly Algeria—despite <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>'s dislike of monarchy—will
                            probably be relieved that Morocco has been spared, at least for the
                            moment, the chaos that would have resulted had the coup been successful.
                            The hostile Libyan radio, on the other hand, lost no time in lauding the
                            attempt on the King and calling for other efforts.</p>

                        <p>US Linked to Plot. Moroccan officials have already alluded to US
                            involvement because the pilots operated from Kenitra, where we have
                            recently reduced our presence. We have strongly denied any role. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> probably feels any
                            such charges groundless, he nonetheless might believe that such a
                            popular attitude would warrant a reduction or change in the US military
                            presence; this would also serve him well in negotiations be may
                            undertake with the political opposition, which opposes any US military
                            presence in Morocco.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The recent attempted coup in Morocco and the uncertain future facing the
                            regime lead me to believe that we should consider ways of reducing the
                            level of our military involvement and dependence on the Moroccan
                            communications facilities.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that some of our activities and military presence is directly
                            associated with the oral agreement with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> in 1963 concerning base management and
                            telecommunications training. I believe, however, that we should make
                            every effort, consistent with that agreement, to shift the actual
                            operating functions of the RMAF base at Kenitra to Moroccans,
                            restricting US personnel to advisory roles. I also recognize that any
                            precipitous withdrawal of personnel involved in training and base
                            operations might adversely affect our continued use of the US Navy
                            communications facilities, and that, therefore, any reductions in
                            presence would have to be done on a gradual basis.</p>
                        <p>I would like you to examine this situation and submit recommendations to
                            me on ways we can reduce our involvement by turning over to the
                            Moroccans as many of the operations and maintenance functions as
                            possible at the RMAF base at Kenitra, with US personnel, if necessary,
                            continuing to serve as advisors. I would also like you to examine the
                            impact of the Fleet Satellite Communications System on our continued
                            need for the communications sites at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel and the
                            desirability of reorienting these facilities by remote-keying (one of
                            the options in the 1971 <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> contingency
                            relocation plan), retaining the use of the Moroccan frequencies but
                            reducing our overall presence in Morocco, and how quickly this could be
                            accomplished. This evaluation should identify costs, personnel and any
                            anticipated degradation of capabilities. I understand the Navy has
                            already initiated studies and actions that could be helpful in
                            determining ways to reduce our dependence on the Moroccan-based
                            communications facilities.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate this information and your recommendations by September
                            23.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to assess the situation in Morocco
                            following the abortive coup attempt of August 16, to examine the level
                            of US military involvement and to propose certain interim actions you
                            may wish to consider toward reorienting our military posture there.</p>

                        <p>The situatation is outwardly calm but more ominous and ominous toward
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s longevity than after
                            last year's attempted coup. Few believe any longer that required reforms
                            are likely to be made, and the military's loyalty to the regime is more
                            suspect than ever.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> OUKFIR's complicity and alleged
                            suicide, the inept (if not poorly conceived) assassination attempt by
                            the F-5 squadron, the King's chastisement and usurpation of direct
                            control of the military and prospects of yet another purge of the
                            officer staff, has completely shattered the military's morale. The
                            military was the main prop of the regime. OUKFIR was the most qualified
                            leader considered capable of maintaining the military's cohesiveness and
                            loyalty. His adventure against <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> probably reflected his growing awareness of his
                            own pre-eminent personal authority among the military and belief that
                            the King could not or would not alter the regime's style. OUKFIR was
                            among the diminishing few who spoke frankly to the King about the
                            regime's shortcomings, and their relationship appeared to be under
                            increasing tension in recent months. While there is still much
                            monarchist sentiment among the poorer classes, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s lavish life style, widespread
                            official corruption, critical unemployment, prospects of increased
                            autocratic rule and military disaffection are likely to accelerate the
                            process of the regime's disintegration.</p>
                        <p>With the demise of Oukfir and his almost embarassingly demonstrative
                            pro-US attitudes and apparent desire to maintain the monarchical
                            structure under his own regency, the next coup attempt is more likely to
                            be radical <pb n="3" xml:id="d128-03" facs="d128-03"/>and republican in
                            nature and not as favorably disposed to the US. The chance of our being
                            able to hang on to our naval communications station under such
                            circumstances, coupled with the new regime's likely propensity to look
                            for ways to rally domestic support and establish its Arab legitimacy,
                            would be greatly diminished. In the short run, however, while <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> rules, our Ambassador believes,
                            and we agree, that there may be some opinion favoring our withdrawal
                            from Kenitra but that the King is more likely to want to retain our
                            presence as a gauge of our<lb/>continued support for the regime.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Military Involvement</p>
                        <p>We have about 1350 <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> personnel (mostly
                            Navy and Marine) and 1500 dependents located in Morocco at the Kenitra
                            complex that includes the Moroccan air facility (597 US personnel) and
                            two outlying communications sites at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel (647 US
                            personnel). The Navy communications station serves as the master station
                            for the area, controlling and coordinating all ship-to-shore
                            communications with US Naval forces operating in the Mediterranean. We
                            also have a 25-man <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, including a
                            five-man F-5 augmentation team at the airstrip, associated with a small
                            grant <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> training program (about $0.8
                            million a year) and a credit sales program (about $15 million a
                            year).</p>
                        <p>Our presence in Morocco was covered by an oral understanding between
                            President <persName>Kennedy</persName> and King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in 1963, when it was agreed that
                            we could continue to utilize the communications facilities in exchange
                            for our (i) putting Kenitra under Moroccan command, (ii) maintaining the
                            same level of operational expenditures ($2.1 million) and (iii) training
                            Moroccans in base management and telecommunications. (The sites of the
                            US communications facilities at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel were not
                            “Moroccanized.”)</p>
                        <p>This week, after the Moroccan Government's initial indication that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was suspected of complicity in
                            OUKFIR's attempted coup (apparently because of the impression that the
                            US F-5 advisors and Navy personnel at the airstrip must have assisted in
                            some way), the King publicly acknowledged that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>'s investigation showed no foreign
                            involvement. The King stated that American technicians are in Morocco to
                            teach Moroccans to fly and communicate, that it would be irresponsible
                            for him to incriminate them in the affair and that he was satisfied with
                            the role of the Americans. Our own investigation shows that US personnel
                            were ordered away from the operational area before the F-5s went off on
                            their first strike. Nonetheless, US personnel at the airstrip, in the
                            control towers and in supervisory management roles with the Moroccan
                            facility (e.g. generator plant) are a risk to possible exposure or
                            unwitting involvement in the future.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d128-04" facs="d128-04"/>
                        <p>A major factor in the value of the station's location is the 250
                            frequencies Morocco makes available for our use that could not be
                            entirely compensated for elsewhere. At its own initiative, Navy ran a
                            test list last year on the impact of operating without the Moroccan
                            frequencies. The Navy believes the need of these frequencies will be
                            critical under our Fleet Satellite Communications Systems is operational
                            (estimated FY 75/76) and may be of significant residual importance after
                            them. Since last year's coup, and your request for the development of
                            contingency relocation plans, the Navy has been attempting to reduce its
                            dependence on Morocco in its future planning. As they identified in last
                            year's plan, it would be possible to reduce the number of <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> personnel in Morocco significantly by
                            remote-keying the Moroccan station from another location in the
                            Mediterranean, while retaining use of the frequencies. Cost and
                            degradation of capabilities are mitigating factors that will have to be
                            weighed again in light of the present situation in Morocco.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>Navy should examine immediately ways to reduce direct US involvement and
                            operational participation in the base management of the Moroccan
                            facility at Kenitra, shifting such functions to the Moroccans, with
                            residual US presence limited to advisory roles. This excludes the actual
                            sites of Navy's communications at Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel that are
                            under direct Navy management and control and would be better left that
                            way in the current situation. Also, given the uncertain prospects for
                            the continuity of the regime, Navy's future requirements for the
                            communications facilities should be reviewed with a goal of reducing our
                            dependence and presence as quickly as practicable. I, therefore,
                            recommend that you sign the attached memorandum to the Chairman of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff requesting that such reviews be undertaken.</p>

                                Difficult Position</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In the wake of the unsuccessful attempt by the Moroccan Air Force to
                            assassinate King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> August
                            16, the King is in a weak and difficult position. He has taken personal
                            command of the army but cannot be sure of its loyalty. His overtures to
                            the opposition parties to join the government and participate in
                            parliamentary elections have thus far been rebuffed. The King recognizes
                            his vulnerable situation and is working hard to reestablish his
                            authority and control. He may succeed. On the other hand, given the
                            fragile nature of the situation, another coup or assassination attempt
                            could come at any time and create a dangerously unstable and
                            unpredictable situation in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>U.S. Actions to Date. Your message of congratulations to the King was
                            delivered on the day following the attack and received headlines in the
                            Moroccan press. We have also asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> to convey our deep and
                            sympathetic concern to King Hassan regarding the current situation and
                            to obtain the King's own assessment of his position. Meanwhile, our
                            present policies and programs in Morocco are continuing without change
                            for the time being. Our present posture is to continue to give the King
                            all possible indications of our continuing support.</p>
                        <p>We have, in addition, requested the intelligence community to prepare by
                            mid-September a Special National Intelligence Estimate on Morocco and
                            the King's prospects. We have asked <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            to check its resources in Morocco for possible clues to future
                            dissidence, particularly within the armed forces. The Navy is <pb n="2"

                            <item>(2) we can offer a more modest level of general support for the
                                regime while maintaining a certain distance from the King and
                                keeping lines of communication open to opposition leaders; or</item>
                            <item>(3) we can disengage more convincingly from the monarchy and focus
                                on building relationships with possible successor

                                corresp="#p_OGM1">OUFKIR</persName> WERE MANIPULATED BUT SAYS HE
                            DOES NOT KNOW BY WHOM; IS DETERMINED TO CLEANSE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT;
                            DESIRES ESTABLISH DEMOCRATIC RULE BY MAJORITY UNDER LEGITIMACY OF
                            MONARCHY; COUNTS ON ELECTIONS AND NEW PARLIAMENT TO PROMOTE THIS; LOOKED
                            WELL AND REFLECTED CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO CONTINUE MANAGING
                            AFFAIRS OF STATE. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2.AT 8:00 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 7 I WAS RECEIVED IN AUDIENCE BY KING
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">HASSAN</persName> AT THE SKHIRAT PALACE.
                            AS INSTRUCTED, I REITERATED TO KING OUR PLEASURE AND RELIEF THAT HE HAD
                            SUCESSFULLY OVERCOME SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT AGAINST HIS LIFE, AND OUR DEEP AND
                            SYMPATHETIC CONCERN WITH PROBLEMS HE NOW FACING. I ADDED THAT I HAD ALSO
                            BEEN INSTRUCTED TO SEEK HIS PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SITATION,
                            WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ARMY AND POLITICAL PARTIES.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d130-02" facs="d130-02"/>
                        <p>3. AFTER THANKING ME WARMLY FOR THESE SENTIMENTS, KING BEGAN BY SAYING
                            THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT BOTH GENERALS MEOBOUH AND OUFKIR HAD BEEN
                            “MANIPULATED.” HE WAS FRANK TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT HE HAD NO EVIDENCE
                            WHICH WOULD TELL HIM “WHAT NAME OR WHAT FLAG” TO ATTACH TO THE
                            MANIPULATORS. WHEN I ASKED KING WHY HE WAS SO CERTAIN SOME OUTSIDE
                            ELEMENT WAS BEHIND THE TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS ON HIS LIFE, HE REPLIED
                            THAT IT “HAD TO BE SO” BECAUSE NEITHER <persName corresp="#p_Medbouh1"
                                >MEDBOUH</persName> NOR OUFKIR COULD HAVE MANAGED TO RUN THE COUNTRY
                            BY THEMSELVES, LACKING AS THEY DID ANY POPULAR BASE WHATSOEVER. THEY
                            MUST HAVE COUNTED ON SOMEONE OUTSIDE TO HELP THEM, SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE
                            WILLING FOR HIS OWN PROFIT TO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THE <persName
                                corresp="#p_Medbouh1">MEDBOUH</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >OUFKIR</persName> CLIQUES WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET
                            MOROCCO'S NEEDS AND THUS MAINTAIN THEMSELVES IN POWER. IN ORDER TO AVOID
                            CHAOS AND BECAUSE OF THE MOROCCAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN FOR LEGITIMACY,
                            EITHER GENERAL WOULD ALSO HAVE HAD TO FIND A MEMBER OF THE ALAOUITE
                            DYNASTY TO USE AS A PUPPET. “I HAVE LOTS OF COUSINS, OF COURSE, BUT
                            INTELLECTUALLY WHAT ARE THEY?” THE GENERALS WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE HELP
                            KING SAID. THEY MUST HAVE COUNTED ON AN OUTSIDE ELEMENT.</p>
                        <p>4. THE KING HOPED THAT THE “LIVING FORCES” OF THE NATION WOULD COME TO
                            UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH ATTEMPTS WERE NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE MONARCHY PER
                            SE OR “AGAINST HIM PERSONALLY” BUT RATHER AGAINST LIBERTY AND
                            CIVILIZATION IN MOROCCO. HAD THE MEDBOUH OR <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >OUFKIR</persName> GROUPS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN TO
                            IT THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES WERE PUT OUT OF ACTION PERMANENTLY AND
                            RULE BY MILITARY JUNTA FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. “NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN
                            SAFE.”</p>
                        <p>5. THE KING SAID THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO ESTABLISH DEMOCRACY BY
                            MAJORITY RULE UNDER THE LEGITIMACY OF THE MONARCHY. HE LOOKED TO THE
                            FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS AND THE RESULTANT PARLIAMENT TO PROMOTE THIS. HE
                            COULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE THESIS HELD BY <persName corresp="#p_OGM1"
                                >OUFKIR</persName> THAT UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES CANNOT HAVE
                            DEMOCRACY: EVEN IF THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES SHOULD FIND
                            THEMSELVES IN A MINORITY POSITION IN THE PARLIAMENT AS A RESULT OF THE
                            ELECTIONS, THIS WOULD NOT PRECLUDE THEIR REPRESENTATIVES FROM BEING
                            APPOINTED TO THE GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY EVEN TO THE POSITION OF PRIME
                            MINISTER. THE KING WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE HEAVY REGISTRATION FOR THE
                            ELECTIONS WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE. <pb n="3" xml:id="d130-03"
                                facs="d130-03"/>THE PARTIES, HE SAID, HAD ORDERED THEIR MEMBERS TO

                        <p>6. WITH REGARD TO THE ARMY, THE KING SAID THAT IT HAD TO BE “CLEANSED.”
                            HE HAS DETERMINED THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE EVENTS OF AUGUST 16 SHOULD BE
                            PUNISHED “TO THE LIMIT.” THE ARMY HAD TO BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. I
                            REMARKED THAT WE HAD RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS MUCH
                            RESENTMENT AMONG MILITARY OFFICERS, AND A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM
                            PERSONALLY, AS A RESULT OF HIS SHARP WORDS TO THE MILITARY AFTER AUGUST
                            16 AND BECAUSE THE AMMUNITION HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM MILITARY UNITS.
                            THE KING SAID THAT THE MILITARY, BY THEIR SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR, HAD
                            DESERVED THE DRESSING DOWN HE GAVE THEM. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS NOT NORMAL
                            THAT MILITARY UNITS SHOULD HAVE THEIR AMMUNITION WITH THEM; IN MOST
                            COUNTRIES IN PEACETIME AMMUNITION WAS KEPT APART FROM THE UNITS IN
                            SPECIAL STORAGE PLACES.</p>

                        <p>7. THE KING CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT HE WAS A “FREE MAN,” LOYAL BUT NOT
                            SUBSERVIENT TO HIS FRIENDS. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS, BUT HE WAS
                            DETERMINED TO PURSUE THIS COURSE.</p>

                            OTHER PERSON PRESENT DURING THE AUDIENCE, DROPPED BY THE HOUSE
                            AFTERWARDS TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD
                            ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION OF ANY FOREIGN MANIPULATION Of EITHER <persName

                            WHY THE KING SEEMED SO CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE BEHIND THE
                            GENERALS, <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> MERELY SAID THAT
                            THE KING HAD DEDUCED THIS BY THE LOGIC OF THE SITUATION AS HE HAD
                            EXPRESSED IT TO ME.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> WENT ON TO SAY THAT THERE
                            WAS NOTHING THE KING WOULD LIKE BETTER THAN TO BE <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d130-05" facs="d130-05"/>A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH LIKE QUEEN
                            ELIZABETH. “DO YOU THINK HE ENJOYS BEING SHOT AT?” IF HE FELT THERE WERE
                            A POLITICAL STRUCTURE CAPABLE OF RUNNING THE COUNTRY, HE WOULD RETIRE TO
                            A CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION AT ONCE. HE MIGHT EVEN, IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES,
                            STEP DOWN FROM THE THRONE AND RESIDE IN MOROCCO AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN,
                            “AS ALL HIS PROPERTY IS HERE.” HOWEVER, SUCH A POLITICAL STRUCTURE DOES
                            NOT EXIST AND MUST BE CREATED.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> SAID THAT IN HIS
                            CHARACTERISTIC FRANKNESS WITH HIS AMERICAN FRIENDS, THE KING HAD TOLD
                            ASSISTANT SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName> DURING
                            HIS VISIT HERE LAST YEAR THAT HE EXPECTED WITHIN HOURS OR DAYS TO
                            ANNOUNCE THE FORMATION OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT WITH OPPOSITION
                            REPRESENTATIVES. THE KING SAID THIS BECAUSE HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT THE
                            OPPOSITION HAD ACCEPTED HIS OFFER OF “TEN MINISTRIES, INCLUDING THE
                            PRIME MINISTRY, AND EVEN AN UNDER SECRETARYSHIP IN THE MINISTRY OF THF
                            INTERIOR.” HOWEVER, WHEN HE RECEIVED NATIONAL FRONT DELEGATES WITHIN
                            MINUTES AFTER <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">NEWSOM</persName>'S DEPARTURE,
                            THEY TOLD HIM TO HIS STUPEFACTION THAT INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING WHAT HE HAD
                            OFFERED, THEY WANTED “EVERYTHING, EXCEPT DEFENSE AND P.T.T.” THIS THE
                            KING COULD NOT AGREE TO, SINCE THE NATIONAL FRONT HAD NOT GAINED THE
                            RIGHT THROUGH ELECTIONS TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE COUNTRY; THUS THE
                            NEGOTIATIONS HAD FAILED. THE KING'S READINESS TO GRANT SO MANY POSTS TO
                            THE OPPOSITION SHOWED HIS SINCERE DESIRE TO SHARE POWER. IT HAD BEEN
                            REVEALING THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL FRONT HAD FRANKLY
                            CONFESSED TO THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES AS TO
                            WHO AMONG THEM SHOULD BE THE PRIME MINISTER. OSMAN CAUTIONED THAT WHAT
                            THE POLITICAL LEADERS SAY PUBLICLY OFTEN DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT THEY
                            REALLY THINK.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> HOPED THAT MOROCCO WOULD
                            BE SPARED ANOTHER OF THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES IT HAD RECENTLY HAD AND
                            BE GIVEN THE TIME TO WORK FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT BY THE KING OF

                            HAPPENED. I COMMENTED THAT THE KING HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM OF IMAGE.
                            OSMAN AGREED.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> SAID THAT THE PEOPLE
                            FAVORED THE CURBING OF THE MILITARY. IT WAS FEARED BECAUSE OF THE
                            EXCESSES IT HAD COMMITTFD AGAINST CIVILIANS. THE GOVERNMENT HAD RECEIVED
                            REPORTS OF RESENTMENT AMONG MILITARY OFFICERS SIMILAR TO THOSE I HAD
                            MENTIONED TO THE KING.</p>
                        <p>13. THE KING, <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> SAID, IS AN
                            INTELLECTUAL. HE WOULD WELCOME SOMEONE OF HIS STATURE COMING INTO
                            AUTHORITY SO THAT PROBLEMS COULD BE MEANINGFULLY DEBATED.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_OA1">OSMAN</persName> CONCLUDED BY SAYING THAT
                            THEY COUNTED ON CONTINUING US SYMPATHY AND HELP.</p>
                        <p>15. COMMENT: THE KING LOOKED AS WELL AS I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM AND SEEMED
                            FULLY IN COMMAND OF HIMSELF. HE WAS ELOQUENT AND SELF-ASSURED AS HE
                            DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS.</p>
                        <p>16. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE REALLY THINKS THAT THERE WAS A FOREIGN HAND
                            IN THE TWO PLOTS. HE FINDS IT USEFUL To ADVANCE THIS THESIS, WHICH SO
                            EXAGGERATES THE IMPORTANCE OF MOROCCO, TO DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM THE REAL
                            CAUSES OF THF TWO ATTEMPTS. HIS STUBBORN REFUSAL TO ADMIT THAT ANY
                            FAILING ON HIS PART COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED
                            WAS APPARENT IN THE CONVERSATION.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d130-07" facs="d130-07"/>
                        <p>17. AS TO HOW HE INTENDS TO PROCEED OVER THE COMING WEEKS TO ASSURE THE
                            CONTINUATION OF ROYAL RULE IN MOROCCO, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE INTENDS
                            TO TRY TO LURE THE POLITICAL PARTIES INTO PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTIONS
                            AND THAT HE MAY WELL BE PREPARED TO SEE THE RESULTANT PARLIAMENT
                            EXERCISE A WIDER DEGREE OF AUTHORITY. MEANWHILE, HE WILL PURGE THE ARMY
                            IN ORDER TO TRY TO REMOVE ANY FURTHER DANGER FROM THAT QUARTER. I DO NOT
                            THINK THAT HE HAS ANY INTENTION OF ABDICATING, AND I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT
                            IF A PARLIAMENT WITH BROADER POWERS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED, IT WILL HAVE
                            SOME DIFFICULTY IN PREVENTING ROYAL ENCROACHMENT UPON ITS
                            PREROGATIVES.</p>
                        <p>18. I NOW AM GLAD THE DEPARTMENT INSTRUCTED ME TO SEE THE KING. I HAD
                            BEEN RELUCTANT TO SEEK AN AUDIENCE FOR FEAR THAT UNDER THE LINGERING
                            EFFECTS <pb n="8" xml:id="d130-08" facs="d130-08"/>OF AUGUST 16 HE MIGHT
                            SAY SOMETHING UNPALATABLE ABOUT OUR MILITARY PRESENCE. HOWEVER, HE WAS
                            EXCEEDINGLY CORDIAL AND MADE NO REFERENCE WHATSOEVER TO OUR MILITARY OR
                            TO ANY EMBARRASSMENT ARISING FROM THE AMERICAN ANGLE TO THE AUGUST 16
                            EVENTS. NONETHELESS, THE THESIS HE SET FORTH WITH REGARD TO THE “NAME OR
                            FLAG” WHICH WAS BEHIND THE PLOTTERS COULD OBVIOUSLY BE APPLIED TO THE
                            UNITED STATES IF ONE WISHED TO DO SO. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE THOSE IN HIS
                            ENTOURAGE WHO ARE ALLEGING US COMPLICITY IN THE AUGUST 16 ATTACK. I
                            REITERATE MY BELIEF, HOWEVER, THAT THE KING DOES NOT REALLY THINK WE
                            WERE INVOLVED; HE IS USING THE FOREIGN FACTOR THEORY TO DISTRACT
                            ATTENTION FROM THE REGIME'S AND HIS PERSONAL FAILINGS AND TO KEEP
                            PEOPLE, INCLUDING OURSELVES, OFF BALANCE.<lb/>GDS </p>

                        <p>This estimate was requested by the Department of State to assess the
                            outlook for the Moroccan monarchy in the light of the 16 August coup
                            attempt. It is not intended to supersede <gloss target="#t_NIE1"

                            SECRET, since the analysis of underlying social, political, and economic
                            issues in that paper remains generally valid.</p>
                        <p>This paper concludes that King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is in a seriously weakened position and that a
                            successful attack on him could take place at any time. He retains some
                            assets and is a skillful political manipulator, but he devotes
                            insufficient effort to governing. The loyalty of the military
                            establishment, on which the throne has traditionally relied, is severely
                            strained and the King can no longer count upon his inherited role as
                            religious and temporal leader to sustain him.</p>
                        <p>In the near term, an attempt against <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is most likely to come as a blow by a handful of
                            military officers bent on ousting a monarch whom they now believe is an
                            obstacle to Morocco's progress. Over the longer term, a move against
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> could come as a part
                            of broader deterioration in the body politic, perhaps including a
                            breakdown in public order or the development of a revolutionary
                            movement. Since Hassan has isolated himself from most significant
                            sources of support in the country the odds are that one or another
                            attempt against him will succeed.</p>

                        <p>THE ESTIMATE</p>
                        <p>1. In little more than a year, there have been two attempts to eliminate
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. The details of the
                            16 August attack on his plane and the planning behind it are still
                            unclear, but there is good evidence that the Minister of Defense and
                            strong man of the Moroccan Armed Forces, Major General Mohamed Oufkir,
                            was implicated in the plot. In any case, it is widely believed in
                            Morocco that he directed the attempt and that he was killed for this
                            reason. There do not appear to be any officers capable of replacing
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> as a strong commander
                            of the Moroccan Armed Forces. King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has abolished the position of Defense Minister
                            and has assumed direct control of the military establishment.</p>
                        <p>2. It is noteworthy that both the July 1971 attempt to overthrow the King
                            and the August 1972 effort were carried out by small groups of military
                            officers. We have little hard evidence about the beliefs and ultimate
                            aims of these men. Morocco has fundamental social and economic problems,
                            and discontent is growing in many parts of the population, a state of
                            unease which is reflected—though rather ineffectively—in the political
                            parties. As far as we know, however, there were no contacts between the
                            plotters and the civilian political leaders. The military plotters were
                            almost exclusively conservative, rural Berbers—the majority element in
                            the officer corps. Available evidence indicates that the would-be
                            regicides aimed at eliminating the King and getting rid of the corrupt
                            and wasteful entourage that surrounds him. The officers did not appear
                            bent on bringing about sweeping social and economic change, although
                            they sought to constrict the monarchy's power secretly at least.
                            Relatively few officers were directly involved in each attempt, and
                            among others who may have had advance knowledge none appears to have
                            been sufficiently loyal to report the plans to the palace.</p>
                        <p>3. Both attempts took place in almost complete isolation from the general
                            public. There was little enthusiasm expressed for either, and few among
                            the populace seem to care whether <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> survives or not. In his 11 years in power,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has expended much of
                            the political capital he inherited from his father—<pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d131-04" facs="d131-04"/>the religious and political
                            legitimacy of a three hundred year-old dynasty, the throne's prominent
                            role in the struggle for independence, and a measure of popular regard
                            for the monarch's effectiveness as a ruler.</p>
                        <p>4. Following the two attempted coups, King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has expressed his determination to go on ruling
                            his country as before, but he cannot be sure who is loyal to him and who
                            is not. Members of the officer corps cannot be sure of their own
                            position or that of their brothers in uniform. The ministers and senior
                            officials for whom service to <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has been the route to riches are bound to
                            consider whether their fortunes are now tied to a waning star.
                            Opposition political leaders will consider whether recent events have
                            made the time ripe for them to press <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> for a share of power in the government or whether
                            they should bide their time. These and other forces—students, labor
                            organizations, religious leaders—will be jockeying for advantage in the
                            months to come.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s Position: Liabilities
                            and Assets</p>
                        <p>5. The key question of what effect this second coup attempt will have on
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> himself is yet to be
                            answered. He has twice shown an admirable capacity to escape from a hail
                            of bullets and take charge of the situation. He has also over the years
                            demonstrated great ability at political manipulation, balancing this
                            political party, that clique or that person off against one another. But
                            he has also devoted a large part of his time to the pursuit of pleasure.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> cannot buy the loyalty
                            of his officers and administrators nor count upon his inherited role as
                            religious and temporal leader to win him popular support, his future
                            would seem to lie in changing his method of governing and giving the
                            appearance at least of having the welfare of his people at heart. The
                            coup attempt of 1971 did not teach him anything in this regard. The
                            attempt of 1972 may, but we doubt it strongly. His initial response has
                            been to blame virtually everyone else in Morocco for the conditions that
                            brought attempts on his life. He does not seem to recognize that his own
                            performance can be faulted; he is a very traditional monarch in the
                            sense that he believes authority is his by right of inherited status and
                            does not need to be earned by effective governing of his realm.</p>
                        <p>6. Traditionally the Moroccan military establishment has been a basic
                            prop for the throne, providing not only the power to maintain internal
                            security but a cadre of favored people from which appointments to key
                            provincial administrative positions were made. There are no doubt many
                            officers who remain loyal to the King, but he cannot be sure who they
                            are. He reacted to the disloyalty of a few by giving a scathing talk to
                            senior officers of the Royal Moroccan Forces in which he impugned their
                            integrity and that of the institution of which they are a part.
                            Furthermore, this denunciation was broadcast to the entire population.
                            He has taken over the running of the military establishment on grounds
                            that he cannot trust any of his military subordinates; in these
                            circumstances the loyalty of the military has been put under severe
                            strain.</p>
                        <p>7. Since <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s reliance on
                                <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> (who had been close to
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and to his father)
                            turned out to have becn misplaced, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> must worry deeply about the loyalty of others.
                            With <persName corresp="#p_OGM1">Oufkir</persName> dead there is a gap
                            in the administration which cannot be readily filled. Temporarily, the
                            King has appointed General Driss Ben Omar to assist him in administering
                            the armed forces. But the General is not considered to be a strong
                            person; moreover, he is not in good health and has the further
                            disadvantage of being an Arab in charge of a largely Berber officer
                            corps.</p>
                        <p>8. In the aftermath of the two coup attempts there has been considerable
                            weeding out of top levels in the Moroccan Armed Forces. In contrast to
                            the 15 generals serving in June 1971, <pb n="5" xml:id="d131-05"
                                facs="d131-05"/>there are now only four. By purging the top echelon
                            of the armed forces, however, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> also runs the risk of putting into important
                            positions officers in the ranks of major to colonel who may be even more
                            disaffected with the monarchy. The younger of these men, frequently
                            better trained and educated than their seniors, appear to have chafed
                            under the command of older generals, many of whom were pampered by the
                            King and had become tainted with his dissolute life style. The purge has
                            removed, however, virtually all the senior officers who had followings,
                            and it may take some time before new leading personalities appear and
                            cliques form around them.</p>
                        <p>9. We have at present very little direct evidence as to attitudes of
                            individuals or groups within the Moroccan officer corps. The fact that
                            two groups, within a period of little more than a year, have taken the
                            risks involved in an assassination attempt should be convincing evidence
                            of deep dissatisfaction in the officer corps with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s rule. We doubt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s purges have eradicated this
                            dissatisfaction. Indeed, there are signs that his tongue-lashing and
                            withdrawal of ammunition from military units has turned others against
                            him. The attempts of 1971 and 1972 were made by officers who evidently
                            sought more efficient government, but were conservative in political
                            outlook. As younger officers move up in seniority we believe the
                            attitude of would-be coup-makers is likely to change, moving toward more
                            radical social and political forms.</p>
                        <p>10. There are more persons of Arab origin among younger officers and thus
                            a greater chance of any given individual being influenced by political
                            ideas in other Arab states. Libya has been loud in praise of Moroccan
                            plotters, although there is no evidence of Libyan contact with either
                            the 1971 or 1972 plotters. The Libyans are assisting Moroccan civilian
                            exiles, but they appear to have no direct working relationship with
                            dissidents inside Morocco. Moreover, Qaddafi's regime commands little
                            respect in the Moroccan Armed Forces. The Algerians, who are more likely
                            to have influence in Morocco, have no love for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> or the monarchy, but are
                            concerned that a successor might be worse from their point of view.
                            Hence, Algiers will be cautious about supporting anti-Hassan
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> does have some assets.
                            The countryside, loyal to the monarchy in a passive way, provides a
                            backdrop of stability. The King cannot count on rural support to deter
                            opposition initiatives, however. Such support as he derives from these
                            grass roots is diffused and disorganized and, in the King's mind,
                            probably exaggerated. Moreover, the rural populace is largely unarmed
                            and would not constitute an effective counterforce in the event of
                            further blows at him.</p>
                        <p>12. There is a substantial number of court officers, senior officials and
                            ministers, such as Prime Minister Karim-Lamrani and the
                                <persName>Benhima</persName> brothers (Ministers of Foreign Affairs
                            and Interior), who owe their positions and frequently their wealth to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s favor. Some of these
                            will serve him well, either out of conviction that his way is correct or
                            perhaps as a consequence of seeing no alternative for themselves but to
                            support his rule. Others probably will distance themselves somewhat in
                            an effort to avoid ruination if the royal house is overthrown. But
                            virtually all of these people will devote a certain amount of time and
                            energy to insuring that they appear loyal to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, to assessing the loyalty of
                            others, and to putting assets away abroad for the future. This, plus
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s assumption of more
                            direct control of day-to-day decisions, is likely to result in a decline
                            in governmental efficiency. The King himself has set a poor standard of
                            attention to administration, budgetary matters, and the like, and shows
                            no sign of changing.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d131-06" facs="d131-06"/>
                        <p>13. The intelligence apparatus of the government is likely to absorb a
                            great amount of the King's attention. It has already failed to alert him
                            of two potentially disastrous blows at the throne and he must try to
                            insure that he is not taken by surprise a third time. His principal
                            intelligence officer is the experienced Colonel Ahmed Dlimi who heads
                            the palace intelligence service. Dlimi has served <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in a variety of intelligence and
                            security posts over the past 10 years. We presume, however, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will not depend on one
                            service alone but will also try to place loyal officers in charge of the
                            military intelligence department and of the security apparatus within
                            the Ministry of Interior. He will no doubt be willing to put up with the
                            inefficiency of a number of competing services in the hope of increasing
                            the chances of receiving warning of impending danger.</p>
                        <p>14. The King will seek to maintain his control by balancing various
                            military and security forces. He reportedly plans to reduce the size of
                            the regular army (now about 50,000) and may lean more on the gendarmerie
                            and other internal security forces. In the near term at least, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> probably could count on these
                            forces, which total 12,000 men spread around the country, and on various
                            elite units of the army to crack down on manifestations of public
                            disorder. The gendarmerie has received more favorable treatment than the
                            armed forces and has shown no signs of disloyalty in either the 1971 or
                            1972 coup attempts.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> also benefits from the
                            lack of unity and common purpose among those who oppose him. The legal
                            civilian political parties in Morocco wish to share some of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s power. They have little in
                            common with the military establishment. Moreover, neither the
                            politicians nor the military are likely to believe that they can force
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> into the role of a
                            constitutional monarch. The parties, principally the Istiqlal and its
                            offshoot the National Union of Popular Forces, have steadily lost
                            effectiveness over the last 10 years or so. They have had little success
                            in attracting support from an apathetic populace. Their very poor
                            performance in office in the late 1950s and early 1960s made it
                            relatively easy for <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> to
                            push them aside even before he assumed direct rule and suspended
                            parliament in 1965. The leadership of both parties is far from
                            inspiring, is given to quarrels, and has been readily out-maneuvered by
                            the King.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s technique has been to
                            hint at certain limited reforms, to dispense some royal favors, and to
                            promise a chance at office—and the perquisites that go with it—for
                            political leaders willing to collaborate or cooperate with him. He has
                            generally held out just enough promise to attract the more venal party
                            leaders and to divide party councils about the advisability of going
                            along with him. And on at least one occasion he has double-crossed the
                            parties by making a political move during a period when they understood
                            him to be awaiting their reply on a royal offer.</p>
                        <p>17. In present circumstances the political leaders face a dilemma. If the
                            King offers them some role in the government, as he may well do if he
                            permits elections under the new constitution, they would risk alienating
                            some of their supporters by accepting, since Hassan almost certainly
                            would not offer them truly meaningful political power, nor even a chance
                            at it through free elections. If, on the other hand, they choose to go
                            into outright opposition, say employing tactics of public meetings and
                            demonstrations, they risk severe and violent repression from the
                            security forces. In this situation our best guess is that, while some
                            political leaders may reach an accommodation with the King, most will
                            try to straddle the fence as long as possible and in effect do very
                            little but make some verbal remonstrations against the monarchy. They
                            may be influenced <pb n="7" xml:id="d131-07" facs="d131-07"/>in this
                            course by a judgment that the King will not last for long.</p>
                        <p>Can <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> Survive?</p>
                        <p>18. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will be disposed to
                            employ every manipulative weapon at his command—including the
                            rearrangement of foreign ties—in order to maintain his throne. Morocco
                            presently has close bonds to France and to the US. The former is the
                            major source of foreign investment and is the principal foreign cultural
                            influence in Morocco; the latter supplies some $45 million annually in
                            aid, mostly in surplus food. <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> himself is a Francophile, and he is basically
                            friendly to the US, but the foreign ties he favors are not generally
                            popular in Morocco. Prior to the latest coup attempt, he had been
                            increasing the French role in his internal security apparatus; he may
                            now attempt to engage the US more firmly in defense of his regime,
                            calling for greater intelligence support and other forms of assistance
                            in the security sphere, despite the domestic opposition that would
                            follow such a move.</p>
                        <p>19. If he comes to sense that political party leaders are making headway
                            against him, however, he probably would want to divert attention to
                            other matters. The classic maneuver in such circumstances is pandering
                            to xenophobic sentiment. He might well choose to move against French
                            investment in Morocco or to reassert Moroccan claims to Spanish
                            territories in North Africa. In addition, the US military presence in
                            Morocco,* principally the communications facilities at Kenitra, could
                            appear to him as a particularly inviting target. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> probably has a nagging suspicion
                            that somehow one of the scores of Americans at the training mission in
                            Kenitra could have given warning of impending trouble on 16 August. In
                            any event, he knows that civilian political forces, particularly the
                            Istiqlal Party, are opposed to the US military presence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is aware that some circles in
                            Morocco favor the US presence, but circumstances might develop in which
                            he concluded that he would gain important nationalist support by
                            ejecting the Americans.</p>
                        <p>* The US military presence in Morocco consists of a training team for the
                            Moroccan Air Force and a communications school at Kenitra, plus a naval
                            communications facility at two sites near Kenitra, which serves the
                            Sixth Fleet. Some 4,000 personnel and dependents are present in the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>20. The elements of classic tragedy are present in Morocco. Some
                            monarchs—Hussein and the Shah come to mind—have faced similarly parlous
                            situations and survived. But they had such assets as a body of loyal
                            subordinates, a disposition to work at the business of governing, and a
                            willingness to make the throne an agent of change. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has lost the support of most
                            important groups in the country and the people generally are apathetic
                            as to his fate. Moreover, he is a dilettante, is convinced of his own
                            righteousness and seems unable to comprehend that his survival and that
                            of his dynasty depends, at the very least, on winning the support of
                            some influential groups and on administering the country more
                            effectively.</p>
                        <p>21. Another effort to remove <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> could come very shortly or it could be delayed
                            for years. In the near term, it is most likely to come as those of 1971
                            and 1972 have a blow by a handful of military officers bent on removing
                            a monarch whom they now believe is an obstacle to Morocco's progress. In
                            short, further blows at the King appear certain; he is not of a
                            character to abdicate and go into exile. He will stay and try to ward
                            off blows, even though there is no way of knowing when or where they
                            will come. But since <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has
                            cut himself off from most significant sources of support in the country,
                            the odds are that one or another attempt against him will succeed.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d131-08" facs="d131-08"/>
                        <p>22. Even if <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> stays in power
                            for a year or two, there are potential sources of formidable political
                            trouble in Morocco. Unemployment and poverty are endemic and growing in
                            the cities which, with their large numbers of impoverished slum dwellers
                            and frustrated students and intellectuals, are breeding grounds for
                            dissent. Organized labor, the student organizations, or radical
                            political groups such as the communists' illegal Party for Liberation
                            and Socialism may come to believe that the recent blows show King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s weakness. They could
                            try to further weaken the King by such revolutionary tactics as mass
                            demonstrations, general strikes, and riots, and perhaps even by turning
                            to urban terrorism. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> would
                            certainly respond to such development with vigor. There is a chance that
                            some of the forces he relies on to maintain order might be unwilling to
                            take serious risks on behalf of a King to whom they are no longer loyal.
                            And if violence were to persist over an extended period, it could add a
                            very unsettling element to <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                            >Hassan</persName>'s control, perhaps leading to a breakdown in public
                            order.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>?</p>
                        <p>23. Just what Morocco would look like without <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is most difficult to delineate at this point in
                            time. The makeup of the forces that toppled him would of course do much
                            to determine the nature of the regime that succeeds him. A successful
                            coup by another group of conservative Berber officers could produce a
                            government not notably different in political outlook than the present
                            one, but presumably less corrupt and possibly more efficient. On the
                            other hand, the initiative might be seized by more socialist-minded
                            officers from the middle or lower ranks. Their orientation could be
                            basically “Morocco-first” and reformist, or it could be of a
                            revolutionary cast and more militantly Arab.</p>
                        <p>24. Any successor government, even a regency, would encounter an increase
                            in the divisive tendencies characteristic of the country. For all
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>'s extravagance and
                            inattention to the nuts and bolts of government, the royal house has
                            provided a certain focus for the disparate elements of Moroccan
                            society.</p>
                        <p>25. Given the problems it would face, almost any government that took
                            over from <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> would seek to
                            increase its own popularity by a cheap and easy victory. The foreign
                            presence in Morocco would almost certainly come under attack. Inviting
                            the US to leave its military communications facilities would be an
                            obvious move for any government. A nationalist one would almost
                            certainly do this—and probably also reduce the French presence. Even a
                            conservative regime would be tempted to take anti-foreign measures to
                            attract the support of political elements in the cities. Under almost
                            any conceivable circumstances, there would be substantially less
                            willingness to permit a continued US military presence than we have
                            enjoyed since Morocco became independent.</p>

                            ELEMENTS, MOROCCO'S POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES WILL HARDEN. IN THIS

                            DESCRIBING TWO ATTEMPTS ON KING'S LIFE WITHIN PAST TWO YEARS AS EFFORT
                            BY CERTAIN TRUSTED MEN WITHIN ARMY TO OVERTURN KING FOR REASONS NOT
                            COMPLETELY CLEAR. HE SAID ARMY AS WHOLE WAS NOT INVOLVED.
                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >HASSAN</persName> HAS TAKEN ENLIGHTENED ATTITUDE IN EXAMINING WAYS

                            CLOSER COOPERATION WITH THOSE ELEMENTS OF OPPOSITION WHICH SUPPORT
                            FUNDAMENTAL MOROCCAN INSTITUTIONS. <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> HOPES THAT TALKS WITH OPPOSITION
                            WILL LEAD TO BROADENING OF GOVERNMENT AND RETURN TO PARLIAMENTARY
                            SYSTEM. <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID THAT FRENCH AND THIRD WORLD
                            PRESS HAS CARRIED MANY FALSE STORIES CONCERNING MOROCCAN/US RELATIONS.
                                <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> EMPHASIZED THAT KING HAS ABSOLUTE
                            CONFIDENCE IN US AND ALL REPORTS TO CONTRARY BELONG IN WORLD OF FANTASY.
                            SECRETARY TOLD <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> THAT US PLACES HIGH

                            REGARD FOR KING. RECOUNTING PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S GREAT RESPECT FOR

                                >NIXON</persName> HAS SAME FEELINGS. SECRETARY EXPRESSED HOPE THAT

                            <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID THAT AS <gloss target="#t_GOM1"

                            OPPOSITION, ITS POSITIONS ON CERTAIN ISSUES MAY HARDEN. ONE ISSUE IS
                            THAT OF US BASES IN MOROCCO. <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID THAT
                            WORLD SCENE HAS CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE 1963 WHEN JOINT COMMUNIQUE
                            ESTABLISHED US BASES IN MOROCCO, NEED FOR BASES IS NOT NOW SO
                            IMPERATIVE. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            WOULD LIKE EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO RE-EXAMINE ENTIRE QUESTION WITH US.
                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID IT IS NOT QUESTION OF CLOSING ALL
                            BASES OR REMOVING ALL US TECHNICIANS. HOWEVER, THREE BASES NOW IN
                            MOROCCO (INCLUDED KENITRA) MIGHT BE REDUCED TO TWO. <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID THAT WHEN KING PARTICIPATES IN
                            AFRICAN OR NON-ALIGNED GATHERINGS, OTHERS CRITICIZE HIM FOR PERMITTING
                            US TO MAINTAIN BASES IN MOROCCO. KING CANNOT ARGUE FROM POINT OF VIEW OF
                            SELF-INTEREST. <pb n="3" xml:id="d133-03" facs="d133-03"/> US IS NOT IN
                            MOROCCO DEFEND IT. IN SPAIN, THERE ARE WELL-KNOWN ARRANGEMENTS FOR US
                            FINANCIAL AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE. IN MOROCCO THERE IS NO SUCH
                            JUSTIFICATION; GOM PROVIDES BASES TO US ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS FRIENDSHIP
                            FOR US. <persName>BENHIMA</persName> ADDED THAT MOROCCO ECONOMY DOES NOT
                            EVEN BENEFIT INDIRECTLY FROM BASES: US TECHNICIANS AT KENITRA RECEIVE
                            ALL THEIR SUPPLIES FROM US. SECRETARY ASKED WHETHER CRITICISM BY OTHER
                            COUNTRIES OF US BASES IN MOROCCO DOES NOT CONSTITUTE INTERFERENCE IN
                            MOROCCAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. BENHIMA AGREED BUT RETURNED TO ARGUMENT THAT
                            CONDITIONS OVER PAST TEN YEARS HAVE CHANGED NOTING THAT US HAS CLOSED
                            BASES MENTIONED (WHEELUS) AND ALTERED BASE ARRANGEMENTS ELSEWHERE.
                                <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID KING HAS SHOWN HIS
                            INDEPENDENCE BY MAINTAINING BASES IN FACE OF PRESSURE.
                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID THAT SITUATION SHOULD BE
                            RE-EXAMINED NOW SO THAT MOROCCO CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION INTERESTS OF
                            US BEFORE PRESSURES RISE FROM NEW GOVERNMENT. SECRETARY ASKED WHEN NEW
                            GOVERNMENT LIKELY TO EMERGE. <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID IT IS NOT
                            YET CLEAR BUT SUGGESTED PROBABLY BEFORE APRIL. SECRETARY SAID WE WOULD
                            BE BACK IN TOUCH ON THIS MATTER.</p>
                        <p>6. SPANISH SAHARA: <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID ADDITIONAL
                            ISSUE OF CONCERN TO KING IS THAT OF SPANISH SAHARA. MOROCCO IS CONCERNED
                            THAT SPAIN IS NOT APPROACHING MATTER IN REASSURING WAY. WHILE MOROCCO
                            AGREED WITH SPAIN TO TAKE MATTER TO <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            SPAIN HAS ABSTAINED ON ALL UN RESOLUTIONS FOR PAST TWO YEARS. OPPOSITION
                            PARTIES ARE VERY CONCERNED, AS ARE OTHERS IN MOROCCO.
                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID KING COULD ACHIEVE NATIONAL UNITY
                            VERY QUICKLY BY CHALLENGING SPAIN ON THIS ISSUE, BUT WOULD OF COURSE NOT
                            PRECIPITATE SUCH ACTION. <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> SAID MOROCCO
                            IS PREPARED TO GIVE SPAIN PARTICIPATION IN SAHARA PHOSPHATES AND EVEN TO
                            ALLOW BASES TO PROTECT ITS POSITION IN CANARY ISLANDS.
                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> SAID THAT MOROCCO IS VERY CONCERNED
                            ABOUT INCREASED LIBYAN ACTIVITY IN SPANISH SAHARA, NOTING THAT IF
                            LIBYANS PROVIDED ARMS SO WOULD MOROCCO. <gloss target="#t_FM1"

                                <persName>BENHIMA</persName> EXPRESSED HOPE THAT US COULD HELP
                            PERSUADE SPAIN TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBLE POSITION ON ISSUE. SECRETARY

                        <p>Following the second coup attempt in a little over one year against King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> of Morocco, NSSM 160
                            was issued asking for a study of US policy toward Morocco and an
                            evaluation of our interests there. The study prepared [next tab - “NSSM
                            160 Study"] was to identify US interests as precisely as possible,
                            evaluate their relative importance, and delineate alternative approaches
                            that we might take to serve those interests. Attached to the NSSM 160
                            options paper [small tab marked “<gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss>”]

                            Moroccan Monarchy,” as well as a detailed fact sheet on Morocco and
                            contingency papers on the Kenitra communications complex and the Voice
                            of America relay station at Tangier.</p>
                        <p>The operational situation with which we are dealing is this: Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> told Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that the King would like to review the US
                            military presence in Morocco at an early opportunity. Since then, the
                            general outline of Moroccan thinking has emerged as follows:</p>
                        <p>—They would like the US to consolidate its facilities from three to two.
                            This means closing the Kenitra training base (of little intrinsic
                            importance to us, but of high visibility), but continuing at Sidi Yahia
                            and Bouknadel, two important elements in the US naval communications
                            network in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic.</p>
                        <p>—Morocco would like a higher “rent” payment for the remaining facilities.
                            Our current aid effort is not formally linked to the use of the three
                            facilities, and the Moroccans would like to establish this link, citing
                            our arrangements with Spain as a model.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, Morocco wants more control of the US facilities. Some Moroccans
                            still have lingering doubts over the US role in the most recent
                            assassination attempt against the King.</p>

                        <p>This analytical summary will be organized around the assessment of the
                            situation contained in the options paper and the <gloss

                            Future</p>
                        <p>—The August 16 coup and assassination attempt against <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has left the Moroccan military
                            divided and badly shaken. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            has taken direct control of the armed forces, has withdrawn their
                            ammunition, has publicly berated them, and has relieved senior officers
                            of their commands. Morale and loyalty are both low, and another coup
                            attempt from within the armed forces could come at any time.</p>
                        <p>—The King's reaction to the most recent attempt on his life has been to
                            blame everyone but himself. He shows no signs of preparing to change his
                            style of rule, nor does he devote much time or energy to the business of
                            governing. Unlike Jordan's King Hussein and the Shah of Iran, King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> does not sense the
                            need to bring about reforms as a way of bolstering the monarchy. He does
                            not readily take advice, and shows no signs of changing his ostentatious
                            personal life-style.</p>
                        <p>—The King is unlikely to make a real opening to the opposition that would
                            allow it to share power and responsibility with him. After going through
                            the motions of consulting with opposition parties with a view toward
                            broadening the base of the regime, the King has named his brother-in-law
                            as Prime Minister, who in turn has formed a government of unimpressive
                            technicians and totally lacking in opposition members. Elections are
                            promised for next spring, but for the moment the political atmosphere in
                            the country is rather bleak.</p>
                        <p>—The French and Algerians, as influential third parties, continue to
                            support <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, but are hedging
                            their bets in case he falls by keeping in touch with possible successor
                            leaders. The Libyans remain actively hostile to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, but with little capability to
                            act. The real danger to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is
                            internal, not external.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d134-03" facs="d134-03"/>
                        <p>—As a means of staying in power by striking a nationalist pose, the King
                            may try to move against the large foreign presence in Morocco, although
                            the urgency of his doing so is less now that his attempt at
                            reconciliation with the opposition has failed. US facilities at the
                            Kenitra complex would be particularly vulnerable. Already the King has
                            said that the American presence should be the subject of new talks with
                            the US. Any successor government would be even more likely to move
                            against the US presence.</p>
                        <p>—Despite the apparent odds against him, <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> still has some assets that may help him stay in
                            power. The countryside appears to remain passively loyal; the
                            Gendarmerie seems to be a reliable instrument for maintaining internal
                            order; the opposition political parties are divided and not particularly
                            effective; this year the economy has performed reasonably well, although
                            long-term social and economic problems remain; new governors have been
                            appointed in the countryside and may help improve administration there;
                            finally, the King, on occasion, shows himself to be a skillful political
                            manipulator, and has been able to eliminate many of his powerful
                            opponents following two unsuccessful coup attempts.</p>
                        <p>—This evaluation adds up to a rather pessimistic assessment for Morocco.
                            Another coup attempt seems likely in the near future, and the odds are
                            that eventually one will succeed. The character of any new government
                            after a successful coup is difficult to predict. A successor government
                            is perhaps more likely to be conservative or moderately nationalist than
                            revolutionary, but in any case it would seek to reorder its relations
                            with influential outsiders like France and the US.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Interests in Morocco</p>
                        <p>The options paper concludes that US interests in Morocco are important,
                            but not vital to US security or to global and regional policy
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>In particular, US interests, in order of priority, are:</p>
                        <p>—General Political/Diplomatic. It is in the US interest to have friendly
                            relations with the Moroccan government as a means of furthering US
                            objectives in the Mediterranean, Africa and the Arab world. A hostile
                            government in Morocco could pose problems for naval access through the
                            Strait of Gibraltar in times of crisis, and an increased Soviet presence
                            in the country would be of concern to NATO and the Sixth Fleet. A
                            friendly government is likely to continue to allow the US to use the
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> transmitter in Tangier, and <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="d134-04" facs="d134-04"/>to protect more substantial
                            US security interests described below as well. [Comment: As imprecisely
                            defined as it is, this interest in cordial political/diplomatic
                            relations probably deserves its place at the top of the list. The
                            problem is that it is not clear whether King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName>'s regime serves this interest any better than a
                            possible successor.]</p>
                        <p>—National Security. The United States has an informal agreement with
                            Morocco dating from 1963, whereby we provide training for the Moroccan
                            air force on a base at Kenitra (a “Moroccanized” facility), while
                            retaining full control over two naval communications stations at Sidi
                            Yahia and Bouknadel. Kenitra is large and visible, but not very
                            important to US interests, while the smaller facilities provide an
                            essential link in the naval communications network in the Mediterranean
                            and eastern Atlantic. Because of the presence of the facilities in
                            Morocco, the US has use of 293 Moroccan registered frequencies. Their
                            loss would “significantly degrade” the Navy's communication capabilities
                            in the area. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is planning to complete
                            a Fleet Satellite Communications System by early <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1977, but until that time they view the retention of
                            Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel, but not Kenitra, as highly important.
                            [Comment: The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> view tends to downplay
                            several aspects of the communications facilities and the Moroccan
                            frequencies. First, much of the normal naval communications load is not
                            absolutely essential. In an emergency or crisis, the Navy, without
                            Moroccan facilities, could communicate with the Sixth Fleet, provided
                            that it limited its messages to those of priority importance. In a
                            crisis, the US would also probably feel free to use Moroccan-registered
                            frequencies, even if formal permission was lacking. Second, the Fleet
                            Satellite system could go into effect somewhat earlier than <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 if this became an urgent issue.
                            Planning for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 assumes normal
                            procedures and funding. Third, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is
                            reluctant to admit that the Moroccan facilities can be phased out
                            gradually and relocated elsewhere, such as in Spain. Their own
                            contingency paper, however, indicates that in an emergency they could
                            move to Rota, Spain, in a little over three months at a cost of well
                            under $10 million.]</p>
                        <p>Economic-Commercial. American direct private investment in Morocco
                            amounts to about $50 million (in contrast to French investments <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d134-05" facs="d134-05"/>of nearly $3 billion). US
                            exports to Morocco have totaled about $100 million annually in recent
                            years, while imports have been under $10 million.</p>
                        <p>—Development. The United States has been closely involved with Morocco's
                            development efforts through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs
                            and the Peace Corps. As part of a broader interest in Morocco's
                            stability and friendly ties to the US, we have tried to promote economic
                            growth and some social development. Morocco's long- term prospects are
                            closely related to progress in these areas. The US has an interest in
                            being associated with programs that add to the well-being of ordinary
                            Moroccans, not just to that of the monarchy.</p>

                        <p>The key question for the US in Morocco is how best to protect its
                            interests: by continuing current policy or even increasing support for
                            the monarchy; or by disengaging, at least selectively. The King himself
                            may move against US interests if it suits his political needs, or he may
                            be replaced soon by a government that would ask the US to cut back on
                            its presence.</p>
                        <p>A basic judgment is needed to inform policy choices at this point: Should
                            the US protect against the impact of abrupt loss of its interests in
                            Morocco by hedging its bets and, in the case of the communications
                            facilities, transferring some functions to other locations: or are our
                            interests of such importance and so difficult to assure without a
                            friendly regime in Morocco that we should continue, or perhaps increase,
                            our support for <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>. In the
                            former case, the risk is that our moves toward disengagement may weaken
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and lead him to
                            retaliate; in the latter case, however, the problem is that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> disappears, we have no strong
                            fallback position to protect both tangible security interests and less
                            tangible political ones.</p>
                        <p>The key issues in formulating policy toward Morocco are the US posture
                            toward the King; the US military presence at the Kenitra complex; levels
                            of US aid; contacts with opposition groups; and the <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> presence at Tangiers.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d134-06" facs="d134-06"/>
                        <p>The paper suggests four broad alternatives:</p>
                        <p>—Continue Current Policy. No changes would be made in US official or
                            civilian presence in Morocco and US economic and military programs would
                            continue at their present levels. Close contacts would be retained with
                            the Palace, and occasional displays of special favors for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> would continue. Minimal contacts
                            with the Opposition would go on. This option assumes that Hassan has a
                            good chance to survive; is the best guarantor of US interests; and that
                            any change from the status quo now would be misread by the King and his
                            enemies. On the other hand, this policy would keep the US closely
                            committed to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>, which could
                            hurt relations with his successors; it does nothing to provide a
                            fallback position in case the communications facilities are lost; and it
                            ignores the volatile situation in Morocco. [Comment: Moroccan Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> has already
                            indicated that some changes in the US military presence will be needed,
                            or at least a larger quid pro quo will be demanded if the present
                            arrangements are to be maintained.]</p>
                        <p>—Expand US programs in Morocco to Shore Up the King. US resources, in
                            larger quantities, would go to Morocco to strengthen the Monarchy
                            insofar as outside help can do so: Economic and social reforms would be
                            pressed; displays of friendship for the King would increase. In short,
                            the US would try to seduce <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            into doing what is needed to protect his throne. [Comment: This is
                            pretty much a throw-away option. Very few in the bureaucracy favor it;
                            it probably would not work; and it ignores the squeeze on US resources
                            for aid. In addition, it does nothing to alleviate the basic problem in
                            Morocco—the lack of effective leadership. If the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine is to be taken
                            seriously, we cannot be expected to help Monarchs who are unwilling or
                            unable to help themselves.]</p>
                        <p>—Disengagement. The US would begin a phased reduction in official US
                            programs and presence in Morocco. We would plan to withdraw from the
                            communications facilities by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1975. The Peace Corps and <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> would be cut back from their currently high levels.
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Tangier would be partly
                            “Moroccanized” to decrease its visibility as a US institution. Since the
                            US already has the largest <pb n="7" xml:id="d134-07" facs="d134-07"
                            />presence in Morocco of any foreign country, some cutbacks seem
                            feasible and desirable. The King may even profit by being less
                            vulnerable to the charge of being too close to the US. The danger,
                            however, is that this policy could unravel rapidly. The King might
                            retaliate if he felt we were deserting him. This policy also would force
                            the Navy to accept some degradation of its communications. [Comment: The
                            problem with this option is not so much its underlying assumptions as
                            the implied rigidity of cutting all programs across the board. It may
                            make sense to cut some of the politically sensitive military presence at
                            Kenitra, while maintaining or even expanding non-official programs as a
                            hedge against a change in regimes.]</p>
                        <p>—Selective Disengagement. This policy would begin by reducing the most
                            prominent and politically sensitive aspects of the US presence in
                            Morocco. The communications facilities would be phased out in stages,
                            with full withdrawal completed in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1977. The US would treat the King with usual courtesy, but would also
                            open new contacts with opposition groups. This policy would seek to
                            protect essential interests, without a massive expenditure of resources
                            or heavy involvement in Moroccan politics. [Comment: Recent Moroccan
                            statements suggest that selective disengagement may be forced on us
                            whether we want it or not. Again the question need not be one simply of
                            disengagement or involvement, but rather the mix and the issues on which
                            we concentrate efforts and resources. If the Moroccans ask us to leave
                            Kenitra, this need not necessarily lead to a cutback in all other US
                            programs. There are likely to be some official programs and many private
                            sector relationships that will be welcome under virtually any regime and
                            that would make a useful contribution to the overall US-Moroccan
                            relationship.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Immediate Issue</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> has asked
                            for a review of the US military presence in Morocco. He has hinted that
                            perhaps the three facilities we now have could be consolidated, thereby
                            lowering the US profile. The choice for the US seems to be whether to
                            seize the opportunity offered by the Moroccans to disengage gradually at
                            their initiative, allowing an orderly transfer of the communications
                            facilities to other locations, or whether to pay a higher price to
                            retain the current arrangements.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d134-08" facs="d134-08"/>
                        <p>The options paper stops short of spelling out the concrete choices as
                            they now present themselves. Three specific decisions that could
                            usefully emerge from this policy review are:</p>
                        <p>—A directive to Defense to plan to close down the Kenitra Training base
                            in response to Moroccan requests. All communications functions would be
                            consolidated at the remaining two facilities and would be operated with
                            a low visibility US presence. Until alterna tive communications networks
                            are available, we will try to hold onto these facilities.</p>
                        <p>—Ask Defense to examine the possibility of bringing the Fleet Satellite
                            System into operation before <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977. If
                            this is primarily a budgetary or bureaucratic problem rather than a
                            technical one, a high-level directive should be able to speed up the
                            acquisition of this alternative communications channel.</p>
                        <p>—Ask State to prepare an aid package for Morocco that will conform to the
                            situation following the closure of the US Naval Training Command at the
                            Kenitra base. In return for allowing us to continue at the other two
                            facilities, the Moroccans will expect at least as much aid as in the
                            past. To reach this level, we may need to come up with some new
                            programs, perhaps concentrating more heavily on the development side
                            where the regime is particularly weak.</p>

                        <p>It was agreed that:</p>
                        <p>—- It is strategically important for the United States to maintain
                            friendly relations with Morocco. If it came to a choice, we would
                            definitely sacrifice our communications facilities for the sake of our
                            overall relationship.</p>
                        <p>— The King is still the focal point of authority and we should support
                            him and be responsive to his needs. While he is in power, we should not
                            actively disengage from our relationship with his regime.</p>
                        <p>— We should begin reducing our profile and presence at Kenitra, make
                            contingency preparations for the transfer of our facilities out of
                            Morocco in the event that becomes necessary and in the long term reduce
                            our dependence on the Moroccan facilities.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Gen. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>) Do you want to give your
                            presentation on Morocco?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> is still the focal point of
                            authority…</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know how he
                            feels!</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> then read a
                            prepared statement (copy attached).</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: I have some
                            knowledge of the King and I want to emphasize that he is a very
                            resilient individual. Whatever you do, don't underestimate him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You said that he
                            rules with the support of the Army and then you said he is purging the
                            senior officers. How can he do that?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: His support is
                            based on loyalty to him as the King. It is loyalty to the institution of
                            royalty. Besides, there aren't many alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then why won't they
                            support him more fully?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: Because he hasn't
                            reassured them. They don't know what he is going to do next.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ross</persName>: That's right, he hasn't given them any
                            assurances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it the Navy's
                            turn now? The Army and the Air Force have both had a crack at him.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: No, the Navy is
                            small and mostly-off shore. There is a certain amount of negativism in
                            what I am saying, but the King is the only significant force in the
                            country. He represents the only force with any tradition, and that's an
                            important factor here. Popular support for the military isn't so great
                            either. I would not underestimate the King; he is a very shrewd
                            operator. He has now escaped two attempts on his life, both of which
                            should have killed him. I can imagine that the thought may be prevalent
                            in Morocco today that, “is Allah trying to tell us something?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr.
                                <persName>Ross</persName>) What is your view?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ross</persName>: Well, I agree with what that gentleman
                            (Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>) has been saying.
                            The King, by his highly personal and arbitrary style of rule, has
                            alienated some of his supporters, but the monarchy is still the only
                            strong force in the country.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What should we do
                            about it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ross</persName>: I don't know.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: We'd like to be responsive to the King
                            and supportive of him, but not get too close to him, or too closely
                            identified with him. Nor do we want to get involved in supporting or
                            appearing to support any of the opposition groups that are plotting
                            against him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Have we done
                            that?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: No, but he thinks
                            we didn't tell him things we may have known about the plot against his
                            life. [text not declassified]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that true?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: No, it's not. We are maintaining a
                            policy of friendly relations with Morocco, and we want to maintain
                            friendly relations with the King. If he is going to be displaced, we
                            will continue to support him until that time. Meanwhile, we have
                            interests at Kenitra and it would be prudent for us to reduce our
                            presence there to the extent that we can. If the opposition to the King
                            comes to power, we may not be able to keep our installations at all. We
                            have two choices here, we could begin a crash program to phase
                            everything out by 1976 or sooner, or we could begin a gradual
                            disengagement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is the training
                            base, the one at Kenitra?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: No, it's a communications facility. One
                            plan is that it might be moved to Spain, but I doubt the Spanish will
                            greet an American base with open arms. The Moroccans wouldn't be happy
                            about the base moving to Spain and may pressure Spain not to accept
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why would the
                            Moroccans care whether or not we had a base in Spain?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Well, they may not, unless the “Spanish
                            Sahara” became an issue. In any case, Spain would demand a high price.
                            The King is pressing us to reduce our profile. I understand we have some
                            600 to 650 people currently at Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What about the
                            other two bases?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d135-04" facs="d135-04"/>
                        <p>Adm. Weinel: [text not declassified] There are 450 personnel at one and
                            170 at the other.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: I think it's a
                            good paper (response to NSSM 160), although I think the pressure on the
                            French would be greater than is portrayed in the paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I have no view on that. The paper
                            actually does not suggest any departures from present policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>) What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>: We agree. It may be
                            necessary to do some profile changes at our installations, but above and
                            beyond Kenitra is the strategic value of Morocco itself. We'd like to
                            see a friendly regime remain in power there and we'll alter our bases if
                            that's required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: That's right. We want a moderate,
                            friendly regime in Morocco, and that's more important than Kenitra.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>: We would trade Kenitra
                            for that if we had to, but that is not at issue now.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName>: You know, the Navy
                            took me to Morocco thirty years ago, in 1942, and the objective I was
                            given then is exactly the same as the objective we are pursuing now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Alex (Johnson), you
                            have finally succeeded in changing the Senior Review Group into a
                            ratifying instrument for existing policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I don't know about that. I'll wait
                            until the NSDM comes out.</p>

                                >Hassan</persName>, via an intermediary, has made known his desire

                            wishes to “improve” relations. He is also pressing for a state visit in
                            1973. The two separate purposes of this memo are (a) to seek your
                            decision on handling this emissary and (b) to seek your signature on a
                            NSDM to record the judgments that came out of the recent <gloss

                        <p>In particular, the memoranda at Tab A say the King wants us to know

                        <p>—The present “deterioration of relations” between us is isolating
                            Morocco, leaving no alternative but to turn to the French. Since the US
                            has been a “willing spectator” to several attempts to overthrow the
                            monarchy, it is up to us to reverse this trend. The King apparently does
                            not believe we had no prior knowledge of the August 16 coup attempt.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should send a high-level
                            representative to Morocco to propose “conciliatory changes in the status
                            of US bases.” Once again, the US should take this initiative. During
                            this visit we should arrange to invite the King to the US sometime in
                            1973. This visit would be in the context of re-negotiating US assistance
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>—King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> wishes to send
                            Colonel John S. Canton, USMC (Ret) to visit you at the White House. The
                            King was scheduled to meet with Canton December 26 or 27 to discuss the
                            visit. (Canton was <pb n="2" xml:id="d136-02" facs="d136-02"/>close to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> when he served in
                            Morocco. The White House used him during the flap over Strausz-Hupe's
                            proposed appointment to Morocco.) The King apparently wants him to
                            discuss revision of our communications presence in Morocco as well as an
                            envoy to Morocco and a state visit for him.</p>
                        <p>—The King hopes that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RSW1"
                                >Rockwell</persName> will soon be replaced, and goes so far as to
                            suggest that <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> may have
                            had some role in the two recent coup attempts.</p>
                        <p>This report has been communicated to State and to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Along these same lines, Rose Mary Woods has sent you a memorandum [Tab B]
                            saying that Bob Kleberg (King Ranch, Texas), has recently seen the new
                            Moroccan Prime Minister, Ahmad Osman, and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_OA1">Osman</persName> would like to see the President
                            soon after the inauguration.</p>
                        <p>Comment: King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and his new
                            Prime Minister are feeling insecure and are grasping for reassurance
                            from the United States. Objectively, the relationship between the US and
                            Morocco has not “deteriorated, although the King's own position has. The
                            problem we face is that the present uncertainty and insecurity in
                            Morocco are largely the result of the King's policies and there is
                            little we can do to help bolster his domestic political standing.</p>
                        <p>The King has made it clear that he believes we were somehow involved in
                            recent coup attempts against him, which is not true, and is threatening
                            to turn to France if we do not take initiatives to improve relations. We
                            have no reason to be unhappy with the idea of his turning to France,
                            whatever that may mean, nor can we dispel his suspicions of our
                            involvement in plots against him. What we can and should do is to carry
                            forward the dialogue on our mutual interests begun by Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAT1">Benhima</persName> in New York this
                            fall, especially on revising our communications presence as the King
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>It would seem better for the Department of State to handle this task,
                            however, rather than the President. State had already sounded out Robert
                            Murphy about visiting Morocco as a special emissary to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> early next year, and this seems
                            like a reasonable approach. You may recall that he did this once before
                            in similar circumstances. Our recommendation below is cast in this
                            vein.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d136-03" facs="d136-03"/>
                        <p>AS a general backdrop for any new actions on Morocco, we have prepared a
                            National Security Decision Memorandum [Tab C] for your signature based
                            on the <gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss> meeting of November 30, 1972
                            on Policy Toward Morocco. At this tab you will also find the minutes of
                            the <gloss target="#t_SRG1">SRG</gloss> meeting for reference. This NSDM
                            should encourage State to focus on the issue of our bases and the
                            overall context of our policy toward Morocco.</p>
                        <p>We may eventually have to deal with King Hussants desire to meet with the
                            President but that does not need to be dealt with now. In any event, it
                            would seem best not to be overly responsive to the King's ill-tempered
                            comments relayed through an intermediary or in reply to an indirect bid
                            from the Moroccan Prime Minister through Kleberg.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATIONS:</p>
                        <p>1. That <persName corresp="#p_WLGVA1">Walters</persName> be told that you
                            or a member of your staff will see Col. Canton. Preferably <persName

                            Other</p>
                        <p>2. That <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Saunders</persName> call Kleberg to
                            tell him tactfully that this is being handled through our own contacts
                            and an emissary will be in Morocco soon. We will inform Rose Mary
                            Woods.</p>

                            relations with Morocco. The main point is that we should now open
                            negotiations on the US bases. We would support State in sending an
                            emissary (Robert Murphy) to Morocco early next year to open discussions
                            on the consolidation of our bases there and to reassure the King.</p>

                        <p>Following the meeting of the Senior Review Group on Policy Toward Morocco
                            November 30, 1972, the President has decided that the following views
                            should guide our course of action in the coming months:</p>
                        <p>—Our ties with Morocco are of sufficient importance that we should be
                            responsive to Moroccan requests that we reduce our presence at the
                            communications facilities if this is needed to preserve our overall
                            relationship. To this end, we should engage in negotiations with the
                            Moroccan government at an early date concerning our continued use of
                            communications and base facilities.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to deal with the King as the focal point of authority
                            and should take some steps to reassure him of continued U.S.
                            support.</p>
                        <p>—In addition to reducing our presence and profile at the communications
                            facilities we should make contingency preparations for transferring some
                            communications activities outside of Morocco as early as possible.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>This report was produced by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
                            Aside from normal substantive exchange with other agencies at the
                            working level, it has not been coordinated elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> is
                            expected to break his long silence on plans for the succession by the
                            end of March. The prospects are that the transfer of power, whenever it
                            occurs, will be orderly. Shortly, thereafter, however, divisions within
                            the party-government apparatus may break into the open. In such a
                            contest, economic czar Ahmed Ben Salah is likely to emerge on top,
                            although perhaps within a collegial leadership. The pragmatic and
                            essentially Western orientation of the regime is likely to continue,
                            although no successor can be expected to be as firmly in control—and as
                            outspokenly pro-US—as Bourguiba. </p>

                            </hi>Medical experts believe that while a recurrence of the coronary
                            thrombosis he suffered in March 1967 is probable,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> —now 65—can probably look forward to
                            several years of active leadership. A recent bout with the flu—for which
                            a leading French heart specialist flew to Tunis—caused concern mainly
                            because it came only a week after his annual month's vacation in
                            Switzerland.</p>

                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName> had the National Assembly pass an
                            amendment to the succession provision of the constitution in 1966, but
                            he never signed it, apparently fearing it would reduce his
                            maneuverability. In January 1968 <persName>Bourguiba</persName> said he
                            would announce a new <pb n="2" xml:id="d138-02" facs="d138-02"/>plan for
                            designating a successor prior to the 1969 meeting of the Party's Central
                            Committee. That meeting, twice postponed, is now scheduled for later
                            this month. The impression prevails that <persName>Bourguiba</persName>
                            will for the first time name a prime minister, and that whoever holds
                            that post will succeed to the Presidency.</p>

                            recently, 56 year-old Bahi Ladgham, who acts as chief of State during
                            the President's absences, was considered, the almost inevitable
                            successor, at least for the medium term. Although a colorless figure,
                            long content to live in <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s shadow, Ladgham
                            is influential, hard-working, and a man with few enemies. He would be
                            the candidate best suited to emphasize stability and continuity.</p>

                            has steadily accrued to Ahmed Ben Salah, the young (43) and dynamic
                            architect of Tunisia's planned economy. He heads a super-ministry
                            comprising the former ministries of Plan, Finance, Agriculture,
                            Industry, and Commerce. Last July <persName>Bourguiba</persName> added
                            the Ministry of Education as a mark of special confidence. While still
                            dependent upon <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s support, Ben Salah has
                            placed loyal proteges throughout the government and party machinery. The
                            greatest obstacle in his path is probably the number of enemies he has
                            accumulated among conservatives, businessnen, trade unionists, and small
                            farmers—all of whom have been hurt by his reforms. These elements might
                            well succeed in preventing his selection.</p>

                            other than an interim basis. Tunisia's leaders are not divided by any
                            profound ideological dispute, their competition for power, sharpened by
                            differences in method and personality, could lead to a split when
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> is no longer about to act as
                            mediator. The new succession plan may seek to reduce the possibilities
                            for an open clash by creating some form of collegial rule—possibly by
                            sharing the powers now held by the Presidency with a prime minister.</p>

                            models. Its close ties with the West, particularly France and the US,
                            have proven profitable, and no successor is likely to want to reduce
                            then substantially. At the same time, no successor is likely to be as
                            domestically strong, and as frankly pro-US, as

                        <p>After a preliminary exchange of comments between the two Secretaries on

                            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs first outlined Tunisia's views on
                            the importance of its close relations with the United States and its
                            sincere appreciation for the benefits, political and economic, it has
                            received from them. He then dwelt on Tunisia's preoccupation with the
                            threats to its security building up in its part of the
                            Mediterranean.</p>

                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., recalled that it was President
                            EISENHOWER who wisely tried to stem the Communist advance in the Middle
                            East and Mediterranean by offering the protection of the EISENHOWER
                            Doctrine in 1957. Tunisia was the first country to accept and welcome
                            the Doctrine, but unfortunately President EISENHOWER's objectives had
                            not been achieved, and today the danger in the mid-Mediterranean is
                            greater than ever. </p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Minister referred to the analysis of the situation in the
                            Mediterranean which his father had given to President <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d139-02" facs="d139-02"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> two days before and which
                            he himself had also discussed with Secretary Laird yesterday. Radical
                            countries like Algeria and the UAR, for shortsighted and demagogic
                            reasons, had opened themselves to Soviet ambitions. These countries, he
                            was sure, had not intended at the outset to mortgage their national
                            independence to the Soviet Union, but gradually this was what had
                            happened. It was as if first their fingers, then their hand and now
                            their arm had been caught in the gears of the Soviet machinery. For
                            example, the Rumanian Foreign Minister had told him the Algerians
                            requested deletion from the joint Algerian-Rumanian communiquè of a
                            sentence condemning “foreign intervention” on the grounds that this
                            might be embarrassing to Algeria's “friends.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., warned that while the Soviet Union
                            might at one level pursue a policy of coexistence with the United
                            States, on another level it was constantly nibbling away at the peace
                            and security of other countries, seeking to expand its sway, its power
                            and its influence. This was particularly true in the Mediterranean, for
                            Russia's dream of “warm waters” went back to Peter the Great. The Soviet
                            Mediterranean fleet had to be warned away by Tunisia, something the
                            Soviet Union did not at all appreciate. </p>
                        <p>In answer to a question, the Tunisian Secretary estimated that there are
                            now six to eight thousand Soviet civilian and military technicians in
                            Algeria. When skepticism was expressed that the number was anywhere near
                            so high, he insisted, and claimed that the estimate had come originally
                            from Messmer, the French Minister of the Armed Forces. </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., then expanded on the problems
                            Tunisia faced in its relations with Algeria. As a consequence of the
                            protracted quarreling among Algerian politicians at a much earlier
                            period, Algeria had lost most of its elite, who were swept aside and
                            discredited when the Algerian Revolution finally erupted. Algeria was
                            led today by men of little or no education, many of them (like <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH1">Boumediene</persName>) with an outlook on the world
                            that was five hundred years behind the times. The ingratitude,
                            impetuosity and demagoguery which characterize Algerian leadership were
                            due less to stupidity than to immaturity. The men now in control of
                            Algeria's destiny were simply neither intellectually nor emotionally
                            equipped to provide the kind of rational and forward-looking leadership
                            Algeria so badly needed. They started first by providing the country
                            arms and then grandiose industries for which the country was not yet
                            prepared. Tunisia started by giving its people food and work, and in
                            contrast <pb n="3" xml:id="d139-03" facs="d139-03"/>with the Algerians,
                            the Tunisians were a happy people. Tunisia was attacked for its
                            “moderation” but had too much respect for the real values of revolution
                            to prostitute its meaning in the way others did. Tunisia did its best to
                            have satisfactory relations with Algeria but this was not easy, and the
                            task was made no easier by Tunisia's friendship for the West. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the threat Tunisia feared was from the Soviet
                            penetration in the Mediterranean or from Algeria.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., replied, both. Tunisia today
                            more than ever needed the sense of security that had been offered and
                            accepted under the EISENHOWER Doctrine in 1957. Tunisia has of course in
                            recent years been given to understand in various ways that we would not
                            stand idle if it were ever attacked; but even suppose, for example, the
                            Sixth Fleet came to its rescue in event of overt aggression, the
                            damage—the political damage—would already have become irreparable. What
                            Tunisia needed, rather, was a deterrent. Tunisia had no intention of
                            wasting its resources on a large army and was keeping its military
                            budget within 10 percent of the total, but it should have, first of all,
                            sufficient military strength of its own to make a would-be aggressor
                            think twice. In addition, the Tunisian Government had given considerable
                            thought over the past several years to how to supplement self-defense
                            measures with an assurance of protection from its friends. Tunisia was
                            at one time ready to enter an alliance. However, it is well aware that
                            today the mood of the US Congress is not favorable to new security
                            commitments of a formal nature. There were other ways, nevertheless, in
                            which the interest of the United States in Tunisia's security could be
                            made clear to potential adversaries.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing, he had two proposals to present for our
                            serious consideration. First of all, there should be a complete review
                            by our two governments of the conclusions of the Clowes Report [a US
                            military team study in late 1965 of Tunisian army needs] to take into
                            account the formidable new dangers that have arisen in the
                            mid-Mediterranean in the intervening years. Secondly, it would be
                            helpful if an American firm could undertake to develop the ship-repair
                            facilities at Menzel-<persName>Bourguiba</persName> near Bizerte for the
                            use of commercial shipping plying the Mediterranean. Bizerte was very
                            favorably placed to provide such service, and there could be a real
                            economic benefit to Tunisia; but over and beyond the commercial interest
                            the presence of an American firm would also signify to others US
                            political interest in Tunisia's general welfare and security. If an <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="d139-04" facs="d139-04"/>American firm could not be
                            found, it might be possible to encourage a firm from Denmark or Norway,
                            both NATO allies, to undertake the same kind of commercial development.
                            The presence of either one would have much the same political advantage
                            that Tunisia seeks in trying to enlist our interest. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would discuss the questions raised by
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>, and we would be in touch with
                            the Tunisians in due course. </p>
                        <p>In acknowledging the Tunisian Foreign Minister's expression of
                            appreciation for US economic help, the Secretary of State noted the
                            difficulties we are having with Congress on aid appropriations
                            generally, but said that Tunisia was of course among the favored
                            candidates for aid in Africa, and we would continue to do our best
                            within the limitations of Congressional appropriations.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>,Jr., indicated complete understanding
                            as regards current attitudes in the US affecting foreign aid. </p>
                        <p>The meeting closed on the cordial note which had prevailed throughout.
                            The Secretary emphasized the extremely favorable and well deserved
                            reputation which Tunisia had earned for itself in this country and said
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> valued very
                            highly our close friendship with Tunisia. The new US administration
                            wished to preserve these good relations and to improve them—if indeed
                            that were possible. He knew that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> already considered them excellent. The two Foreign
                            Secretaries looked forward to their next opportunity to meet, perhaps
                            later this year.</p>

                        <p>1. As you have been informed, principal theme of both
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s during recent visit Washington was
                            heightened danger in Mediterranean and threat this posed for Tunisian
                            security. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s saw this danger as coming from
                            dual source—Soviet expansion, and worrisome behavior of Soviet-supported
                            states like Algeria. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s pointedly raised
                            question of current validity EISENHOWER Doctrine but did not press for
                            reply and indeed seemed to recognize that present Congressional temper
                            would not permit new security commitments. </p>
                        <p>2. <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. in his talks with Sec <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and SecDef <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> did make two specific requests:
                            one for US-Tunisian review of conclusions of Clowes Report in light of
                            situation he felt had changed for worse; and other for US help in
                            finding firm from US or other friendly NATO country to develop
                            ship-repair facilities at Bizerte. </p>
                        <p>3. With regard to former <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr not very clear
                            about what he had in mind, although he said at one point review should
                            cover political as well as military factors. In call on SecDef
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. <pb n="2" xml:id="d140-02"
                                facs="d140-02"/>did not cite specifics but gave clear indication he
                            feels Tunisian forces only Qte symbolic Unqte and inadequate to check
                            possible attack. Our impression is that he is less concerned with
                            technical critique of Clowes report recommendations than with engaging
                            new US administration in general dialogue on Mediterranean and North
                            African security problems as they affect Tunisia. Probably
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s themselves have not given great deal
                            of thought to tangible results to emerge from such dialogue but are
                            primarily interested in updated demonstration, visible count public
                            opinion at home and abroad, that Tunisia can count on protection to of
                            powerful US. They may well hope that such demonstration would in part
                            take tangible form of additional military aid, but perhaps of equal or
                            greater importance in their minds are those political and psychological
                            gestures by US which would bespeak continuity and reliability of US
                            interest in Tunisian security and welfare.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr stressed for example that project
                            undertaken by American, Danish or Norwegian ship-repair firm at Bizerte
                            for purely commercial purposes would nevertheless convey important
                            political overtones. </p>
                        <p>4. From our point of view it is hard to see how review of Qte new danger
                            Unqte mentioned by <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s likely to lead to
                            significant <pb n="3" xml:id="d140-03" facs="d140-03"/>change in US
                            effort, military or otherwise, for Tunisia. Tunisian army has not yet
                            fully complied with recommendations of Clowes Report. We do not consider
                            that potential Algerian threat to Tunisia has altered significantly over
                            past two years. As Embassy aware <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has
                            not insisted Tunisia adhere strictly to organizational concepts in
                            Clowes report. Report still considered valid estimate of forces Tunisia
                            could be expected to achieve without undue diversion of resources from
                            economic development effort. </p>
                        <p>5. As for Soviet danger in Mediterranean, this is matter of general
                            concern to US and its Western allies and is not sort of threat that
                            lends itself to specific bilateral action with Tunisia. Indirectly but
                            significantly, as <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s well realize, Tunisia
                            already benefits from presence Sixth Fleet and other Western defensive
                            forces in Mediterranean. </p>
                        <p>6. At the same time we recognize importance <gloss target="#t_GOT1"
                                >GOT</gloss> attaches to our continuing interest and willingness to
                            maintain discussion. Problem is to avoid having this lead us into
                            dialogue which Tunisians would seek expenditures or commitments we
                            simply not prepared to undertake. </p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d140-04" facs="d140-04"/>
                        <p>7. To be responsive to <persName>Bourguiba</persName> demarche in
                            Washington while at same time discouraging Tunisians from spelling out
                            more clearly intentions only vaguely hinted at in call for security
                            review, we would like you now to speak with Foreign Minister along
                            following lines: </p>
                        <p>a. You have been asked to respond to Foreign Minister's suggestion
                            regarding possible review of Clowes Report. </p>
                        <p>b. As we understand it, Tunisian view is that worsening of threat in
                            mid-Mediterranean during past two years may have outdated Clowes team's
                            conclusions. Hypothetical threat dealt with in Clowes Report was that
                            from Algerian armed forces. Our preliminary judgment is that potential
                            Algerian military threat to Tunisia has not changed significantly and
                            that Clowes recommendations for Tunisian forces as valid now as when
                            report prepared. Tunisia has not yet applied number of these
                            recommendations and deliveries of equipment from MAP just beginning, If
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> suggests review Clowes
                            Report, feel this could best be done at technical level with Embassy and
                                <gloss target="#t_USLOT1">USLOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. As for general threat represented by expanded Soviet activity
                            throughout Mediterranean, burden of concern, realistically <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d140-05" facs="d140-05"/>speaking, rests with principal
                            Western defense forces which in effect carry responsibility for
                            containing Soviet threat. While we agree that Soviet expansion requires
                            constant vigilance and that exchange of views between our two
                            governments can be helpful, US considers Soviet forces in Mediterranean
                            still not match for those of West and that latter fully capable of
                            coping with all foreseeable contingencies.</p>
                        <p>d. Favorable reception <persName>Bourguiba</persName>s received in
                            Washington is evidence of importance which new US administration
                            attaches to continuing close US-Tunisian friendship and cooperation. We
                            have taken careful note of concerns expressed by President and Foreign
                            Minister and wish to continue to benefit from their counsel. Tunisia
                            need have no doubt of our interest and desire to be helpful whenever we
                            can. We are interested in such cooperation in security matter and that
                            which took place during recent passage Soviet naval force through Gulf
                            of Hammemet, when we closely coordinated intelligence estimates. This we
                            intend to continue. We do not need to emphasize political, physical and
                            financial limitations on our abilities, for we feel Tunisians have
                            thoroughly realistic appraisal of factors entering into Washington <pb
                                n="6" xml:id="d140-06" facs="d140-06"/>policy consideration, but
                            limitations must of course be kept in mind.</p>
                        <p>8. Naturally we hope to avoid new Tunisian requests and in discussion
                            with <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr you should make clear your
                            remarks in no way imply that Washington will be able to increase present
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> effort or go beyond previous
                            expressions of concern for Tunisian security. Frankly, we would hope
                            exchange of views itself would largely suffice to keep Tunisians
                            content. </p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister and the Secretary spent an hour today discussing
                            Tunisia's security concerns. Starting off with a review of the Libyan
                            coup, <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., said Tunisia was of course
                            against coups in principle as they usually presaged a period, not of
                            stability, but of instability. The Libyan coup as Tunisia analyzed it
                            seemed to be the work of amateurs who must have acted with little
                            advance preparation, for it is impossible to keep a secret for long in
                            the Arab world. They were reacting out of frustration to an
                            unsatisfactory internal situation in Libya, which was probably bound to
                            bring a drastic change sooner or later. The problem is that they seem to
                            represent a mixed bag of elements and probably will not know what to do
                            next. There will be plenty of outsiders—Bathists, Nasserists,
                            Soviets—eager to influence them. Tunisia agreed that there were some
                            hopeful signs and Tunisia, like us, would do its best to get close to
                            the new regime and to exert a constructive influence on it. But odds for
                            success were not high. The Libyan elite from which the young military
                            officers have come has generally been educated in Egypt or by Egyptians.
                            They lack political maturity. It is significant that they have used
                            phrases familiar in the Middle East context but have said not a word
                            about the Maghreb. It is significant that the only Arab diplomat to be
                            received at <gloss target="#t_RCC1">RCC</gloss> headquarters on the
                            first day of the coup was the Iraqi Charge. </p>

                        <p>In any event, while trying to make the best of the situation, Tunisia
                            also had to think of the worst. Tunisia was a small morsel sandwiched
                            between two radically inclined and unpredictable countries. Libya was
                            susceptible to foreign influences and had the means for troublemaking.
                            Radical Algeria had a government increasingly unsure of the support of
                            its people. The very existence of Tunisia as a successful moderate
                            country on close terms with the West is, from their point of view, an
                            unwelcome example. “The race to take possession of the Libyan revolution
                            is on,” said <persName>Bourguiba</persName>. The Algerians, the
                            Egyptians and the Bathists all have their various games to play in
                            Libya, and behind them looms a still larger problem, the Soviet Union.
                            It is instructive to remember, said the Foreign Minister, that “Libya
                            was invented in 1951 to prevent a Soviet trusteeship.” How could the
                            Libyan Government today ever renew the lease for Wheelus Air Base? </p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Government, he continued, knows that it is responsible for
                            its popularity at home and for internal security. By what it does it
                            must earn and keep the confidence of the Tunisian people. It is in the
                            matter of external security that it needs help, for here it feels
                            insecure and this anxiety is shared by the people. In many respects they
                            still lack sophistication and cling to old ways and old ideas. They must
                            see tangible evidence that government policies are succeeding. The
                            public outburst at the time of the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 was a
                            revelation to Tunisia's leaders, showing there are deep wells of emotion
                            that can be stirred up in a crisis. By the same token the Tunisian
                            Government has come recently to realize that Ben Salah's program for
                            putting the country under cooperatives was moving too rapidly for public
                            tolerance. Hence the recent reform and cutback of the cooperative
                            movement and the Cabinet shakeup. </p>
                        <p>The Tunisian people and Tunisia's military cadres must likewise see
                            evidence—tangible evidence—that cooperation with the West is producing
                            military security. Tunisia's officers are not like Libya's, but they too
                            are feeling frustrated, and the government is increasingly worried about
                            them. They have received modern military training in France and
                            elsewhere in the West but see that they lack adequate modern military
                            equipment (“There is not even enough training ammunition!”) and that the
                            Tunisian army is still worth nothing militarily. In addition to
                            receiving modern military equipment, they must also feel they have a
                            constructive role in the peacetime life of the nation, and this the
                            Tunisian Government hopes to provide. Finally, Tunisia knows that real
                            security comes primarily through economic and social progress. In
                            acquiring military equipment, therefore, there is the financial aspect
                            to consider. Tunisia cannot afford to add to its budgetary burdens if
                            this means neglecting essential economic programs. <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d141-03" facs="d141-03"/>With this background,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., said he wanted to speak now
                            with utter frankness; perhaps we would even detect a certain bitterness,
                            which was real. Over the past ten years Tunisia has developed a growing
                            feeling that the United States is pursuing a kind of disengagement
                            around the world. Perhaps this is because the US feels safe with its
                            advanced military weapons and technology and also with the hot line to
                            Moscow. But this does not mean that the Soviets have stopped expanding
                            their sphere of action or that the dangers for a little country like
                            Tunisia have stopped growing.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, Tunisia more than ever feels the need for additional
                            security. Tunisia is not unreasonable in its expectations. It knows
                            about US Congressional attitudes and the difficulties of formal security
                            commitments. But the conclusions of the Clowes report need updating in
                            light of Tunisia's increasingly precarious position in its part of the
                            world, and Tunisia needs more, and more modern, military equipment.
                            Tunisia is by no means addressing itself to the United States alone in
                            this matter. The Tunisian Minister of Defense, M'Zali, has been invited
                            to visit French Defense Minister Debre in mid-October. The Italians are
                            helping with a radar capability in northern Tunisia (the Foreign
                            Minister noted at this point that the US might assist in extending radar
                            coverage to the rest of the country, as radar would have a commercial as
                            well as a military utility). The Tunisians had even detected an
                            increasing Spanish interest in their welfare, and
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., thought he might stop in Madrid
                            on his way home from his present trip. </p>
                        <p>What he had to ask of us now was to reconsider the Clowes conclusions and
                            our present <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program in the hope that
                            our assistance could be augmented to serve Tunisia's needs more
                            effectively. If we could not help, we should at least tell the Tunisians
                            so. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he appreciated the frankness with which the Foreign
                            Minister had set forth Tunisia's concerns. We ourselves were very much
                            concerned by what had happened in Libya. There was no advance notice of
                            the coup, it unfolded as an internal matter, there was no sign of
                            effective opposition, and there was thus no basis whatsoever on which we
                            could act. Consequently we did not want to react adversely to the coup,
                            particularly as no one can foretell just what its outcome will be. We
                            have come to realize from this and other experiences that the US is not
                            really in a good position to cope with this kind of situation and that
                            our best recourse is to maintain a low posture until we can see more
                            clearly how to adapt to the new situation
                                (<persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., nodded his agreement with this
                            reasoning). </p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d141-04" facs="d141-04"/>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that there has been a great deal of
                            misunderstanding about disengagement. Disengagement is a misleading
                            term. All are talking about is that there is a limit to what we can do
                            to sustain foreign governments in power, particularly those which are
                            unpopular with their own people—not, of course, the case with Tunisia. </p>
                        <p>We are simply reviewing our commitments and responsibilities throughout
                            the world to make sure they are commensurate with our capabilities. By
                            the same token we want to make sure that the assistance we give is
                            effectively utilized. It is understandable that the American taxpayer
                            finds it difficult to understand why we spend great sums of money to
                            help shore up a foreign government in the name of stability, perhaps
                            only to have that government overthrown and its country more unstable
                            than ever. In some parts of the world we have been put under pressures
                            almost akin to blackmail. Now what we are trying to do is introduce more
                            realism and efficacy into our programs of foreign assistance. This is
                            the background for some of our recent Asian policy statements, which
                            have attempted to put the responsibilities and capabilities of our
                            nation and those we are trying to help into more realistic perspective.
                            (The Secretary said he of course did not have Tunisia in mind in
                            referring to the weaknesses of our aid programs which we are trying to
                            correct elsewhere. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., regretted that
                            Tunisia some-times had to pay the price for those failings of other US
                            beneficiaries which so irritate the US Congress.) </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said, having given this background, he wanted it to be
                            clear that we were not backing away from our global responsibilities or
                            our interest in the welfare of our friends. In Tunisia's particular case
                            there was a strong feeling of friendship on our part—and we wanted to
                            help where we could. A security commitment, as the Foreign Minister
                            already recognized, was hardly a realistic possibility. It was unlikely
                            Congress would ratify such a commitment. But we do want to show our
                            support for Tunisia in other ways: first, by reaffirming our support;
                            second, by moving from words to deeds that will help relieve the anxiety
                            the Foreign Minister described; third, by reviewing our <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance and doing what we can to
                            help in this area. (The Secretary asked at this point whether there was
                            one particular concrete thing more than any other that we could do now
                            to be helpful. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>,Jr., disclaimed competence
                            in the military field but after reflecting for a second cited the radar
                            possibility.) The Secretary said he understood that Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> and his colleagues
                            would be going into the Tunisian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            question in further detail. </p>

                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by saying that he hoped to see
                            the Foreign Minister in New York and that we were also hoping, if the
                            schedules could be worked out, to arrange an appointment for the Foreign
                            Minister with the President.</p>

                        <p>The President referred to the recent change of regime in Libya. The
                            Tunisian Foreign Secretary said the first impressions of the new regime
                            were not particularly encouraging. Some of its pronouncements sounded
                            Bathist. The coup had happened almost too quickly. Libya was perhaps due
                            for a change but now the danger was that the pendulum would swing <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d142-02" facs="d142-02"/>too far in the other
                            direction. Tunisia had hoped Libya would remain a no-man's land, a
                            buffer zone between Tunisia and the radical governments to the East but
                            now Tunisia had much reason to be concerned. The race for influence in
                            Libya was on - Iraq, Syria, Egypt would all try to influence Libya's new
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>The President asked about the attitudes of Tunisian youth - did they
                            continue to feel strongly about the Palestine refugee problem, for
                            example? <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr, confirmed that the Middle
                            East question was capable of arousing emotions in Tunisia. The President
                            recalled that President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            had spoken to him in 1957 about the problem of Egyptian teachers
                            exported throughout the Arab world. <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr.
                            agreed that they had been an unhelpful factor - Tunisia had never been
                            willing to receive any, and even Algeria found it had to get rid of
                            those it had admitted. </p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said it was
                            unfortunate Tunisia had not been a major beneficiary of the large oil
                            discoveries in North Africa, but he was nevertheless encouraged to learn
                            that Tunisia was going forward with its development. He understood that
                            the Foreign Minister had had discussions with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> about the problem of the
                            Tunisian armed forces. The President said he would like to ask frankly
                            whether Tunisia faced a serious problem of internal security. Was the
                            problem increased by the new situation along the Libyan border? </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. answered that of course there was
                            some grumbling, as in every country, but the Tunisian government kept a
                            careful eye on public opinion and was trying to keep domestic unrest
                            within bounds. Recently, for example, it had “changed gears” on its
                            program of cooperatives because public opinion was not yet ready to
                            tolerate too rapid an advance in this respect. Tunisia was not dogmatic
                            in its policies, but pragmatic.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to speak in candor about the problem of arms
                            deliveries. This was an issue which of course raised domestic
                            difficulties for us. Yet here was a country like Tunisia which had
                            always placed the emphasis on civil authority and which had never sought
                            an arms capacity directed against anyone else. We had appreciated
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s great
                            courage in speaking out forthrightly on the great issues of the day -
                            even when this was not always the popular thing to do at the moment and
                            sometimes not even a matter of direct importance to Tunisia. He could
                            instead have taken the popular and demagogic position. </p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d142-03" facs="d142-03"/>
                        <p>The President said he felt it was important therefore that Tunisia have
                            what it really needs and that the United States do what it reasonably
                            could to help meet these needs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> confirmed the
                            President's impression that the question of additional arms aid was
                            already under review in Washington as a result of the conversation he
                            had had earlier this week with the Tunisian Foreign Minister and that we
                            were hopeful of some kind of answer for the Foreign Minister before he
                            leaves this country. The Secretary added that he felt that the matter of
                            military assistance was important for the reasons already given but also
                            as a boost to the morale of the Tunisian people. </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. readily agreed. Tunisia, he said, was
                            like the piece of ham in a sandwich. The ham needed a bone - a deterrent
                            to anyone who tried to gobble it up.</p>
                        <p>The President said additional arms aid was likely to cause us a political
                            problem here, but the Administration was prepared to cope with it. The
                            President said he felt it very important that the nations of the world,
                            like Tunisia, which presented no military threat to anyone and which
                            were trying to live decently, not be allowed to fall because of
                            inadequate defensive means. Their peoples must have sufficient
                            confidence that their security requirements are being met so that they
                            can successfully pursue their constructive peace-time goals.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented on what he called the terribly difficult
                            problem of the Middle East. He said we know that the Middle East
                            question presents a very special difficulty for those countries living
                            in that general part of the world. We are trying our best to be fair and
                            to find some basis for settlement. He could not be very optimistic at
                            the moment about the outlook, but on the other hand we cannot give up
                            trying to find a solution. If the Foreign Minister found a good
                            solution, he should certainly let us know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. said he would be failing his duty to
                            be frank, as friend to friend, if he did not warn that some of the
                            comments on the Middle East in the President's General Assembly speech
                            today would be badly received by the Arabs. Some of the phrases would
                            seem to them to be leaning to the side of the Israelis. For example, the
                            President had said that the 1967 resolution “maps the way” to a
                            settlement. This would sound to Arab ears like the Israeli thesis that
                            the resolution is only a start. The Secretary said there is quite a
                            difference between a “start” and something <pb n="4" xml:id="d142-04"
                                facs="d142-04"/>that “maps the way”. The latter implies a great deal
                            more about the guidelines for negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The President noted we had already had a complaint from the Israelis
                            about his statement that there should not be any substantial change of
                            the borders. This was a very significant part of his comments. We
                            believe in the 1967 resolution. There is no doubt that there is a lot
                            more to be spelled out and of course it takes two to make an agreement.
                            But the resolution “maps” the trip to be taken. Now it is necessary for
                            the parties to take it. We are trying hard to be fair to both sides and
                            to stay in the middle. We earnestly seek peace in the area and the
                            Tunisian Foreign Minister could reassure his reasonable Arab colleagues
                            of our intentions. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Jr. remarked that
                            unfortunately there were fewer and fewer falling in this category.</p>
                        <p>In closing, the Tunisian Foreign Secretary congratulated the President
                            for the courageous stand he had taken in his speech not only on Vietnam
                            but also on the Chinese question.</p>

                        <p>1. This message contains background material for your use as appropriate
                            in conducting a bilateral exchange on Tunisia with the Foreign Ministry
                            or any other officials designated by the Foreign Ministry. The package
                            contains an internal and external political assessment and a brief
                            review of American military and economic assistance programs to Tunisia.
                            All the material contained in the attachments except Section I (Internal
                            Political Assessment) may be transmitted at your discretion verbally or
                            in writing. Section I is an <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> document
                            and is for the background of briefing officers only.</p>
                        <p>2. As each post is aware, the Tunisian Government, following the
                            September 1 Libyan coup, approached the British, French, Italians and
                            ourselves with a request for help and reassurance. The Tunisian Foreign
                            Minister extended his appeal to representatives of other NATO countries
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. On September 17 Secretary
                            General Brosio convened informally at Italy's request the NATO Permanent
                            Representatives of France, Italy, the United Kingdom and United States
                            to consider Tunisia's demarche. They came to an understanding that
                            Tunisia's concerns should not be a subject of NATO consideration and
                            could be more usefully discussed between Tunisia's friends. Accordingly,
                            Italy suggested a multilateral ambassadorial meeting in Rome and invited
                            the United States, Germany, France, Turkey and the United Kingdom. We
                            demurred, feeling such a meeting could become public knowledge and
                            thereby be misinterpreted, Equally while we did not rule out an eventual
                            multilateral discussion, we felt preparatory bilateral exchanges were
                            required to establish the ground rules and provide some indication on
                            how forthcoming each participant intended to be. France, Germany and
                            eventually Turkey agreed to the bilateral exchange. We believe Italy and
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will have no serious objection. </p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d143-02" facs="d143-02"/>
                        <p>3. Through consultations and an exchange of views and information the
                            Department hopes to accomplish the following objectives: </p>
                        <p>(a) We attach great importance both within and without NATO to full
                            consultations between allies on questions relating to the Western
                            Mediterranean. By focusing attention on one country, we hope to set an
                            example and develop a framework for consultations on other countries and
                            regional blocs within the area. </p>
                        <p>(b) A complete exchange of information on Tunisia to include political
                            estimates and assistance programs is inherently valuable and could
                            perhaps permit development of parallel policy and plans. </p>
                        <p>(c) Ultimately we hope to open better communications and improve
                            cooperation between our various embassies and assistance missions in
                            Tunisia and elsewhere in North Africa.</p>
                        <p>(d) We wish to obtain for Tunisia concrete results in the form of
                            political reassurance and assistance.</p>
                        <p>4. These objectives and specific political and program objectives
                            contained in the body of the document will not be rapidly or easily
                            obtained. We foresee, even in the limited case of Tunisia, an extended
                            period of consultations on a bilateral basis and do not exclude
                            consultations on a multilateral basis perhaps similar to the original
                            proposal of the Italian Government. We would like, as soon as possible,
                            each Embassy's assessment of the interest the respective governments
                            show in continuing consultation and, based on these reactions, we will
                            plan our next steps. In due course the Department would like any comment
                            or reply the Foreign Ministries may make on the information contained in
                            the enclosed document. Specifically, we hope to obtain each country's
                            estimate of the Tunisian internal and external situation as well as
                            details of military and economic assistance programs. In addition to
                            discussing this package in Europe the Department will also go over its
                            contents with the European embassies here.</p>
                        <p>5. We intend to inform the Tunisian Government that bilateral talks have
                            begun. We will not discuss the contents of this message or European
                            reactions to it with the Tunisian Government. We hope the respective
                            Foreign Ministries will exercise the same discretion.</p>
                        <p>6. The military and economic assistance papers are brief summaries of
                            large and complex programs. While general exchanges will be the task of
                            our embassies in the interested capitals with the respective Foreign
                            Ministries, you may advise each Foreign Ministry economic and military
                            data supplied here is brief and more specific information, in depth

                                xml:id="d143-03" facs="d143-03"/>detailed exchanges of technical
                            data, would better be carried on in Tunis between our respective
                            missions. If necessary, we would be prepared also to consider sending
                            technical experts to any capital where such an approach could further
                            the exchange.</p>
                        <p>7. At your convenience we would also like to have your assessment of
                            possible interest of host government in expanded consultations on North
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>8. FOR: Embassy PARIS: In view of the special French relationship with
                            Tunisia, you may assure the Quai we look forward to remaining in close
                            contact as the consultations progress. We continue to welcome exchanges
                            similar to those which preceded the Mzali visit to Paris.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had asserted that
                                “The US is not pro-anybody' but rather pro-peace'” in the Middle
                                East conflict, adding that he had made clear the opposition of the
                                United States to the expansion of Israel in his own December 9
                                speech. The Tunisian Foreign Minister “remarked that indeed the
                                Secretary's speech of December 9 had opened hopes. It was a shame
                                that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s speech
                                about additional arms to Israel had looked to so many like

                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had cabled a
                            report to you on his visit to Tunisia. (Tab A) He was warmly received
                            and seems to have had useful meetings with key Tunisian officials. He
                            feels that we have a “sincere friend” in Tunisia that “deserves our
                            help.” </p>
                        <p>Discussion of bilateral relations was “relatively brief.” Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., did, however,
                            lay “great stress” on Tunisia's close relations with us. The Prime
                            Minister specifically made the point that this was “not dependent on
                            personalities, but was the conviction of the Government.” The Foreign
                            Minister said that Tunisia never confused Arab differences with the U.S.
                            on the Middle East with our basic friendship.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> found the
                            Tunisians preoccupied about the Middle East situation. In a frank and
                            lively discussion with the Foreign Minister and other members of the
                            Cabinet, the Secretary presented our views on the Middle East. They
                            spoke in public favorably about Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>' December 9 speech. In common with Morocco and
                            Algeria, the Tunisians took a position favoring the Palestinians. The
                            Foreign Minister strongly maintained that the Soviets want neither war
                            nor peace in the Middle East and would prevent <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> from establishing peace. </p>
                        <p>The Tunisians are also extremely worried about the course of events in
                            Libya. They believe that the Egyptians are fully dominating the Libyan
                            Government. They were not, however, particularly worried about the
                            French sale of jet aircraft to Libya, since the French had assured them
                            that France had “absolute guarantees” that the planes would not be used
                            against Libya's western neighbors, and, in any event, the Tunisians
                            noted that they could not yet be flown anyway.</p>

                        <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>'s assumption of the
                            foreign affairs portfolio in June, Tunisia has moved quite quickly to
                            reassert its non-aligned standing and harmonize its foreign policy with
                            prevailing Arab and “third world” attitudes, from which it has kept its
                            distance over much of the past decade. </p>
                        <p>We need not regard the change as inevitably unfavorable to us.
                            Normalization of relations with Arab and Third World nations could
                            reduce Tunisia's vulnerability and —-conversely —our need to underwrite
                            many of Tunisia's needs precisely because it has isolated itself from so
                            many of its neighbors and peers.</p>
                        <p>—With the Radical Arabs. The Tunisians have pushed for a detente with the
                            radical Arabs. Improved relations with the Libyans have been the
                            personal concern of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LB1"
                                >Ladgham</persName> and the Foreign Minister. Diplomatic ties with
                            the UAR have been reestablished at Ambassadorial level and plans are
                            underway to send a Charge to Baghdad.</p>
                        <p>With the Third World. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> has
                            declared his readiness to attend the Lusaka conference and his intention
                            to take an active stand on non-aligned, particularly African liberation
                            issues. </p>
                        <p>With the Communist World. In a recent conversation with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName>, the Foreign Minister
                            reported his meeting with a North Korean delegation. While he gave <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d145-03" facs="d145-03"/>no sign of Tunisian interest
                            in relations with North Korea, he expressed his government's interest in
                            recognizing North Vietnam (in addition to the Saigon government which
                            Tunisia already recognizes) and East Germany because of the progress
                            made by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> with the Soviet Union
                            and the East Germans. In addition, we understand the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has authorized the Soviet cultural
                            mission in Tunis to make full distribution of Soviet information and
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p>It is not entirely clear whether the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            really plans to move to recognize the GDR and the DRV, or whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> is probing for a US
                            reaction. A clear statement of West German and American interests could
                            suffice to cool <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>'s ardor.
                            We have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName>
                            to discourage Tunisian relations with North Vietnam and East
                            Germany.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>—in the attached
                            memorandum—would like you to be aware of some strains that are
                            developing in our relationship with Tunisia, a country that has your
                            special interest. </p>
                        <p>The Tunisians are concerned over the appearance of our declining ability
                            to meet their development and security requirements. Last September,
                            after the Libyan coup, you indicated to <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s
                            son, then Foreign Minister, that we would be as forthcoming as possible
                            with economic and military assistance in view of our continued interest
                            in Tunisia's progress and security. The Tunisians considered this a
                            morale boost at that time. However, it is becoming increasingly evident
                            that we may not be able to provide the $9.2 million in concessional food
                            sales nor provide significant additional military assistance that
                            Tunisia requires. In fact, needs in Southeast Asia will require us to
                            reduce our $3.0 million in military assistance for Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia has been a loyal companion since the beginning of our assistance
                            relationship after their independence in 1956. The Tunisian leadership
                            is now looking upon anticipating reductions as a precursor of a changed
                            U.S. attitude. The Secretary feels that—despite some necessary cuts that
                            may have to be made—it is not in our interest to convey the impression
                            that we are backing away from our traditionally close assistance
                            relationship with Tunisia. He has instructed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to press home in Tunis
                            reassurances of our interest and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> plans to do the same when he sees the Foreign
                            Minister at the United Nations sessions. The Secretary also feels that
                            it might be desirable at some future point for you to inform President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> that our
                            reductions—necessitated by our world-wide obligations—will be kept to a
                            minimum to account for <pb n="2" xml:id="d146-02" facs="d146-02"/>our
                            strong interest in Tunisia's development. He is not recommending that
                            this action be taken at this juncture but wanted you to be aware that
                            such a situation might arise. </p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Tunisia is an example of how the small
                            countries often get squeezed when the high-priority ones are taken care
                            of in our military and economic assistance programs. Also, Tunisia is a
                            country which is broadening its natural economic relationship with
                            Western Europe and still needs U.S. aid. The result is that the U.S.
                            spends its money where it is more exclusively depended upon.</p>
                        <p>I share the Secretary's concern about this friendly country's receiving
                            wrong impressions of our policy. In addition to the Secretary's
                            recommendations I am having my staff work with State to see what else
                            might be done.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> will
                            bring with him his #2 in the Foreign Ministry, Abdel-Aziz Lasram, and
                            Ambassador El Goulli. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> has
                            flown back from New York today just to see you. </p>
                        <p>The interpreter, Alec Toumayan, can translate simultaneously if you can
                            arrange for him to sit next to you. [This saves time.]</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> opened his
                            meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            with a 55-minute statement of his views. I suggest you take command of
                            the conversation at the outset by saying:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—You are familiar with what he said to Secretary <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> made the following major
                            points to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—He feels that there is a real possibility for peace in the Middle
                                East but everything depends on the U.S. and Israel. The U.S. will
                                have to press the Israelis to be more forthcoming if there is to be
                                chance for peace settlement.</item>
                            <pb n="2" xml:id="d147-02" facs="d147-02"/>
                            <item>—Any peace settlement must take fully into account the desires of
                                the Palestinians. The Arabs, Israelis and the U.S. must recognize
                                the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and make provision for a
                                “Palestinian homeland” if any peace settlement is to stick over the
                                long term.</item>
                            <item>—He feels very strongly that our presence in the Mediterranean
                                should remain and not be decreased. His main concern is the growing
                                soviet role and presence. </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>More specifically—though he will probably not mention this to you—Tunisia
                            is concerned with the declining level of U.S. economic assistance [they
                            want more PL480 than we have been able to promise] and U.S. inability to
                            provide anything like the kind of military assistance they would like.
                            [They have a shopping list worth $50-60 million, and our whole <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriation for all Africa is only
                            $20 million with $3 million programmed for Tunisia.]</p>
                        <p rend="italic">Talking Points </p>
                        <p>1. We understand the point that President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> and the Foreign Minister have made—that
                            legitimate Palestinian concerns must be met if there is to be a lasting
                            peace settlement. What we still have difficulty understanding is exactly
                            how the Tunisians envision a process that could take Palestinian
                            concerns into account. For instance:</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>—What do the Palestinians want that is achievable? [They say they
                                want a binational Palestine, but that seems unlikely to happen. What
                                can they honorably settle for?]</item>
                            <item>—How do Palestinian aspirations and the future of Jordan
                                relate?</item>
                            <item>—Who can speak for all the Palestinians? Do the fedayeen leaders
                                fairly represent them?</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>2. The U.S. tried to demonstrate in September that it remains actively
                            and intimately concerned with the preservation of freedom in the
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d147-03" facs="d147-03"/>
                        <list>
                            <item>—How does the Minister see European participation in this process
                                evolving? </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>3. The U.S. wants to continue working with Tunisia in the military and
                            economic assistance fields to the extent our resources permit. The
                            Minister understands the difficulties the Administration has in getting
                            adequate appropriations from the Congress. Tunisia should understand
                            that the level of assistance that is possible is not a measure of the
                            Administration's attitude toward Tunisia. [You may recall that the
                            President in his talk with their Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr., a year ago at the

                            military assistance needs.] </p>

                        <p>After exchanging greetings with his visitor, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> indicated that he was aware
                            of his conversation with the Secretary of State and with his views in
                            general. The Foreign Minister then proceeded to cover the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>He explained the role Tunisia had been called upon to play and how
                            important it was for the US to support it in its present role. First
                            called “traitors” by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            because they had advocated calm and reason, the Tunisians had recently
                            seen their position vindicated by <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> himself, who, a few days before he died, had
                            stated categorically that he did not want war and that the Tunisians had
                            been right in the stand they had taken.</p>
                        <p>The growing Soviet presence in the Mediterranean was a cause of deep
                            preoccupation. The Soviets now openly declare themselves “a
                            Mediterranean power” by virtue of the Mediterranean Sea being an
                            extension of the Black Sea. He recalled that a few years ago the French
                            would dismiss any remark about Soviet penetration into the Mediterranean
                            and would refer to that presence as short-term and temporary. </p>
                        <p>He emphasized the need for the United States to focus on the central idea
                            of a settlement and not become obsessed with details. He cautioned us
                            against engaging in a step-by-step escalation supplying weapons to the
                            Israelis because the Egyptians had moved missiles. This escalation could
                            only lead to ultimate folly.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d148-02" facs="d148-02"/>
                        <p>He was proud that Tunisia had been able to introduce a new approach; a
                            new method of work, and that other Arabs listened to Tunisia and
                            responded to this calm approach.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that he had
                            followed every point the Minister had made so far except one. Why was it
                            incomprehensible that we would like to maintain an agreement that we had
                            proposed in the first place and that we had every reason to believe had
                            been accepted by the UAR? When he had first heard of the violations of
                            the standstill agreement he had not believed them because he could not
                            believe that any country would engage so soon in violations of those
                            agreements. He had studied the evidence. The Secretary of State had
                            spent five hours reviewing the evidence and there was absolutely no
                            doubt that there had been massive violations. Thus, why was it difficult
                            to understand that we wanted to maintain this agreement that we had
                            initiated?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister responded by restating his argument on the perils of
                            escalation and on the importance for the United States to view the
                            overall idea of a settlement rather than focusing on details such as
                            getting the Israelis to accept indirect negotiations, to use or not to
                            use the term “withdrawal”; all these were details. </p>
                        <p>Turning to the Palestinian aspects, he stressed that no settlement can be
                            arrived at without a settlement of the Palestinian question. This
                            included secure and guaranteed borders for a Palestinian entity. </p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what would
                            happen to Jordan in this process of redefining borders. The Foreign
                            Minister replied that Jordan would become what it had been in the past—
                            “Trans-Jordan.” He urged the US to be more understanding toward the
                            Palestinians and stressed that in his view El Fatah was the responsible
                            party with whom to open an eventual dialogue.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed regret at
                            having to go to another meeting but stressed how valuable it was for him
                            to have had the benefit of the Minister's advice and counsel. The
                            Minister should be assured that we share the basic principles he had
                            outlined. We also want peace in the Middle East to be established for
                            several generations. We want to encourage moderates like Tunisia in
                            their development without the pressures and the tensions under which
                            they labor at present. We want to work usefully for peace and our ideas
                            and objectives are very very close to the Minister's own. </p>

                        <p>The Minister expressed the hope that on his future visits to Washington
                            he would have the opportunity to meet with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and compare thoughts and
                            ideas with him. He considered this as extremely important and valuable.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> responded that,
                            indeed, his feelings would be hurt if the Minister did not call on him
                            when he came to Washington again. </p>

                        <p>I. DOCTORS BARNES AND MAGAL HAVE EXAMINED PRESIDENT <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName> ON THREE OCCASIONS DURING PAST
                            TWO DAYS AND HAVE HELD LENGTHY CONSULTATIONS WITH TEAM OF TUNISIAN
                            DOCTORS, AS WELL AS WITH MRS. <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> WHO IS IN
                            ALMOST CONSTANT ATTENDANCE WITH THE PRESIDENT. DOCTORS WILL SEE
                            PRESIDENT AGAIN SATURDAY, JAN. 2, AT 5:00 P.M. AT WHICH TIME SWISS
                            DOCTOR AND FRENCH PSYCHIATRIST WHO TREATED BURGUIBA IN PARIS WILL ALSO
                            BE PRESENT.</p>
                        <p>2. BARNES' AND MAGAL'S PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS
                            SUFFERING FROM “INVOLUTIONAL MELANCHOLIA” AND THAT POSSIBLY SUPERIMPOSED
                            ON THIS CONDITION NOW IS ORGANIC BRAIN DISEASE, PROBABLY
                            ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. THE DOCTORS REPORT THAT IN THE PAST THE INVOLUTIONAL
                            MELANCHOLIA HAS BEEN TREATED IN PARIS WITH SHOCK THERAPY (TWO SERIES).
                            THE DOCTORS FEEL, HOWEVER, THAT <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> HAS NOT
                            HAD ADEQUATE DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES, E.G. HE HAS NOT HAD SKULL X-RAYS, BRAIN
                            SCAN, PNEUMOENCEPHALOGRAM, GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST, SPECIAL
                            LECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS, OR SPINAL TAP, AND THAT THEIR LIKELY
                            RECOMMENDATION, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN AFTER THE SATURDAY EXAMINATION, WILL
                            BE THAT PRESIDENT BURGUIBA GO TO SOME UNSPECIFIED MEDICAL CENTER (SUCH
                            AS ZURICH, LONDON) WHERE SUCH STUDIES CAN BE MADE. CERTAIN TESTS CANNOT
                            BE DONE IN TUNISIA. WHILE THEY INDICATE THAT
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> MAY WELL BE MOVING DOWNHILL RAPIDLY
                            TOWARD PROGRESSIVE ENFEEBLEMENT, THEY CANNOT RULE OUT THE CHANCE THAT HE
                            HAS A TREATABLE CONDITION, WHICH CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED WITH FURTHER
                            TESTS.</p>
                        <p>3. THE DOCTORS REPORT THAT PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >BOURGUIBA</persName> SPENDS ALL HIS TIME IN BED, UNDER HEAVY
                            SEDATION. DESPITE THIS MEDICINE, HE HAS CONSTANT INSOMNIA.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> HAS SERIOUS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT WHICH
                            MAY BE PARTLY DUE TO HEAVY SEDATION OR ORGANIC BRAIN DISEASE. HE STARTS
                            SENTENCES <pb n="2" xml:id="d150-02" facs="d150-02"/>AND THEN STOPS IN
                            THE MIDDLE SEARCHING FOR WORD OR PHRASE AND USUALLY TURNS TO HIS WIFE
                            FOR HELP. <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> CAN FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IDEAS,
                            BUT THESE SHOW SIGNS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DETERIORATION.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> IS OBSESSED WITH IDEA THAT HE IS
                            NEARING THE END AND THAT HIS PASSING WILL ALSO BRING THE END OF TUNISIA.
                            HE CONSTANTLY REFERS TO HIS EARLIER ROLE IN UNIFYING TUNISIA AND
                            IDENTIFIES HIMSELF COMPLETELY WITH TUNISIA. HE DEPICTS HIMSELF, WITH
                            ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, AS A MODERN ATLAS HOLDING UP TUNISIA. HE IS IN A VERY
                            EMOTIONAL STATE, TEARS FLOW FREQUENTLY, AND HE FREQUENTLY USES WORDS
                            SUCH AS “TRISTE” (SAD), “FATIGUE” (TIRED) AND “FAIBLE” (WEAK) AND REFERS
                            TO TUNISIANS AS HIS CHILDREN. HE REFERRED TO BEING SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS
                            AND “TRAITORS,” HARPING AT LENGTH ON THE PERFIDIOUS BEN SALAH, AND
                            “DIVISIONS” AHEAD. THE PRESIDENT CONSTANTLY RETURNS TO THE PAST AND
                            EXCULPATES HIMSELF OF ALL WRONGS, AND CREDITS HIMSELF WITH ALL THE
                            POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT TUNISIAN HISTORY.</p>
                        <p>4. THE DOCTORS REPORT FURTHER THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, MRS.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> AND THE TUNISIAN DOCTORS INDICATE
                            THAT <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> SEEMS TO BECOME MOST AGITATED DURING
                            THE AFTERNOON. IN SUCH “CRISIS” MOMENTS, ACCORDING TO MRS.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName>, THE PRESIDENT ASKS FOR A REVOLVER IN
                            ORDER TO END HIS LIFE. HE COMPLAINS THAT HE IS COMPLETELY USELESS. MRS.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED
                            TO CHOKE HER, CLAIMING THAT HE WANTS HER TO DIE WITH HIM. AS THE
                            PRESIDENT IS STILL PHYSICALLY STRONG, MRS.
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> SAYS SHE IS AFRAID OF THE PRESIDENT
                            AND CAN'T GO ON MUCH LONGER. AS THERE IS A DANGER THE PRESIDENT MAY TRY
                            TO COMMIT SUICIDE, HE MUST BE WATCHED CONTINUALLY BY ATTENDANTS. </p>
                        <p>5. DOCTORS BARNES AND MAGAL REPORT THAT THEY ALSO TALKED WITH PRIME
                            MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName> AT THE PALACE
                            TODAY. THE PRIME MINISTER FEELS UNDER URGENT PRESSURE TO ISSUE A
                            COMMUNIQUE ON THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH. THE PRIME MINISTER ALSO WANTS A
                            WRITTEN REPORT FROM THE DOCTORS. THE DOCTORS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY
                            WILL NATURALLY DELAY MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL AFTER THE
                            CONSULTATION WITH THE SWISS AND FRENCH DOCTORS TOMORROW. HOWEVER, THEY
                            ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE PRESENTLY PLANNING TO MAKE A REPORT TO THE
                            TUNISIAN DOCTORS (PROBABLY TO DR. M'BAREK, WHO IS THE TUNISIAN
                            PSYCHIATRIST ON THE MEDICAL TEAM) WHICH, IN CAUTIOUS LANGUAGE, WILL
                            MERELY STATE THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO SOMEPLACE WHERE HE CAN HAVE
                            THE PROPER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. THE DOCTORS REPORT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME
                            RELUCTANCE ON THE TUNISIAN <pb n="3" xml:id="d150-03" facs="d150-03"
                            />SIDE, MAINLY FROM THE TUNISIAN MEDICAL TEAM, TO LETTING THE PRESIDENT
                            GO ABROAD, AND THE TUNISIAN DOCTORS SEEM TO BE THE ONES PUSHING FOR AN
                            AMERICAN MEDICAL TEAM TO COME IN AND HELP TAKE CARE OF THE PRESIDENT.
                            BARNES AND MAGAL SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT INDICATED TO THEM THAT HE WOULD
                            BE WILLING TO GO ABROAD IF THAT WERE THE RECOMMENDATION. </p>
                        <p>6. COMMENT</p>
                        <p>A. THE PRIME MINISTER IS OBVIOUSLY FEELING THE PRESSURE TO REPORT TO HIS
                            CABINET AND THEN TO ISSUE A COMMUNIQUE ON THE PRESIDENT'S CONDITION AND
                            PLANS. IN SUCH A COMMUNIQUE, REFERENCE MAY WELL BE MADE TO THE
                            CONSULTATIVE SERVICES OF THE AMERICAN DOCTORS, AS WELL AS TO THE SWISS
                            AND FRENCH DOCTORS, IF THIS OCCURS, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE
                            NECESSARY BUT ADVISABLE FOR THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE SUCH A
                            PUBLIC STATEMENT MENTIONING AMERICAN PARTICIPATION.</p>
                        <p>B. DOCTORS BARNES AND MAGAL BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST GIVE THE TUNISIAN
                            DOCTORS A CAUTIOUSLY WORDED WRITTEN REPORT. THOUGH IT WILL NOT BE
                            SUBMITTED UNTIL AFTER THE SATURDAY CONSULTATIONS WITH THE SWISS AND
                            FRENCH DOCTORS, THEY DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY CHANGE IN THEIR
                            RECOMMENDATION. (THEIR REPORT WOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THF TUNISIAN DOCTORS
                            IN THEIR CAPACITY AS CONSULTANTS.) THE DOCTORS WILL REFRAIN FROM

                            DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. HOWEVER, BARNES AND MAGAL ANTICIPATE THAT THE
                            TUNISIANS MAY SUGGEST THAT <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> GO TO THE
                            UNITED STATES FOR THIS PURPOSE.</p>
                        <p>C. THE PRIME MINISTER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY REQUEST FURTHER ASSISTANCE FROM
                            THE UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SERVICES OF
                            THE AMERICAN DOCTORS HAVE BEEN GIVEN WITHOUT FURTHER COMMITMENT.</p>
                        <p>D. WE WILL COMMENT FURTHER AFTER TOMORROW NIGHT'S MEETING. THE DOCTORS
                            ARE TENTATIVELY PLANNING TO LEAVE TUNIS ON SUNDAY BUT WILL REMAIN LONGER
                            IF NECESSARY. IN THE MEANTIME WASHINGTON COMMENT WOULD BE
                            APPRECIATED.<lb/>GP-1.</p>

                        <p>1. PRIME MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName> CAME TO
                            MY HOUSE LATE TONIGHT (JANUARY 2) DIRECTLY FROM THE PRESIDENT'S PALACE.
                            HE SAID THAT AFTER HEARING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AMERICAN DOCTORS,
                            ALL OF THE DOCTORS HAD FULLY ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREED
                            THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO ABROAD FOR FURTHER TESTING AND TREATMENT,
                            PREFERABLY IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName> SAID THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WIFE
                            AS WELL AS HIMSELF AND HIS GOVERNMENT HAVE DECIDED THAT PRESIDENT
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName> SHOULD GO TO THE
                            UNITED STATES FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE PRIME MINISTER ADDED THAT HE
                            HAD CALLED A CABINET MEETING FOR THE MORNING OF JANUARY 3 TO BRIEF HIS
                            MINISTERS. AFTER EXPRESSING DEEP APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE UNITED STATES
                            GOVERNMENT HAD DONE IN THIS EMERGENCY, HE THEN SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE
                            UNITED STATES TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CENTER
                            AND IN PROVIDING THE TRANSPORTATION. UNDER SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONING, HE
                            INDICATED THAT THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ALL THE EXPENSES. “ALL,
                            ALL”, HE EMPHASIZED.</p>
                        <p>2. I EXPLAINED TO THE PRIME MINISTER THAT IT WOULD SEEM MORE APPROPRIATE
                            AND IN KEEPING WITH PAST PRACTICE IF THE PRESIDENT WENT TO EUROPE. HE
                            COULD BE ASSURED OF THE SAME TESTING AND TREATMENT FACILITIES IN ANY
                            NUMBER OF EUROPEAN CITIES, AND IT WOULD BE A LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IN
                            EXPLAINING HIS DEPARTURE TO THE TUNISIAN PUBLIC. THE PRIME MINISTER
                            EMPHASIZED THAT EVERYONE WAS IN AGREEMENT THAT IT SHOULD BE THE UNITED
                            STATES; AND THAT IN EUROPE, CLOSE TO TUNISIA, HE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE
                            INVOLVED IN WHAT IS GOING ON IN TUNISIA. DESPITE MY FURTHER EFFORTS,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName> WOULD NOT BE DISSUADED
                            FROM INSISTING ON THE UNITED STATE AS THE VENUE FOR PRESIDENT <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName>'S TESTS AND TREATMENT.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d151-02" facs="d151-02"/>
                        <p>3. ACCORDINGLY, I SAID I WOULD TRANSMIT HIS REQUEST TO WASHINGTON. HE
                            PRESSED STRONGLY FOR ASSISTANCE WHICH WOULD PERMIT PRESIDENT <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName> TO DEPART ON MONDAY OR
                            TUESDAY. I EXPLAINED THAT OVER THE LONG NEW YEAR'S WEEKEND THIS WOULD BE
                            VERY DIFFICULT, BUT THAT, OF COURSE, I KNEW THE <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> WOULD GIVE URGENT ATTENTION TO HIS REQUEST.</p>
                        <p>4. FOLLOWING <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName>'S VISIT, I
                            TALKED WITH DOCTORS BARNES AND MAGAL. THEY CONFIRMED THAT ALL THE
                            DOCTORS, TUNISIAN, FRENCH, SWISS, AND U.S., AFTER MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName>, HAD PREPARED A
                            BRIEF, SIGNED STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY AGREED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE
                            PRESIDENT NEEDED FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF
                            TUNISIA. IN THIS BULLETIN THE DOCTORS EXPRESSED PREFERENCE FOR SUCH
                            TESTING IN THE UNITED STATES. (DRS. BARNES AND MAGAL EMPHASIZED THAT,
                            DESPITE THEIR TACTFUL EFFORTS, THE TUNISIANS WOULD NOT BE DISSUADED FROM
                            THEIR DECISION THAT PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >BOURGUIBA</persName> SHOULD GO TO THE UNITED STATES FOR TREATMENT.)
                            THE DOCTORS FELT HE NEEDED A COMPLETE CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER,
                            THE DECISION ABOUT WHERE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO FOR THIS TREATMENT WAS
                            SPECIFICALLY LEFT TO THE FAMILY. THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NOT WANTED
                                <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY—HE FELT IT WOULD
                            BE BAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS—NOR DID MRS. <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName>
                            AT FIRST, BUT THEY ALL AGREED IN THE END, AFTER CONSULTING THE PRESIDENT
                            A SECOND TIME, THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE WHERE HE
                            COULD OBTAIN THE FINEST EXPERTISE. IN THE END, THEY WERE GUIDED BY WHAT
                            THEY FELT WAS BEST FOR THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT HAD TOLD THEM, “HE
                            WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET BETTER.” </p>
                        <p>5. COMMENT: <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">NOUIRA</persName> WAS ASKING
                            URGENTLY FOR ANY ASSISTANCE WE COULD OFFER. HE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LIKE
                            THE U.S. TO INVITE PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >BOURGUIBA</persName> TO STAY AT A VIP MEDICAL FACILITY LIKE WALTER
                            REED, BUT HE DID NOT ASK FOR THIS DIRECTLY. HE ONLY ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE
                            IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL CENTER WHERE HE MIGHT GO, PRIVATE
                            OR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, AND FOR HELP IN PROVIDING
                            TRANSPORTATION. HE INDICATED THAT HE HOPED AN AMERICAN AIRCRAFT COULD BE
                            MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. I WAS, OF COURSE, NON-COMMITTAL WITH
                            THE PRIME MINISTER AS TO WHAT COURSE OF ACTION THE <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WILL TAKE, BUT AGAIN ASSURED HIM THAT
                            HIS REQUEST WOULD RECEIVE URGENT AND SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION. DR. BARNES
                            AND DR. MAGAL STATED TO ME THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO TO A MEDICAL
                            CENTER WHERE HE CAN HAVE BOTH PSYCHIATRIC AND NEUROLOGICAL CARE.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d151-03" facs="d151-03"/>
                        <p>6. THE MANNER IN WHICH WE RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN
                            MY OPINION, IT SHOULD BE QUICK, POSITIVE AND GENEROUS. I DO NOT WANT TO
                            DWELL ON THE OBVIOUS. <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> HAS BEEN A LONG AND
                            FAITHFUL FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE HAS HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
                            WITH PRESIDENTS <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">NIXON</persName>,
                            EISENHOWER, <persName>KENNEDY</persName> AND
                                <persName>JOHNSON</persName>. HE IS SERIOUSLY ILL. HE WANTS TO GO TO
                            THE UNITED STATES WHERE HE FEELS HE WILL GET THE FINEST MEDICAL
                            ATTENTION. WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT THERE MAY BE ULTIMATELY SOME CRITICISM
                            OF THE U.S. IF HE FOLLOWS THE SAME COURSE AS MONGI SLIM, THERE WILL BE
                            MUCH MORE POLITICAL FALLOUT, IF THE U.S. FAILS TO RESPOND TO THIS URGENT
                            PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE IN A MANNER IN KEEPING WITH THE TRADITION OF OUR
                            RELATIONSHIP.</p>

                        <p>As you know, President <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            was recently at <persName>Walter</persName> Reed Hospital for diagnosis
                            of his deteriorating brain condition and is now undergoing treatment in
                            Switzerland. He is not mortally ill, but there is little prospect that
                            he will be able to resume his duties except, at most, on a part time and
                            largely ceremonial basis. Below just for background are a few comments
                            on the elements in the situation in Tunisia and the eventual possible
                            implications for our bilateral relations. </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Succession Problem</p>
                        <p>Until now in Tunisia political power has been highly centralized and
                            personalized in <persName>Bourguiba</persName>. The people and
                            institutions under him have been of only secondary importance.
                            Fortunately, <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s decline has been gradual
                            and this has given him and the other leaders some chance to focus on the
                            succession problem.</p>
                        <p>At <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s initiative the constitution was
                            amended last year to provide for the automatic succession of the Prime
                            Minister should the President die, resign or become incapacitated. Then
                            in early February, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName> proposed, presumably with
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s approval, a new procedure for
                            selecting a successor. Under the new measures a Presidential vacancy
                            would be filled by the President of the National Assembly for “a few
                            weeks,” during which time he would be required to arrange for National
                            Presidential elections in which he could not himself be a candidate. </p>
                        <p>Other pending amendments to the constitution would circumscribe the
                            authority of the President by increasing the powers of the Prime
                            Minister and National Assembly. They would, for instance, give the now
                            relatively powerless National Assembly the right under certain as yet
                            unspecified circumstances to force the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to
                            resign.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d152-02" facs="d152-02"/>
                        <p>The National Assembly has now appointed a special commission to study the
                            proposals, which are the result of extensive deliberation by the
                            Tunisian leadership over the past eight months. It is expected that the
                            measures will be passed with few if any changes, although the process
                            can not be completed before mid-May at the earliest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bilateral Relations</p>
                        <p>Even if the transfer of power and democratization measures go smoothly,
                            we must expect some modification of the relationship between the United
                            States and Tunisia. Much of the parallelism between Tunisia and U.S.
                            foreign policy and friendship for the U.S. has stemmed from
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> personally. He has viewed the U.S. as
                            a powerful friend in the strategic North Africa-Mediterranean area and
                            one that has stood by Tunisia in its numerous quarrels with the French
                            and has contributed to Tunisia's economic development.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s political heir or heirs are less likely
                            to feel the same personal sense of attachment for the U.S. Moreover,
                            none of them—<persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>, former Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName>, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>, or Minister of
                            Interior Ahmed Mestri—has either the personality or prestige that would
                            make it possible for him fully to withstand domestic and Arab pressures
                            for a more “Arab” policy on the Middle East and more non-alignment on
                            other issues of importance to us. On the other hand, the new leadership
                            is not likely to respond to Soviet blandishments, although any further
                            reductions in our economic and military aid will make it more difficult
                            for Tunisia to resist Soviet offers.</p>
                        <p>In short, a shift in political forces is already underway and with it a
                            change in the tone of our relationship. In this process, the Tunisians
                            may begin to gradually adopt more positions at variance with ours, both
                            on regional and wider international issues. However, barring a major
                            revolution in Tunisia, which nobody for sees, the chances are that the
                            Tunisians will continue to want a relationship with the U.S. Even if
                            they do not, Tunisia can not damage U.S. interests in the Mediterranean.
                            We have no economic interests there and no military interests. What is
                            likely to happen when <persName>Bourguiba</persName> goes is that we
                            will drift into a new relationship rather than finding ourselves
                            precipitated into one.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>You may recall that when the President saw former Tunisian Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Bourguiba</persName>, Jr. in New
                            York at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in September 1969, he
                            assured him that the U.S. would do what it reasonably could to help meet
                            Tunisia's defense needs.</p>
                        <p>Doing this has been a continuing struggle because of the low overall
                            ceiling imposed in the Foreign Assistance Act on military assistance to
                            Africa and the need to recognize that Tunisia's economy will not support
                            a large defense establishment. Therefore, our programmers have had to
                            work at levels well below what the military planners might design even
                            as a minimal defense force for Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>At present, the military assistance programmers are working within the
                            concept of a $45 million package over 5 years—this representing not the
                            amount of money we can provide but the value of the equipment that
                            Tunisia might try to procure from all sources. </p>
                        <p>In the attached memorandum and telegram, State and Defense seek clearance
                            on a telegram informing the Tunisians that we have been able to add $1
                            million to the present $3 million program for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1971. Within that ceiling, the Tunisians would make
                            their own choices between items earlier programmed and new items
                            available, including some M-48 tanks, medium helicopters, mortars and
                            anti-aircraft artillery. </p>
                        <p>The particular reason for seeking White House clearance on the attached
                            package is that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>,
                            in order to make the most of this modest increase, has decided to send a
                            personal message to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Masmoudi</persName>. In that message he would recall the
                            President's earlier expression of “full sympathy with Tunisia's
                            sustained efforts to <pb n="2" xml:id="d153-02" facs="d153-02"/>achieve
                            its economic and social development goals in an atmosphere of peace and
                            security.” The most significant statement in this message is in the next
                            to last paragraph of the message [bottom of page 3 in the first telegram
                            attached to the Eliot to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> memorandum]. This assures the Foreign Minister
                            “on behalf of the President that he remains personally interested in
                            Tunisia's security and that the United States will do what it can,
                            within the limits imposed by available resources, to assist in its sound
                            development.” The statement of personal “interest in Tunisia's security”
                            has over the years represented the extent to which we have been willing
                            to go in response to Tunisia's request for a special security
                            relationship with the United States. This says neither more nor less
                            than has been said before.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you clear the attached telegram with its references
                            to the President's concern for Tunisian security and development.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. U.S. Interests in Tunisia</p>
                        <p>1. Continuation of Tunisia's friendly and constructive voice in North
                            African and Middle Eastern affairs which may in the future be
                            increasingly helpful to larger US interests in the area.</p>
                        <p>2. Because of overall U.S. political and military interests in the
                            Mediterranean, Tunisia's strategic position, flanking the Sicilian
                            straits, is important to the United States and NATO, especially in the
                            event of non-nuclear or nuclear war on a limited scale. Access to
                            Tunisian ports for recreation purposes by the Sixth Fleet has also
                            supported U.S. political-military and intelligence objectives.</p>
                        <p>3. Tunisia's emphasis on economic development offers a market for U.S.
                            goods, services, and possibly, a field for private investment. The
                            internal market would be limited, however, owing to Tunisia's restricted
                            resource base and relatively small purchasing power.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus, U.S. interests in Tunisia are mainly political and strategic;
                            U.S. economic interest is represented largely by the important <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> investment in Tunisian development,
                            which reflects our political interests and the capabilities and
                            intentions of Tunisian leaders with respect to economic and social
                            development and political stability. Our strategic interests are
                            essentially negative. It would be contrary to our interests for Tunisia
                            to be utilized by a hostile power capable of military action against
                            NATO.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. U.S. Objectives Over the Next Five Years</p>
                        <p>1. Maintenance of close and mutually useful U.S.-Tunisian relationship,
                            including frank governmental exchanges on bilateral as well as area
                            matters and objectives. In this process seek Tunisian understanding of
                            the limitations on U.S. economic and military assistance. </p>
                        <p>2. Encouragement of Tunisia's constructive role and increasingly
                            influential position on issues within the Arab and non-aligned
                            world.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintenance of internal stability during a difficult and crucial
                            transitional period in domestic political and economic affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d154-04" facs="d154-04"/>
                        <p>4. Improvement in Tunisia's economic performance especially productivity,
                            through better use of existing investment and resources and with
                            emphasis on agriculture and population control.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased western European interest in Tunisia's sound economic
                            development and security against external aggression.</p>
                        <p>6. To assist in maintenance and gradual modernization of Tunisia's modest
                            self-defense capability.</p>
                        <p>7. Continued U.S. access to the Tunisian market on a non-discriminatory
                            basis for U.S. goods, services, and private capital.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Tunisia's Objectives Vis-a-vis the United
                            States</p>
                        <p>1. Sustain a high level of U.S. economic and technical assistance to (a)
                            make up domestic food deficit on concessional terms until agricultural
                            production increases, (b) provide Local currency and dollar investment
                            in the development program, and (c) provide Tunisia with its own
                            improved human resource and institutional base for carrying on its
                            continued development.</p>
                        <p>2. Seek maximum public evidence of U.S. interest in Tunisian security and
                            obtain enough U.S. grant military assistance to provide a credible
                            defensive capability at home and abroad, consistent with achievement of
                            economic and social development goals.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintain sufficient “great power” interest to give Tunisia flexibility
                            in dealing with its European and Arab neighbors without reducing
                            Tunisia's ability to seek accommodations with them.</p>
                        <p>4. Persuade the United States to move closer to certain Tunisian
                            positions on world issues, especially in the Mediterranean, Middle East
                            and Africa, while maintaining present friendly ties with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Recommended Courses of Action</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Political</p>
                        <p>a. Continue to cultivate close ties and frank consultations between
                            leaders of both countries, <pb n="5" xml:id="d154-05" facs="d154-05"
                            />including periodic visits by Tunisian chiefs of State and Government
                            to the U.S. and high level visits to Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>b. Welcome, in pursuit of larger U.S. objectives, a greater flexibility
                            and influence on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in
                            world affairs, even if this means more frequent differences of view with
                            the U.S. on some specific issues.</p>
                        <p>c. Encourage Tunisia to diversify its political and economic ties with
                            non-communist countries, especially with Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>d. Continue the development of pro-Western internal security forces on a
                            scale related to Tunisia's needs, especially through training.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Economic</p>
                        <p>a. Within the framework of the Tunisian Consultative Group, participate
                            with other donors in providing economic and technical assistance,
                            especially through <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 loans and
                            grants, commodity (program) loans, project loans and technical
                            assistance. U.S. assistance efforts should be reduced as Tunisian
                            production and other donor inputs more nearly meet Tunisia's
                            requirements. </p>
                        <p>b. Encourage additional assistance by other donors, both bilateral and
                            through multinational agencies, and seek better coordination of all
                            foreign assistance.</p>
                        <p>c. Support where useful the role of private U.S. organizations in
                            Tunisia, including the Ford Foundation, the International Executive
                            Service Corps, AALC, and the Voluntary Agencies. </p>
                        <p>d. Coordinate more closely the assistance efforts of all U.S. Government
                            agencies, including HEW, Agriculture, the Smithsonian Institution, and
                            the Peace Corps with the main objectives of the U.S. economic and
                            technical assistance effort, especially in the case of foreign currency
                            programs. </p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d154-06" facs="d154-06"/>
                        <p>e. Attempt to reduce the area of Tunisian commercial discrimination
                            against U.S. exports and to prepare the way for Tunisian participation
                            in the U.S. generalized preferences trading proposal. </p>
                        <p>Encourage the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wherever possible to
                            move towards a private enterprise system, remove restrictions on
                            exports, free its currency, and limit its borrowings for capital
                            projects without clearly defined, economically sound objectives.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Military </p>
                        <p>a. Continue to assist Tunisia within the limits of available resources in
                            support of the new Tunisian defense plan, but at the same time encourage
                            western nations to increase modestly their military assistance to
                            Tunisia. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and donors of military
                            assistance should continue to be encouraged to relate planned military
                            programs to Tunisia's economic development requirements. </p>
                        <p>b. in connection with (a) above, obtain increased cooperation from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in allowing greater contact
                            between U.S. and Tunisian military and in developing intelligence on
                            Soviet military activities, especially Soviet naval and air activities
                            in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>c. Maintain U.S. Navy (6th Fleet) ship visits to Tunisian ports at
                            appropriate levels.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Cultural</p>
                        <p>a. Maintain current level and quality of <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss> programs in Tunisia, with emphasis on periodic high
                            quality cultural presentations.</p>
                        <p>b. Expand the programs for visits to the U.S. by potential leaders and
                            youth and by grants to qualified Tunisian graduate students for M.A. or
                            PhD programs.</p>
                        <p>c. Encourage the teaching of English in Tunisia, primarily through a
                            qualitative Peace Corps program, but also through <gloss

                            SECRETARY, MR. DE PALMA, AMBASSADOR MCKESSON (REPORTING OFFICER), MR.

                        <p>2. SUMMARY: <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName> SAID ARABS
                            LONG FOR CLOSER TIES WITH US AND HOPE US CAN EXERT ITS INFLUENCE TO
                            BRING ABOUT JUST PEACE IN AREA. SECRETARY EXPLAINED US POSITION
                            STRESSING IMPORTANCE OF INTERIM AGREEMENT LEADING TO FINAL SETTLEMENT,
                            BUT POINTED OUT FINAL TERMS OF LATTER COULD NOT BE DECIDED IN ADVANCE.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName> FORESAW CONTINUED
                            STALEMATE WITH ALTERNATING TALKS AND SKIRMISHES. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName> SAID THAT ON HIS RECENT
                            TRIP TO MID EAST HE NOTED GEAT LONGING AMONG ARABS FOR BETTER AND CLOSER
                            RELATIONS WITH U.S. ARABS ADMIRE NUMEIRI'S STAND IN SUDAN AND WANT TO
                            SEE THE SOVIETS LEAVE EGYPT. THIS IS NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL POSITION BUT
                            REFLECTS A FEELING THAT <pb n="2" xml:id="d155-02" facs="d155-02"/>WITH
                            CLOSER US TIES AREA WOULD BE CLOSER TO PEACER AND FREEDOM.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName> SAID ARABS WONDER WHY
                            U.S. DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AND HELP THEM MORE. THEY DO NOT WANT WAR BUT
                            FEAR WAR IS ONLY OUTLET IF THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE. EGYPT WAS
                            DISAPPOINTED WITH RECENT MEETING BETWEEN RIAD AND SECRETARY, ACCORDING
                            TO <persName corresp="#p_MM1">MASMOUDI</persName>, AND CAIRO NOW FEELS
                            CONDEMNED TO DO SOMETHING. ARABS ARE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THE FLOW OF
                            OIL AND ARE PREPARING FOR WAR KNOWING THEY CAN SUFFER MANY DEFEATS BUT
                            THAT ISRAEL CANNOT SURVIVE ONE.</p>
                        <p>5. SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">ROGERS</persName> SAID U.S. CAN
                            DO NOTHING IF ARABS DECIDE ON WAR, BUT THAT A POLICY OF COURTING DEFEAT
                            IS NO POLICY. THE U.S. CAN RE HELPFUL IN BRINGING ABOUT A SOLUTION IN
                            WHICH ARABS WILL GET ALMOST EVERYTHING THEY WANT. OUR POLICY IS QUITE
                            FAVORABLE TO THE ARABS AND THAT IS WHY IT IS CRITICIZED BY ISRAEL. THE
                            PRESENT ADMINISTRATION HAS CHANGED THE U.S. POLICY OF THREE YEARS AGO
                            AND THE ARABS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. WE OFFER
                            POSSIBILITY OF PEACE, WITH ARABS OBTAINING ALMOST ALL THEY ASK FOR.
                            SOVIETS TELL ARABS TO HOLD OUT FOR EVERYTHING THEY DEMAND AND OFFER NO
                            ALTERNATIVE EXCEPT STALEMATE AND WAR. PROLONGATION OF PRESENT STATUS
                            PLAYS INTO ISRAELI HANDS AND INTERIM SETTLEMENT WHICH WE FEEL CAN BE
                            ACHIEVED IS MORE IN INTEREST OF ARABS THAN ISRAELIS. INTERIM AGREEMENT
                            SHOULD BE STEP TOWARD FINAL SETTLEMENT BUT IT CANNOT SPELL OUT EXACTLY
                            WHAT FINAL AGREEMENT WILL BE, OR THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR INTERIM
                            STEP. THE U.S. POSITION IS THAT ISRAEL SHOULD RETURN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL
                            OCCUPIED TERRITORIES EXCEPT FOR SOME MINOR SECURITY ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS
                            THE PROBLEM OF THE GOLAN HEIGHTS AND SHARM EL SHEIKH. SECRETARY SAID HE
                            FAVORABLY IMPRESSED WITH SADAT AND BELIEVES INTERIM AGREEMENT CAN BE
                            ACHIEVED WHICH WOULD BENEFIT EGYPT WITHOUT PREJUDICING FINAL SETTLEMENT
                            BUT THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE IF ARABS ASK FOR EVERYTHING THEY WANT PRIOR
                            TO AN INTERIM ACCORD. AS IN CASE OF BERLIN AGREEMENT, SECRETARY POINT
                            OUT THAT SOME THINGS CAN BE SETTLED WHILE OTHERS ARE NEGOTIATED
                            LATER.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d155-03" facs="d155-03"/>
                        <p>6. MASMQUDI SAID THAT AN INTERIM AGREEMENT WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF
                            THE ULTIMATE GOAL WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PROMOTE ON ARAB SIDE. HE FORESAW
                            LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY PROGRESS UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS AND EXPECTED
                            THAT THE STALEMATE WOULD CONTINUE WITH INTERMITTENT TALKS AND
                            SKIRMISHES. HE THEN RAISED BRIEFLY THE PROBLEM OF JERUSALEM. </p>
                        <p>7. THE SECRETARY RECALLED THAT WE SUPPORTED THE ARAB POSITION ON
                            JERUSALEM AND SAID THAT WE CAN ONLY TRY TO HELP IF THE PARTIES WISHED TO
                            MAKE PROGRESS. IT SEEMED TO US THAT EGYPT WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH THE
                            CANAL OPEN AND SUCH A MOVE COULD LEAD TO OTHERS.<lb/>GP-4</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName>, the dynamic
                            68-year-old leader who has dominated Tunisian politics for nearly 40
                            years, is moving reluctantly toward the end of his rule. Meanwhile, the
                            government and the ruling Destourian Socialist Party are wrestling with
                            the inter-related problems of decentralization of power and orderly
                            presidential succession.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago, while recovering from a severe bout of viral hepatitis,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> faced a serious, and for him
                            traumatic, crisis in which he had to reverse his agricultural policy.

                                n="3" xml:id="d156-03" facs="d156-03"/>are circumscribed and closely
                            monitored by his doctors. At best, his health is precarious, and he must
                            pace his activities and avoid deep personal involvement in the daily
                            affairs of government and party.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s rule has been pragmatic, paternalistic,
                            highly personal, and autocratic. He wants to ensure a niche in history
                            as the creator of a stable and respected nation-state. For the past
                            decade he has time and again vacillated over the succession problem, but
                            he has been reluctant to relax the reins of authority.</p>
                        <p>Many Tunisians leaders are well-schooled in the
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> philosophy and should by able to
                            govern effectively; competition among candidates for succession is seen
                            as they maneuver for political backing. All are basically pro-West, but
                            none so openly aligns himself with the US as

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Assessing Tunisia's body politic requires insight into the personality
                            of its chief architect, who calls himself the “supreme combatant.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib Bourguiba</persName> was born in
                            1903 at Monastir in the heart of the Sahel, a rich agricultural plain of
                            eastern Tunisia which produced most of the country's pre-independence
                            political leaders, bureaucrats, and intellectuals. He entered politics
                            in the late 1920s after completing his education in French schools in
                            Tunis and France. With other young intellectuals, almost all educated in
                            France, he sought to revitalize the nationalist, but cautious, Destour
                            (constitution) party that represented the interests of the small
                            Tunisian bourgeoisie and landed gentry.</p>
                        <p>2. These efforts failed, and in 1934 <persName>Bourguiba</persName> and
                            his peers broke away from the Destour to form the Neo-Destour party, now
                            called the Destourian Socialist Party. The new party sought a mass,
                            rather than a select, membership. During his first 20 years, the party
                            was more often than not suppressed and, operating clandestinely, evolved
                            into a highly disciplined organization. In 1938
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> became the second president of the
                            party, but spent most of the years until 1956 in prison or in exile.</p>
                        <p>3. France's policy of repressing Tunisian nationalism was modified in
                            1954. From his prison cell, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> welcomed
                            Premier Mendes-France's promise of self-government.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s counsel to the Tunisian team during
                            the arduous negotiations resulted in Tunisia's acceptance of limited
                            autonomy, an admitted half loaf but better than none to
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>. He was permitted to return home in
                            mid-1955 to a hero's welcome. Nine months later, after Morocco had
                            gained independence, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> persuaded France to
                            give Tunisia its independence also. He became the first
                            post-independence prime minister, and in July 1957, when the constituent
                            assembly proclaimed Tunisia a republic, he was selected as the country's
                            provisional president. Since the constitution was adopted in 1959,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has been <pb n="5" xml:id="d156-05"
                                facs="d156-05"/>re-elected for three five-year terms. His present
                            and constitutionally last term expires in November 1974; he is publicly
                            committed to retire at that time.</p>
                        <p>4. When <persName>Bourguiba</persName> took charge of the-government in
                            April 1956, he faced the familiar problems of any small country with few
                            natural resources. Most of Tunisia's wealth was held by foreigners. The
                            vast majority of its 3.5 million people was illiterate and existed at
                            subsistence level. A rebellion against foreign rule in Algeria that
                            raged along Tunisia's western border brought serious problems; armed
                            Algerian guerrillas who took refuge in Tunisia and hundreds of thousands
                            of Algerian refugees. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s open resistance
                            to the extension of Nasir's influence into North Africa, his avowedly
                            anti-Communist position, and his outspoken support of the West were
                            politically hazardous in the milieu of a newly independent Arab country.
                            Faced with profound ignorance, poverty, xenophobia, and the opposition
                            of Pan-Arabists and religious traditionalists,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> sought to improve living
                            conditions—particularly housing—expand and modernize education, train
                            cadres for both business and government, create more efficient public
                            and private enterprises, modernize and diversify agriculture, and
                            improve the quality of family life and the status of women.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bourguibism</p>
                        <p>“Bourguibism accepts the battle when forced to do so and is always
                            victorious.” —<persName>Bourguiba</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s philosophy of government has been
                            strongly influenced by his French education and early association with
                            European socialists and liberals. Basically a humanist, he rejected
                            Marxism and embraced a socialism designed to promote the
                            self-development of individuals. His avowed goal is the creation of a
                            fundamentally egalitarian and modern society, a “showcase of
                            democracy.”</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d156-06" facs="d156-06"/>
                        <p>6. In pursuit of this goal he has confronted the entrenched interests of
                            foreign businesses and landowners, and the rich and powerful Tunisian
                            families of the royal court. His programs to modernize Tunisian society
                            have frequently run counter to Islamic practices and have often been
                            greeted with suspicion, superstition, or apathy by the impoverished and
                            ignorant. He restrained supporters who wanted to expel all foreigners.
                            In maintaining a balance between divergent pressures,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> employed the techniques he had used
                            in winning independence—to press forward; to be conciliatory, persuasive
                            and patient; and if necessary, to back off until he could go forward
                            again.</p>
                        <p>7. Although he publicly advocates democracy,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> in fact has maintained tight control
                            over the government and party, making all major and many minor decisions
                            and appointments. Tunisian democracy, he explains, must be guided
                            carefully because the people still are politically immature. [<hi

                            efficiency has suffered, and the party has lost much of its earlier
                            vitality. Both government and party have had difficulty in attracting
                            intellectuals and youth.</p>

                        <p>8. Since independence, party and state have for all practical purposes
                            been synonymous; key party leaders have held the key offices in both the
                            party's executive body—the political bureau—and the government. Many
                            party leaders particularly at the local and regional level had initially
                            been elected to office. As time went on <persName>Bourguiba</persName>
                            began to select them himself. Dissent was discouraged. Anyone who
                            persisted in opposing or failed to execute a specific policy could
                            expect dismissal from the government and the party. Although no formal
                            censorship has been instituted, the press and the other news media have
                            become uniformly uncritical of <persName>Bourguiba</persName> and those
                            surrounding him. When the press speaks harshly of an official, it is
                            likely that he is either facing early oblivion or has already been
                            dismissed.</p>
                        <p>9. The cliques that are common within the monolithic political structure
                            generally follow regional, ideological, and generation lines. The two
                            dominant regional divisions are the Sahelians—inhabitants of the coastal
                            area of eastern Tunisia where the party was formed and which supplied
                            the early cadre—and the Tunisois—people born and living in or near the
                            capital. The ideological split is between the conservatives
                            (absolutists) who favor the retention of a strong, centralized authority
                            and a controlled economy, and the liberals (reformists) who call for a
                            more democratic party and government, relaxation of controls, and a
                            freer economy. A generation gap exists between members of the party who
                            were active in the thirties and forties and were imprisoned for their
                            political activities and members born after about 1935. The older ones
                            tend to be Sahelians and conservatives; the younger, Tunisois and
                            liberal.</p>
                        <p>10. Since independence nearly 16 years ago, a whole new generation of
                            Tunisians, better educated than their fathers, have entered the ranks of
                            the party and bureaucracy. Most of them chafe under the regime's
                            authoritarian and paternalistic practices. Many who supported the theory
                            behind the <pb n="8" xml:id="d156-08" facs="d156-08"/>formation of
                            business, service and agricultural cooperatives begun during the 1960s
                            were troubled by the fact many cooperatives were imposed without the
                            consent of the participants.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">AHMED MESTIRI</persName>, a member of this
                            new generation, is the most prominent of Tunisia's liberals. He made his
                            initial bid to rally support against forced cooperativization in January
                            1968. He was able to elicit only limited backing and publicly resigned
                            as secretary of state for defense to dramatize his opposition. He was
                            expelled from the party. Two years later, after the imposition of
                            agricultural cooperatives was stepped up and aroused such widespread
                            opposition that the policy had to be dropped, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Mestiri</persName> was reintegrated into the party. He then helped
                            formulate the program of expanding the authority of government and
                            assembly announced by <persName>Bourguiba</persName> in June 1970. As
                            executive secretary of the party's Superior Commission which was charged
                            with drafting constitutional amendments and preparing for the
                            quinquennial congress this fall, he was in an excellent position to
                            press for changes in the system.</p>
                        <p>12. When the 1,000-member party congress was finally held in October, a
                            groundswell of support for more democracy in the party and government
                            became evident. After unexpectedly free discussion the delegates elected
                            liberals to fill a majority of seats in the party's 58-member central
                            committee. It was clear that most of the delegates were seeking new
                            institutions and the free election of his successor when the ailing
                            President steps down.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, however, backed by the Sahelian
                            conservative minority, blocked this trend. Although a majority of the
                            delegates had endorsed a proposal to change the existing procedure by
                            which the prime minister would succeed to the presidency in the event of
                            a vacancy, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> announced that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> was his choice as
                            successor. <pb n="9" xml:id="d156-09" facs="d156-09"/>In spite of the
                            clear consensus that the congress should elect the political bureau, the
                            President announced he intended to appoint its members. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Mestiri</persName> aired his frustrations to the
                            foreign press, and <persName>Bourguiba</persName> suspended him from
                            party activities. Ultimately <persName>Bourguiba</persName> submitted a
                            handpicked slate of 20 candidates to the central committee from which it
                            elected the 14-man political bureau. The result was a largely
                            conservative body. Even some liberals have criticized Mestiri for
                            committing the unpardonable sin of discussing internal affairs with
                            foreign press representatives. He will have to appear before a party
                            disciplinary committee.</p>
                        <p>14. Despite the victory over the liberals, the ruling
                            politicians—including <persName>Bourguiba</persName>—cannot be
                            completely insensitive to the pressures for change. The liberals still
                            have two forums—the party's central committee and the National
                            Assembly—and they can be expected to make full use of both. Most
                            prominent liberals will continue to work for evolutionary change,
                            expecting that over the next year or so many of the propositions they
                            support will be adopted.</p>
                        <p>15. By doggedly clinging to the status quo, the conservatives may see
                            their fortunes decline still further. A leading conservative,
                            38-year-old MOHAMED SAYAH, [text not declassified] a member of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> government and reputed
                            to be a current favorite of <persName>Bourguiba</persName>, Sayah failed
                            to be elected to the central committee and therefore was not eligible
                            for selection to the political bureau. Should
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> die or his term expire coincident
                            with an expansion of liberal influence, the conservatives might try to
                            seize power. Sayah is the only Tunisian now prominent who seems ruthless
                            enough to attempt a power grab.</p>

                        <p>16. Dissident groups outside the power structure are too small,
                            disparate, and disorganized to exert much influence on political
                            developments or to pose more than a remote threat to the country's
                            stability. Followers of Salah ben Youssef, expelled from the party in
                            1955 and murdered in 1961—presumably on <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s
                            orders—have long been actively plotting from exile to upset the
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> regime. There are also a few
                            adherents of Marxism, Trotskyism, Maoism, and various Pan-Arab
                            movements. The small Tunisian Communist party, banned since 1963, has an
                            estimated 100 members. Most political exiles eke out a living from small
                            and diminishing foreign subsidies, occasional handouts from
                            sympathizers, or what wages they can earn in an uncertain labor
                            market.</p>
                        <p>17. Islam exerts a subtle moral influence in Tunisia. While emphasizing
                            Muslim moral values, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has consistently
                            sought to eliminate religious customs that impede economic
                            modernization. His efforts have been but partially successful. His
                            campaign to downgrade the strict observance of Ramadan, the economically
                            unproductive Moslem month of daytime fasting and nighttime feasting (he
                            labeled it a luxury a developing nation could ill afford) has
                            antagonized the country's religious leaders and been openly resisted by
                            most Tunisians. Religious support is not likely to be a vital factor in
                            any power struggle, however.</p>
                        <p>18. The backing of the generally apolitical military and security forces
                            is crucial to any Tunisian government. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>
                            and other authorities have been careful to isolate the military from
                            politics. Despite his efforts to insulate the military from politics the
                            cleavage between liberal and conservative factions has to some extent

                            generally favoring the conservatives and junior officers being
                            sympathetic toward the liberals.</p>

                        <p>19. Students, traditionally the most fractious element of Tunisian
                            society, are a most likely source of disaffection and discord. Most
                            students have resisted party control over the student union. During the
                            annual student union congress in August, a majority of the
                            delegates—including some Destourians, leftists, Communists, and Arab
                            nationalists—formed a “Democratic Front” which unsuccessfully tried to
                            take control of the organization. The new leaders, imposed by the
                            minority, can be expected to adhere to party direction, but there is a
                            real question how much of a following the organization will command
                            among the university students this year. In an effort to forestall
                            potential troubles within the university, <persName corresp="#p_NHA1"
                                >Nouira</persName> entered into a dialogue with student and youth
                            leaders immediately after the party congress.</p>

                            artisan of its unity disappears (as the King of France disappeared after

                        <p>20. The overriding political issue of the day is presidential succession.
                            For more than a decade, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has frequently
                            referred to his mortality, but has vacillated about what procedure
                            should be followed in selecting a successor. In 1969
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName>
                            <pb n="12" xml:id="d156-12" facs="d156-12"/>created the post of prime
                            minister and named his longtime associate, <persName corresp="#p_LB1"
                                >BAHI LADGHAM</persName>, to fill it. The National Assembly
                            subsequently amended the constitution to provide that the prime minister
                            succeed in the event of a presidential vacancy.</p>
                        <p>21. By June 1970 <persName>Bourguiba</persName> had laid down the broad
                            outlines for constitutional revision, but he changed his mind again. He
                            proposed that the Superior Commission of the party study the possibility
                            of creating a post of vice president or of providing for the temporary
                            succession of the president of the National Assembly to the presidency.
                            That fall, he told an audience that he did not want to know who was
                            going to succeed him and that his successor should be elected. A few
                            days later he had dismissed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LB1"
                                >Ladgham</persName> and named another long-time associate, Hedi
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>, as prime minister.
                            Since then, <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has frequently expressed full
                            confidence in <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>. He told the
                            recent congress that <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>
                            should be his successor, adding that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> and former interior minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Mestiri</persName> could wait their turn.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> also told the party congress that he
                            would not seek re-election when his term expires. But he recently
                            informed an American news correspondent that if his health permitted he
                            would run again in 1974.</p>
                        <p>22. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s interventions on the succession
                            problem have complicated and delayed a solution. The liberals are likely
                            to be more determined than ever that the constitution be amended to
                            provide for an elected successor, while the conservatives will no doubt
                            continue to support <persName>Bourguiba</persName>. Meanwhile, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName>, although attempting to hew a
                            neutral course, has lost his status as an arbiter.</p>
                        <p>23. Another controversial issue involves the authority of the National
                            Assembly. The liberals and conservatives agree that Tunisia should
                            retain a strong presidential system in which the president <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="d156-13" facs="d156-13"/>establishes the broad outlines of
                            policy. They also agree that the government, appointed and responsible
                            to the President, should also be accountable to the National Assembly.
                            They disagree over a proposal giving the National Assembly the right to
                            censure the government. Only the liberal faction wants this.</p>
                        <p>24. A third issue is the relationship between the party and the various
                            national organizations: labor, students, youth, women, artisans and
                            agriculturalists. Most, if not all, of these groups have during the past
                            decade been brought under tight party supervision and control. The labor
                            and student groups, in particular, have resisted party domination and,
                            reflecting the strong popular desire for more democracy within the
                            government and party, may resume pressure for greater autonomy. There
                            will also be demands for a complete restructuring of the party as
                            outlined by <persName corresp="#p_NHA1">Nouira</persName> last year. At
                            that time he indicated that local units, or cells, would be represented
                            at all levels of the party hierarchy and that party decisions would be
                            made democratically, not dictated from the top.</p>
                        <p>25. The possibility of a multiparty political system was raised by the
                            Superior Commission last year, but apparently has been shelved. Tunisia
                            has had only one party since the small Communist Party was banned in
                            1963. <persName>Bourguiba</persName> and most party leaders continue to
                            justify the one-party system on the ground that Tunisia, a poor nation,
                            cannot afford competition between rival organizations. The watchword is
                            still national unity within a single-party system.</p>

                        <p>26. <persName>Bourguiba</persName> is a part-time president, his
                            government a lame duck regime. Presidential hopefuls are already
                            jockeying for position. Conservatives will almost certainly strive to
                            forestall any change in the present constitutional provisions for
                            presidential succession, at least until <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s
                            present term expires in November 1974. The liberal faction will work for
                            institutions that will preclude another authoritarian leader.</p>
                        <p>27. <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s successor under present
                            constitutional arrangements is HEDI nouira. The President's designated

                            received his university education in Paris. As a student, he joined the

                            Socialist Party both before and after independence. <persName

                            Bitterness over his demotion from prime minister and party chairmanship
                            may have been somewhat sweetened by demonstrations of support he
                            received at the party congress when he obtained the greatest number of
                            votes of any candidate for the party's central committee. The President
                            did not propose his name for the political bureau, reportedly at
                                <persName corresp="#p_LB1">Ladgham</persName>'s own request. </p>

                            independence, he has twice so antagonized the president that <persName

                            openly criticized the developing “cult of personality.” The fact that

                            affairs of his ministry and again in 1968 when he openly opposed the
                            government's economic program. In 1968 he was expelled <pb n="17"

                            two years later. He was dismissed as minister of the interior in early
                            September because he objected to <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s

                            activity a few days later for making “seditous” statements to the

                            elected to the party's central committee in October, he holds no

                        <p>34. Although the President's only son, <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Habib
                                Bourguiba</persName> JR., has no personal political support, he
                            cannot be discounted entirely as a presidential contender. In the right
                            political atmosphere, he might be chosen to succeed his father.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. has served as a member of the
                            Superior Commission and was elected to the party's central committee.
                            The 44-year-old former foreign minister was born and educated in France
                            and has had wide diplomatic experience. As the President-Director
                            General of the National Investment Company, he is acquiring economic and
                            financial experience. <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. has had several
                            sharp differences with his father. In 1961-62 he strongly protested his
                            father's unpopular divorce and subsequent marriage to his longtime
                            mistress. Recently he unsuccessfully sought to moderate the President's
                            vindictive attitude toward former economic czar Ahmed Ben Salah.
                            Although <persName>Bourguiba</persName> Jr. was a hard-working and
                            effective foreign minister, he is reputed to be something of a
                            playboy.</p>

                            faction. Because of his effectiveness as minister of interior and
                            minister of defense he has gained a solid reputation as a capable
                            administrator. While he headed these ministries, he may have acquired
                            some following within the security and military establishments. As a
                            former student leader of the post-World War II era in France and as a
                            participant in pre-independence negotiations <pb n="19" xml:id="d156-19"

                            ties. He is reported to have resigned his present post as ambassador to
                            France to protest <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s rejection of the
                            consensus at the party's recent congress. He has nevertheless long been
                            close to the President.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli said that he was calling to express his deep
                            personal thanks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> for
                            all that he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            did in arranging for him to deliver personally to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> the letter from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>. El Goulli said that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> received him with
                            special warmth, emphasizing that President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> was his good friend. </p>
                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli said that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s willingness to receive him, even though he was
                            busy preparing for his trip to Peking, constituted a symbolic gesture
                            which would be very important to President <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>. El Goulli said that it was clear in his brief
                            conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, that the President understands President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName>'s concern for security in the
                            Mediterranean and in North Africa, especially the problem of Soviet
                            infiltration. (El Goulli remarked parenthetically that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has been kept fully
                            advised by the White House staff of <persName>Bourguiba</persName>'s
                            concerns.) </p>
                        <p>Internal Security. El Goulli said that his welcome at the White House
                            demonstrates that there is good will toward Tunisia here in Washington.
                            In this connection the Ambassador expressed hope that the US would be
                            able to provide help in response to Tunisia's request for internal
                            security assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            stressed that there is indeed good will in the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> toward its friends. He noted, however, that there is a
                            growing problem in how the US can manifest this goodwill when its means
                            to help are more limited. For example, the Congress has removed from the
                            assistance bill all proposed authorizations for public safety. In these
                            circumstances, requests for internal security assistance raise some very
                            difficult problems. As for Tunisia's request, we expect to know in the
                            next few days how we might best resolve our mutual problems. </p>
                        <p>Military Assistance. The Ambassador raised the question of military
                            assistance; expressing hope that beyond what was provided by the US last
                            year, Tunisia would receive more in the future. El Goulli said that it
                            was generally understood when the US assistance package was delivered in
                            the Spring of 1971 that Tunisia would continue to receive help. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that the US would
                            certainly do what it could to help. He noted, however, that at the
                            present time there is a difference of about $50 million in the amounts
                            of overall, world-wide military assistance that the Senate and the House
                            are prepared to provide. Given existing US commitments in Indo-China,
                            should the lesser amount be approved, there would be difficult problems.
                            El Goulli said that he fully understood this problem but expressed hope
                            that since Tunisia's needs are so small—perhaps only a few million
                            dollars—the US would be able to find a way to help. He suggested that
                            since there are already several assistance programs in Tunisia, perhaps
                            some mutually advantageous arrangement could be worked out. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> agreed that we should
                            try to match our mutual possibilities. He added that the Ambassador
                            should be assured that Tunisia will remain one of the five countries in
                            Africa which will continue to receive military assistance - the precise
                            amount to be worked out here in Washington, considering overall
                            availabilities, etc. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> concluded by informing
                            El Goulli that the serious problems affecting the overall US assistance
                            effort would require the US to inform its friends that it could no
                            longer do as much as it has done in the past. This could, if
                            misunderstood, perhaps lead our friends to question whether there might
                            be changes in our basic attitude toward them. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> stressed that our friends should
                            understand that the issue is not one of basic relationships but of
                            resources.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that he wished to
                            convey certain decisions that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            has reached concerning several recent requests by Tunisia for
                            assistance, particularly the request for internal security assistance.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that only
                            after a very thorough and time-consuming examination of all the possible
                            alternatives involved, was it possible to arrive at these decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> frankly informed
                            Ambassador El Goulli that the means of the USG to provide assistance in
                            the internal security field have become very limited. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that in the months that
                            have passed since officers of our Embassy in Tunis met with Tunisian
                            officials to reduce the internal security request to its most essential
                            elements; an important element of Congress has been revealed that it is
                            against public safety assistance. He referred to the Senate's recent
                            amendment to the appropriation bill proposing that public safety
                            programs be limited to financing from security assistance funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that while every
                            effort was made to respond in a positive way to the Tunisian request,
                            given the mood of Congress, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has
                            concluded that it cannot provide assistance to Tunisia in the area of
                            internal security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            assured Ambassador El Goulli that the U.S. remains very interested in
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d158-02" facs="d158-02"/>Tunisia and will continue
                            to make a substantial effort to assist in Tunisia's development. In this
                            connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> informed
                            El Goulli that the US is prepared to demonstrate its special friendship
                            for Tunisia by considering the addition of $1 million to the
                            Agricultural Sector Loan now being developed in <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> referred to the recent
                            US decision to open negotiations in Tunis on the addition of 60,000 tons
                            of wheat and 10,000 tons of soybean oil to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1972 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I
                            Agreement. The value of these additions is about $4 million. He pointed
                            out that the U.S. remains Tunisia's major assistance donor with proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 loans and grants totaling
                            nearly $40 million, or about 11 percent of the total US economic
                            assistance to Africa. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> expressed hope that the
                            very substantial development assistance which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is providing under very tight budgetary
                            circumstances will help Tunisia meet its varied requirements and perhaps
                            free Tunisian foreign exchange for any purchases of internal security
                            equipment Tunisia might wish to make. He added, that should Tunisia wish
                            to consider buying internal security equipment, the US would be prepared
                            to offer TDY services, on a grant basis, of a public safety expert to
                            advise on purchases.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli expressed appreciation for the US decision to open
                            negotiations on adding wheat and oil to the current <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Agreement and for the offer to add $1
                            million to the AG Sector Loan. He said, however, that his government
                            will be disappointed that the US will not be able to assist in meeting
                            Tunisia's internal security needs. El Goulli asked whether the question
                            of internal security assistance might be reviewed in the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that this
                            should be considered the final decision on the Tunisian request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that the long
                            study which preceded our decision carefully assessed all of the problems
                            involved. He noted that there are never problems with the Congress
                            concerning the economic program in Tunisia. However, when one discusses
                            internal security assistance problems do arise. </p>
                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli asked whether the program loan might be used to
                            procure some of the non-military type items included in the internal
                            security request, for example, communications equipment. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Note</hi>: The Ambassador was probably referring to
                            electrical generators. There was no mention of communications equipment
                            in the request as delivered.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> said that <pb n="3" xml:id="d158-03"
                                facs="d158-03"/>public safety purchases under the program loan would
                            not be appropriate, noting that the expenditures to be made under that
                            loan were generally determined last year when it was prepared. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that it is now
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> policy to concentrate assistance
                            in specific economic sectors. For this reason, the usual program loan in
                            Tunisia is being replaced this year by an agricultural sector loan. In
                            offering to seek the addition of $1 million to that loan we are hopeful
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be able to free
                            foreign exchange for any internal security purchases that it might wish
                            to make. </p>
                        <p>Military Assistance. The Ambassador asked whether there was any word yet
                            about the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 military assistance
                            program for Tunisia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that legislation has not yet cleared Congress and until it does
                            we will not be in a position to discuss the Tunisian program. He
                            expressed regret that the complicated internal processes of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may seem sometimes to make life
                            difficult for our friends. </p>
                        <p>In concluding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            emphasized that the US response to Tunisia's request for help represents
                            a very considerable effort, under difficult circumstances, to assist a
                            friend. He noted, for example, that there are certain risks in seeking
                            to enlarge the AG sector loan, when the objective is to free Tunisian
                            foreign exchange for public safety purchases. Ambassador El Goulli
                            expressed his understanding of the problems posed by the Tunisian
                            request and said that he would seek to place the US response in proper
                            perspective for his government.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that he wished to
                            convey certain decisions that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            has reached concerning several recent requests by Tunisia for
                            assistance, particularly the request for internal security assistance.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> explained that only
                            after a very thorough and time-consuming examination of all the possible
                            alternatives involved, was it possible to arrive at these decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> frankly informed
                            Ambassador El Goulli that the means of the USG to provide assistance in
                            the internal security field have become very limited. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that in the months that
                            have passed since officers of our Embassy in Tunis met with Tunisian
                            officials to reduce the internal security request to its most essential
                            elements; an important element of Congress has been revealed that it is
                            against public safety assistance. He referred to the Senate's recent
                            amendment to the appropriation bill proposing that public safety
                            programs be limited to financing from security assistance funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that while every
                            effort was made to respond in a positive way to the Tunisian request,
                            given the mood of Congress, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has
                            concluded that it cannot provide assistance to Tunisia in the area of
                            internal security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            assured Ambassador El Goulli that the U.S. remains very interested in
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d159-02" facs="d159-02"/>Tunisia and will continue
                            to make a substantial effort to assist in Tunisia's development. In this
                            connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> informed
                            El Goulli that the US is prepared to demonstrate its special friendship
                            for Tunisia by considering the addition of $1 million to the
                            Agricultural Sector Loan now being developed in <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> referred to the recent
                            US decision to open negotiations in Tunis on the addition of 60,000 tons
                            of wheat and 10,000 tons of soybean oil to the <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1972 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I
                            Agreement. The value of these additions is about $4 million. He pointed
                            out that the U.S. remains Tunisia's major assistance donor with proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 loans and grants totaling
                            nearly $40 million, or about 11 percent of the total US economic
                            assistance to Africa. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> expressed hope that the
                            very substantial development assistance which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is providing under very tight budgetary
                            circumstances will help Tunisia meet its varied requirements and perhaps
                            free Tunisian foreign exchange for any purchases of internal security
                            equipment Tunisia might wish to make. He added, that should Tunisia wish
                            to consider buying internal security equipment, the US would be prepared
                            to offer TDY services, on a grant basis, of a public safety expert to
                            advise on purchases.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli expressed appreciation for the US decision to open
                            negotiations on adding wheat and oil to the current <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Agreement and for the offer to add $1
                            million to the AG Sector Loan. He said, however, that his government
                            will be disappointed that the US will not be able to assist in meeting
                            Tunisia's internal security needs. El Goulli asked whether the question
                            of internal security assistance might be reviewed in the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> replied that this
                            should be considered the final decision on the Tunisian request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that the long
                            study which preceded our decision carefully assessed all of the problems
                            involved. He noted that there are never problems with the Congress
                            concerning the economic program in Tunisia. However, when one discusses
                            internal security assistance problems do arise. </p>
                        <p>Ambassador El Goulli asked whether the program loan might be used to
                            procure some of the non-military type items included in the internal
                            security request, for example, communications equipment. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Note</hi>: The Ambassador was probably referring to
                            electrical generators. There was no mention of communications equipment
                            in the request as delivered.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName> said that <pb n="3" xml:id="d159-03"
                                facs="d159-03"/>public safety purchases under the program loan would
                            not be appropriate, noting that the expenditures to be made under that
                            loan were generally determined last year when it was prepared. </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName> said that it is now
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> policy to concentrate assistance
                            in specific economic sectors. For this reason, the usual program loan in
                            Tunisia is being replaced this year by an agricultural sector loan. In
                            offering to seek the addition of $1 million to that loan we are hopeful
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be able to free
                            foreign exchange for any internal security purchases that it might wish
                            to make. </p>
                        <p>Military Assistance. The Ambassador asked whether there was any word yet
                            about the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 military assistance
                            program for Tunisia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            replied that legislation has not yet cleared Congress and until it does
                            we will not be in a position to discuss the Tunisian program. He
                            expressed regret that the complicated internal processes of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may seem sometimes to make life
                            difficult for our friends. </p>
                        <p>In concluding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>
                            emphasized that the US response to Tunisia's request for help represents
                            a very considerable effort, under difficult circumstances, to assist a
                            friend. He noted, for example, that there are certain risks in seeking
                            to enlarge the AG sector loan, when the objective is to free Tunisian
                            foreign exchange for public safety purchases. Ambassador El Goulli
                            expressed his understanding of the problems posed by the Tunisian
                            request and said that he would seek to place the US response in proper
                            perspective for his government.</p>

                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE<lb/>WASHINGTON<lb/>March 14, 1972 </p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President: </p>
                        <p>With deepest appreciation, I wish to thank you for the warm sentiments
                            conveyed to me in your recent letter which was delivered personally by
                            Ambassador El Goulli. I think often of the close and friendly ties that
                            have long existed between our two nations and of the very special
                            affection which the United States and the American people have for you. </p>
                        <p>It was in the spirit of our rapport that I asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to share with you some of my
                            early thoughts concerning my visits to Peking and Moscow. I feel very
                            strongly that close consultations with our good friends, such as
                            Tunisia, are essential in pursuing our mutual objectives of world peace
                            and security. As a further step in these consultations, I have asked
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJA1">Calhoun</persName> to convey to
                            you some of my observations following my return from the People's
                            Republic of China. </p>
                        <p>It is always appropriate and useful that Tunisia and the United States
                            maintain close contact, not only because our nations share common
                            international goals, but because the United States remains deeply
                            interested in Tunisia, both in its security and in its development. </p>
                        <p>You may be assured, Mr. President, that with the resources that are
                            available, the United States will continue to do what it can to assist
                            in Tunisia's further development. </p>

                        <p>I also wish to express to you my personal admiration for the unflagging
                            efforts you have made to promote world peace and to further human
                            understanding. I look forward to close and continuing cooperation
                            between our two nations.</p>

                        <p>1. FOLLOWING IS MY OVERVIEW STATEMENT ON THE PADM AND PARA REVIEW FOR
                            TUNISIA 1972. SINCE THE EMBASSY DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT
                            FORMALLY BEFORE THE PARA REVIEW AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE PADM, I REQUEST
                            THAT THE ENCLOSED OVERVIEW STATEMENT AND THE COUNTRY TEAM EVALUATION BE
                            MADE AVAILABLE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE <gloss target="#t_IGAF1"
                                >IG/AF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. BEGIN TEXT. TUNISIA HAS SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE IN 1956 PLAYED A ROLE
                            IN REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE AND
                            POPULATION, ITS WEALTH AND POWER. THIS ROLE—AND THE INFLUENCE TUNISIA
                            HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXERT—WHILE THEY SHOULD NOT BE EXAGGERATED, HAVE SERVED
                            US INTERESTS WELL. TUNISIAN POLICY HAS OFTEN BEEN ALIGNED WITH US
                            POLICY. TUNISIA'S CONSTANT FRIENDSHIP FOR THE US, SURVIVING UPS AND
                            DOWNS IN US RELATIONS WITH ITS WEALTHIER AND MORE POWERFUL NEIGHBORS,
                            HAS GIVEN US A RELATIVELY SECURE FOOTHOLD ON A KEY POINT OF THE
                            SOUTHERNMEDITERRANEAN COAST AND HAS HELPED TO PREVENT THIS AREA FROM
                            FALLING UNDER UNFRIENDLY DOMINATION. WE HAVE ALSO BENEFITTED FROM A
                            FRIENDLY, RESPECTED AND REALISTIC VOICE IN ARAB, MEDITERRANEAN AND THIRD
                            WORLD COUNCILS. SUCH ASSETS ARE PERHAPS EASY TO TAKE FOR GRANTED OR TO
                            UNDERRATE, BUT THEY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LOOM MORE IMPORTANT IF WE LOST
                            THEM OR HAD TO ACQUIRE THEM NOW: THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AS WE BECOME
                            MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MORE LOCKED INTO <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d161-02" facs="d161-02"/>ISRAELI POLICY AND INTO THE SUPPORT
                            OF THE INCREASINGLY ISOLATED JORDANIAN REGIME. </p>
                        <p>3. THESE ASSETS DERIVE PARTLY, TO BE SURE, FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF
                            PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2">BOURGUIBA</persName>, WHO SEES THE
                            WORLD WITH AN OPTIC SIMILAR TO OUR OWN. THEY ALSO REPRESENT THE FRUITS
                            OF A CONSTANT US POLICY TOWARD TUNISIA AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO
                            DISSIPATE UNNECESSARILY. WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN TUNISIA, AND THE
                            RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES SEEM DISAPPOINTING, BUT DESPITE ITS LACK OF
                            NATURAL RESOURCES, SOME ILL-ADVISED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES (NOW
                            REVERSED) AND A MAJOR NATURAL DISASTER, THE TUNISIAN ECONOMY IS NOW
                            GROWING AND SHOWS GREATER PROMISE. ITS HUMAN RESOURCES REMAIN ITS CHIEF
                            ASSET AND SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED AS AN IMPORTANT DYNAMIC IN THE
                            LONGER RUN. FROM THE POLITICAL STANDPOINT TUNISIA IS RELATIVELY STABLE,
                            AND ALTHOUGH A DIFFICULT AND CRUCIAL TRANSITIONAL PERIOD LIES AHEAD I
                            BELIEVE IT WILL SURVIVE AS A STABLE AREA. THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT
                            AFTER <persName>BOURGUIBA</persName> TUNISIA WILL RETAIN A REALISTIC AND
                            MODERATE ORIENTATION IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AND THAT US-TUNISIAN
                            FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WILL SURVIVE TUNISIA'S POLITICAL TRANSITION
                            AND ITS ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON THE US, AND WILL HAVE CONTINUING VALUE
                            FOR US. THESE INTANGIBLES, THOUGH HARDER TO MEASURE THAN ECONOMIC
                            ASSISTANCE OR GROWTH, SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION THAT US INTERESTS HAVE
                            BEEN WELL SUPPORTED BY US POLICIES. </p>
                        <p>4. US POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN TUNISIA ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT
                            DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE. CONFRONTED WITH CHANGING POWER ALIGNMENTS,
                            GREATER PRIORITIES IN OTHER AREAS, AND WITH LIMITATIONS ON OUR OWN
                            RESOURCES, IT IS NATURAL THAT WE SEEK POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IN LINE WITH
                            OUR CAPABILITIES. NEVERTHELESS, WE SHOULD PRESERVE THE ESSENTIALS OF A
                            RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS LONG SERVED BOTH U.S. AND TUNISIAN INTERESTS AND
                            IS THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INVESTMENT. THE
                            RELATIVE PREDOMINANCE OF THE UNITED STATES IN TUNISIAN DEVELOPMENT AND
                            SECURITY ASSISTANCE HAS DECLINED, AND OTHER DONORS IN EUROPE AND THE
                            WORLD BANK HAVE RISEN IN IMPORTANCE, WHICH IS AS IT SHOULD BE. U.S.
                            POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN TUNISIA IS ALREADY UNDERGOING A SUBTLE DECLINE,
                            PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE U.S. IS INCREASINGLY SEEN AS THE ONLY REAL <pb

                            MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT, AN ISSUE WHICH SHARPLY AFFECTS TUNISIAN OPINION
                            AND INCREASINGLY INFLUENCES TUNISIAN POLICY. </p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d161-04" facs="d161-04"/>
                        <p>5. ALTHOUGH TUNISIAN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING, CERTAIN
                            EXTENUATING OR EXPLANATORY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN NOTED AND THE
                            ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM-TERM SEEMS MORE PROMISING THAN
                            SUGGESTED IN THE PADM. THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS BROKEN WITH THE ERRORS
                            OF THE PAST, AND ITS SUCCESSORS WILL PROBABLY CARRY ON. IN THIS EVOLVING
                            SITUATION THE GOT'S COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SHOULD
                            NOT BE PREMATURELY UNDERMINED BY AN ABRUPT REDUCTION IN AID OR
                            UNREALISTIC STANDARDS FOR TYING AID TO SPECIFICS OF TUNISIAN
                            PERFORMANCE. OTHER DONORS, INCLUDING THE WORLD BANK, ARE NOT LIKELY TO
                            PRESS THE TUNISIANS ON MAJOR ECONOMIC POLICY ISSUES OR EVEN AGREE ON THE
                            REFORMS REQUIRED. I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD SEEK TO REDUCE OUR DEVELOPMENT
                            ASSISTANCE ROLE GRADUALLY RELATIVE TO THOSE OF OTHER DONORS, BUT IN
                            DOING SO WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT OUR LEVERAGE WILL BE LESS. DESPITE OUR
                            BEST EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE OTHER DONORS TO INCREASE THEIR AID AND TO
                            BETTER COORDINATE AID, OUR EXPECTATIONS ON THESE SCORES SHOULD BE MODEST
                            AND SHOULD SHAPE OUR ASSISTANCE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. NO OTHER LIKELY
                            SOURCES WILL PROVIDE THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF ASSISTANCE NOW PROVIDED BY
                            THE U.S. DECISIONS ON OUR ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SHOULD REFLECT THESE
                            REALITIES AND THE BROADER POLICY ELEMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE AND SHOULD ALSO
                            RECOGNIZE THE U.S. DOMESTIC INTERESTS SERVED BY OUR <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 AND PROGRAM OR SECTOR LOANS. </p>
                        <p>6. A REVIEW OF OUR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PLAN FOR TUNISIA IS ALREADY
                            UNDERWAY AT USAID AIMING AT A GRADUAL PHASING-DOWN OF AID LEVELS. BUT IT
                            IS PREMATURE NOW TO DEFINE THE <pb n="5" xml:id="d161-05" facs="d161-05"
                            />BASIS AND PROSPECTS FOR EVENTUAL PHASING-OUT OF AID AND TO EXPECT THE
                            1972 CONSULTATIVE GROUP MEETING TO BRING FORTH EITHER A FULLY
                            SATISFACTORY TUNISIAN DEVELOPMENT PLAN OR A COORDINATED DONOR VIEW ON
                            THE LONGER FUTURE. THESE COMMENTS DO NOT RUN COUNTER TO THE BROAD INTENT
                            OF THE PADM BUT POINT UP PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING TIMING AND
                            IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR POLICY. WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS THE WORLD BANK
                            TO LEAD, AND INTENSIFY OUR BILATERAL EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GREATER
                            ASSISTANCE FROM OHER DONORS, BUT NOT EXPECT THE DEGREE OF PROGRESS
                            SUGGESTED IN THE PADM AND PARA PEVIEW. WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO KEEP U.S.
                            DEVELOPMENT AID POLICY, INCLUDING THE IMPORTANT PEACE CORPS PROGRAM
                            HERE, FOCUSED ON THE KEY AREAS OF AGRICULTURE (WHICH SERVES BOTH
                            TUNISIAN AND U.S. INTERESTS CONCRETELY), FAMILY PLANNING, NUTRITION, AND
                            EDUCATION.</p>
                        <p>7. RECOGNIZING THAT TUNISIA HAS DEPENDED PRIMARILY ON U.S. SECURITY
                            ASSISTANCE, WE SHOULD KEEP OUR MTLITARY ASSISTANCE AT A REASONABLE LEVEL
                            IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR DOMESTIC PROBLEMS IN
                            THIS AREA. WITH OUR RECENT TURN-DOWN OF TUNISIA'S SPECIAL REQUEST FOR
                            INTERNAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND OUR REJECTION OF THEIR REQUEST FOR A
                            SMALL CONTINUING PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM, WE SHOULD AVOID ABRUPT
                            REDUCTIONS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE. IN WORKING TOWARD ELIMINATION OF
                            MATERIAL GRANT AID AFTER <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75, WE SHOULD
                            ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE TUNISIA TO CONSIDER FMS CREDIT PURCHASES BUT AIM AT
                            AN ANNUAL MAP OF $3 MILLTON IN THE MEANTIME. </p>
                        <p>8. AS WE GRADUALLY REDUCE ASSISTANCE, WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE GREATER
                            IMPORTANCE OF OUR EFFECTIVE CULTURAL AND INFORMATION PROGRAMS IN TUNISIA
                            IN ORDER TO BUILD ON WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SINCE TUNISIAN INDEPENDENCE,
                            INCLUDING CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR AN EFFECTIVE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TEACHING
                            PROGRAM THROUGH PEACE CORPS OR OTHER MEANS. </p>
                        <p>9. IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_BH2"
                                >BOURGUIBA</persName>'S SUGGESTION IN A FEBRUARY 1972 LETTER TO

                            YEARS FOR A VARIETY OF UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS. I RECOMMEND HIGH-LEVEL

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName>'s request when Ambassador

                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Newsom</persName>'s

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> said he would be leaving
                            for Tunis at 10:00 p.m. and was very sorry to have missed having a
                            further opportunity to meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD1"
                                >Newsom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Speaking personally and emotionally - and at length - the <gloss
                                target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> said he did not understand American
                            policy. It almost looked as if the US and the Soviets had agreed on a
                            division of spheres of influence that would turn over the entire Arab
                            east to the Russians and bring the latter to Tunisia's border. Why had
                            the US completely written off the Palestinians and become totally wedded
                            to the Israelis? This made it very difficult for America's friends like
                            Tunisia. Sadat had thrown the Russians out but in the absence of any
                            support from the US, he would have no choice but to enter into a new
                            relationship with them. The Libyans were, like himself, very devout
                            (tres croyants) but they too would he driven by despair to deal with the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> protested, as
                            possible, that there clearly was no agreement with the Soviets on
                            spheres of influence, in the Mediterranean or elsewhere in the ME.
                            Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had made a
                            special point of emphasizing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of
                            the Palestinian people and had, as the <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            well knew, made great efforts to find a peaceful settlement in the
                            ME.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> stated that he disagreed
                            profoundly with the US position on terrorism. How was it possible for an
                            Arab not to feel deeply about the fate of the Palestinians? Why did the
                            US react so strongly to acts of despair by the Palestinians while
                            passing over in silence the daily terrorism of the Israelis, who had
                            founded their state with its use? </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> tried unsuccessfully
                            to persuade <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Masmoudi</persName> to draw a distinction
                            between acts of war and indiscriminate threats to innocent
                            non-combatants, or to reassure him that our proposed Convention clearly
                            excluded political movements. </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FM1">FM</gloss> nevertheless was obviously very
                            pained at this seemingly insuperable difference that had arisen in the
                            hitherto extremely close US/Tunisian relationship. He said that Tunisia
                            was obliged for the sake of credibility to make approaches to Hanoi, but
                            that should not interfere with the US connection. (He said nothing about
                            going to Saigon.) </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWII1">Witman</persName> in closing urged that
                            the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> continue the dialogue with
                            Ambassador Seelye, who would shortly be arriving in Tunis.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>When our new ambassador to Tunisia presented his credentials to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH2">Bourguiba</persName> he also transmitted
                            an oral message of greetings from you and a warmly inscribed photograph.
                            He reported that <persName>Bourguiba</persName> was deeply touched by
                            your personal gestures and expressed warmest thanks.
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has now sent you a photograph of
                            himself and a long and thoughtful letter of thanks (Tab B). </p>
                        <p>While this is ostensibly a thank-you letter,
                                <persName>Bourguiba</persName> injects a substantive point which
                            would appear to require your reply. He expresses hope that “you might
                            find the occasion for a consultation at as high a level as possible in
                            order to re-examine together our bilateral relations…and analyze
                            together in order to jointly undertake the actions necessary for the
                            consolidation of peace and security in this world.” </p>
                        <p>We do not know precisely what <persName>Bourguiba</persName> has in mind.
                            The consensus is that he may simply be seeking general reassurance that
                            the US remains interested in Tunisia. Should it be more than that,
                            someone can always be sent to talk with him. Also, both you and the Vice
                            President have standing invitations to visit Tunisia, and our Assistant
                            Secretary for African Affairs is often in the area. This last could meet
                            the need for the time being. </p>
                        <p>For the moment, all that seems required is to reply to
