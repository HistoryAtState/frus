                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991,
                    established a new statutory charter for the preparation of the series. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.). </p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series
                    present a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign
                    policy decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes
                    of the series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States
                    Government. The statute also confirms the editing principles established by
                    Secretary Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided
                    by the principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be
                    altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a
                    deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purpose of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the</hi> Foreign Relations <hi

                </p>
                <p>This electronic-only volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions
                    and actions of the foreign policy of the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and
                    Gerald R. Ford. This volume is published in a new electronic-only format.
                    Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the
                    1969–1976 subseries, covering the Nixon and Nixon-Ford administrations, will be
                    in this format. The decision to institute this change was taken in full
                    consultation with the Department’s Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation, which was established under the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> statute. The advantages of this new method of presenting
                    documentation are evident in this volume: the format enables convenient access
                    to more key documentation on a broader range of issues, all or any portion of
                    which can be easily downloaded. Annotation—the value added element of
                    documentary editing—is still present in limited form, but not to the scale of a
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> printed volume. This
                    electronic-only publication results in substantial savings in cost and time of
                    production, thus allowing the series to present a fuller range of documentation,
                    on a wider range of topics, sooner than would have been possible under a
                    print-only format. These advantages compensate for the fact that this <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an actual book bound in
                    traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General
                    Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing
                    the great majority of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also posted in electronic
                    format on the Department of State’s website. While the future of research in
                    documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease of use and
                    availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue to use both
                    print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In that
                    sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series
                    begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued by
                    subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for more than 140 years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the Nixon and Ford administrations
                    concerning issues that were primarily negotiated in United Nations bodies, other
                    international governmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations.
                    The topics covered in this volume are related to the chapters in <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969-1976, Volume E–2, Documents on
                    Global Issues 1973-1976. In both volumes, the issues addressed crossed
                    “traditional” bilateral and regional boundaries, often dealt with topics not
                    previously given to sustained, high-level negotiations, and frequently required
                    novel approaches, integrated thinking, and revision of bureaucratic
                    organizations. The table of contents provides the best idea of the kinds of
                    issues documented by this volume: population policy, food policy, women’s
                    issues, general United Nation affairs, and controversies surrounding United
                    Nations membership. This is by no means a complete list of the global issues and
                    United Nations topics that the Nixon and Ford administrations confronted.
                    Others, such as energy, disarmament, transnational economic issues, and refugee
                    policy, are covered in separate volumes in the 1969–1976 subseries. It is the
                    opinion of the editor that this volume covers the era most faithfully by
                    focusing on those topics that the Nixon and Ford administrations recognized as
                    distinctly global issues dealt with on a transnational basis, primarily through
                    the United Nations. Topics treated primarily on a bilateral or regional basis
                    can be found in other volumes in this subseries.</p>
                <p>The second Nixon administration and the Ford administration grappled with a
                    variety of transnational issues in the context of a growing appreciation for the
                    concept of “interdependency.” Concerns about overpopulation among policymakers,
                    experts, and the general public rose to prominence at the same time that
                    worldwide food shortages raised the specter of famine and instability. Many
                    concluded that addressing the status and rights of women would provide an
                    important key to reducing population, therefore relieving pressure on food
                    stocks. The United Nations sponsored major international conferences on the food
                    and population questions in 1974, and on women’s issues in 1975. The three
                    chapters covering these issues trace U.S. preparations and negotiations leading
                    up to the conferences, as well as the resultant policy, programmatic, and
                    bureaucratic responses. The U.N. general chapter outlines U.S. policymakers’
                    approach to the many issues of broad interest that typically arose during the
                    General Assembly’s annual and special sessions, as well as information about the
                    role played by the United States Representative to the United Nations. This
                    chapter indicates U.S. policymakers found the United Nations both a frustrating
                    and a promising venue to pursue U.S. interests. The U.N. representation chapter
                    focuses on which governments might attain or be denied representation in the
                    General Assembly. U.S. policymakers opposed recognition of communist regimes
                    claiming to represent Vietnam and Cambodia, attempted to defeat efforts to expel
                    South Africa, Portugal, and Israel, and advocated admission of the Republic of
                    Korea. One of the most contentious issues of the 1973–1976 period, this chapter
                    chronicles U.S. policymakers’ attempts to reverse a growing sense of isolation
                    and marginalization in the conduct of the General Assembly’s business.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted. </p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> electronic-only volumes follows Office style guidelines,
                    supplemented by guidance from the General Editor. The original text is
                    reproduced exactly, including marginalia or other notations, which are both
                    visible on the facsimile copy of the document and described in the source note.
                    There is also a text version of the document. The editor has supplied a heading,
                    a summary, and a source note with additional relevant information, as required,
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected in the text file. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the text, and a list of abbreviations,
                    persons, and sources accompanies the volume. </p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions in roman type are used on the facsimile copy and in the text
                    file to indicate text omitted by the editors because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject. Text that remains classified after declassification review is
                    blacked-out on the facsimile copy and a bracketed insertion (in italic type)
                    appears in the text file. Entire documents selected for publication but withheld
                    because they must remain classified are accounted for by a heading, a source
                    note, and a bracketed note indicating the number of pages not declassified.
                    These denied documents are listed in their chronological place in the
                    volume.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation reviews records,
                    advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign

                    overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all
                    aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Historical
                    Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual
                    volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its
                    attention and reviews volumes, as it deems necessary, to fulfill its advisory
                    and statutory obligations. </p>

                </p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the Nixon Presidential historical
                    materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern
                    access to the Nixon Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for additional
                    restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights of former
                    Nixon White House officials, since these officials were not given the
                    opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the
                    PRMPA and related implementing public access regulations require NARA to notify
                    formally the Nixon estate and former Nixon White House staff members that the
                    agency is scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical materials.
                    The Nixon estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to contest
                    the release of Nixon historical materials in which they were a participant or
                    are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to
                    segregate and return private and personal materials to the creator of the files.
                    All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that include materials from
                    NARA's Nixon Presidential Materials Staff are processed and released in
                    accordance with the PRMPA.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws. </p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The declassification review of
                    this volume, which began and was completed in 2008, resulted in the decision to
                    withhold one document in full and to make a minor excision in one document. The
                    editor is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this
                    volume and as a result of the declassification review process described above,
                    that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the second Nixon
                    administration and the Ford administration towards global issues topics
                    addressed primarily in United Nations and other international bodies.</p>

                            SUBJECT: Assessment of the 27th <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            General Assembly</p>
                        <p>1. OVERALL ASSESSMENT</p>
                        <p>With virtually every important world issue debated at the General
                            Assembly, it is a telling commentary on the state of that body that most
                            of our effort had to be expended on preventing bad situations from
                            getting worse--i.e., on damage-limiting. A large number of rhetorical or
                            redundant resolutions were passed, but sound decisions did carry forward
                            useful work on a number of important issues. On the whole, we can be
                            pleased with the outcome, and we are grateful for the support of our
                            diplomatic missions in some critical situations.</p>
                        <p>For us, the endorsement by more than two-thirds for reduction of our
                            assessment to 25 percent (from the present 31.52 percent) was especially
                            gratifying; but this was correctly perceived by the majority as the
                            necessary choice of a lesser evil. Many developing nations, in
                            particular, realistically went along to avoid possible adverse
                            repercussions on the level of our voluntary contributions.</p>
                        <p>The greatest successes of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> were on
                            the economic and normative side, where we pushed through the Stockholm
                            Conference package on the environment, placed the population program on
                            a sounder basis, and got the law of the sea conference on the rails. We
                            were, however, steamrollered on a number of issues that saw the
                            have-nots pitted against the haves.</p>
                        <p>Overall, we see the following trends:</p>
                        <p>-- A greater cohesion among the so-called non-aligned countries, notably
                            on issues involving the national liberation movements in Africa and
                            other questions of particular interest the LDCs. The most important
                            manifestation of this phenomenon was the stonewall front which turned
                            aside all efforts to get substantive action on terrorism and the
                            protection of diplomats. Other instances were the stronger anti-Israel
                            resolution on the Middle East, the less satisfactory vote (for us) on
                            the Indian Ocean Peace Zone, the overwhelming votes in favor of a World
                            Disarmament Conference (<gloss target="#t_WDC1">WDC</gloss>) and on the
                            need for rules governing Direct Broadcast Satellites, and of course the
                            vigor behind resolutions on "colonialism and racism" in Southern
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>-- As a closely related phenomenon, increasing <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss> cohesion and militance on the issue of the control of
                            natural resources. While the difference from previous GA's was one of
                            degree, we saw significance in the thunderous applause greeting the
                            speeches of <persName corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> (Algeria),
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGS1">Salvador Allende</persName> and other
                            spokesmen for more extreme positions; in the resonance for charges
                            against "multinational corporations" and the unanimous LDC vote on
                            permanent sovereignty over natural resources." The developing nations
                            also tried hard to make the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> more
                            responsive to their interests but with little support from the developed
                            countries. Location of the environment secretariat in Nairobi was
                            perceived (and articulated) as a case of the LDCs showing their
                            "political will."</p>
                        <p>-- The beginnings of group and concerted among the nine members of the
                            European Economic Community, detracting a bit from the closeness of our
                            own consultations with them in the <gloss target="#t_WEO1">WEO</gloss>
                            (Western European and Others) caucus. Perhaps the most notable
                            manifestation of this developing solidarity was the role of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> Nine in shaping and giving stature to a
                            Middle East resolution which was clearly designed to generate diplomatic
                            pressure on Israel and even on our assistance to Israel in spite of our
                            clear distaste for that exercise. On one occasion, one of the EC Nine
                            spoke formally on behalf of their group--a probable portent for the
                            future. </p>
                        <p>-- A greater frequency of complete U.S. isolation in voting especially on
                            political issues. We were less inclined this year to make tactical
                            compromises to improve our short-term parliamentary position, often
                            using our vote to maintain our credibility on the substance of issues
                            rather than to affect the voting outcome. As a result, for reasons
                            explained elsewhere in this Airgram, we stood alone in abstaining on the
                            resolution to establish a study committee on holding a WDC, and we cast
                            lone negative votes on Kenya's bid for the environment secretariat, and
                            on a request to the Outer Space Committee to elaborate principles on
                            satellite television broadcasting. Our company also dwindled in voting
                            against or abstaining on Middle East resolutions and on a number of
                            African resolutions (some edging closer to recognition of liberation
                            groups).</p>
                        <p>-- A decrease in the momentum of Soviet initiatives (although the
                            U.S.S.R. more frequently than we was in the mainstream of the Assembly
                            on political issues). With the groundwork laid for admittance of the two
                            Germanies next Year, the Korea question postponed, avoidance of a
                            general debate on Bangladesh membership and minimal substantive
                            discussion of Puerto Rico, East-West differences were less prominent
                            that North-South differences. The major Soviet initiative on non-use of
                            force, which would in effect permit Soviet use of nuclear weapons to
                            meet a Chinese conventional attack, met with a massive expression of
                            ennui. On WDC, in the face of demurrers by the U.S. the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and others, the Soviets had to settle
                            for a watered-down resolution setting up a study committee. Even on
                            their perennial "Strengthening International Security" (<gloss
                                target="#t_SIS1">SIS</gloss>) item, the play was again taken away
                            from them by the non-aligned. On the other hand, we found common ground
                            with the U.S.S.R. on a number of disarmament questions, as well as on
                            law of the seas and certain budgetary questions, and were able to avoid
                            serious conflict in the environment question over German
                            representation.</p>
                        <p>-- Greater activity and a more sharply defined profile of the People's
                            Republic of China. The PRC delegation broadened its activities to
                            virtually all aspects of GA work and showed ease and skill in dealing
                            with other delegations. The Chinese were also active socially, accepting
                            and extending invitations even to those with whom they have no
                            diplomatic relations. They maintained a sound working relationship with
                            our Mission. Illustrative of PRC tactical skill was their vote with the
                            majority on the WDC issue, even while they let it be known that they
                            would have nothing to do with a WDC or serve on the study committee.
                            Major PRC themes were still opposition to "super-power hegemony,"
                            support for "anti-imperialist" revolutionary movements, and solidarity
                            with the third world. While opposing us on many issues (Middle East,
                            terrorism, colonialism, law of the sea), their sharpest attacks were
                            directed at the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>The session underscored again that at this stage in history the world
                            organization is most effective in serving as a vehicle for the delivery
                            of technical assistance, drafting international law and setting
                            standards far international behavior in specific fields. It is not yet
                            the solvent for large political and security issues--although we must
                            continue to try constructively to move it in that direction.</p>
                        <p>2. POLITICAL ISSUES</p>
                        <p>Terrorism and Hijacking. The effort by the U.S. and like-minded nations
                            to get the UN to take strong and speedy international legal action to
                            combat international terrorism and enforce air security suffered a major
                            rebuff when the Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a nonaligned resolution
                            (supported by the Soviets and East Europeans) that merely set up a
                            Committee to study the comments of governments on the problem and submit
                            a report to the next session.</p>
                        <p>We had hoped to maintain the momentum of the Secretary General's
                            initiative requesting the GA to consider measures to prevent
                            international terrorism and of the Secretary's proposals for urgent
                            action, notably the convening early in 1973 of a diplomatic conference
                            to draw up a convention directed against the export of international
                            terrorism. Western efforts to set up a specific timetable for drafting
                            and approving such a convention were countered by Arab and African
                            delegations, causing the Soviets, who had initially been cooperative, to
                            back as away from us. The Arabs saw the UN exercise as inspired by the
                            west and directed against the fedayeen. Despite our assurances, African
                            delegations also were concerned that anti-terrorist measures would
                            somehow circumscribe African liberation movements.</p>
                        <p>The Arab led Afro-Asian coalition spurned a compromise resolution
                            sponsored inter alia by Italy, Austria, Canada, and the U.K. (which
                            would have condemned acts of terrorism, requested the International Law
                            Commission to draft a convention to be considered at an early conference
                            and set up a working group to study causes), opting instead for a delay
                            of indefinite duration in coming to grips with the problem. BY a vote of
                            76-34 (U.S.), with 16 abstentions, the Assembly established a study
                            committee limited to recommending "possible cooperation" for elimination
                            of terrorism and exploring causes. Moreover, the thrust of the
                            resolution was changed for us by its emphasis on reaffirming "the
                            inalienable right to self-determination and independence of all peoples
                            under colonial and racist regimes" and condemning "the continuation of
                            repressive and terrorist acts by colonial, racist, and alien
                            regimes."</p>
                        <p>Although the United States and a number of other delegations pressed for
                            quicker action, the General Assembly also voted to postpone final
                            consideration of the draft articles on the protection of diplomatic
                            agents and other officials until the 1973 General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Soviet "Initiatives." With the PRC their key target, major Soviet were
                            mainly propaganda-oriented: A proposal that the Assembly endorse
                            "non-use of force" in international relations and permanent prohibition
                            of use of nuclear weapons; a highly-restrictive draft convention on
                            international direct television broadcasting via satellites; and renewed
                            efforts to get the Assembly to schedule a World Disarmament
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Though characterized as "fraudulent" by the PRC, and widely viewed as a
                            meaningless repetition of principles in the UN Charter and numerous
                            declarations, the proposal for non-use of force was adopted, but with
                            substantial abstentions (73-4-46). Asians and Africans supported it
                            partly as log-rolling and partly because they did not wish to spurn the
                            Soviets on a "peace" initiative. We abstained because we were skeptical
                            about the utility of restating principles of the Charter through GA
                            resolutions which detract from and indeed distort the provisions of the
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>On direct satellite television broadcasting to home receivers in other
                            countries, the Assembly refused to accept as a primary basis for action
                            the Soviet draft convention (which would have required prior consent to
                            such broadcasts by the receiving state); instead it requested the Outer
                            Space Committee to "elaborate principles." Although this was an
                            improvement, we opposed the commitment to establish "principles" at this
                            early stage of development of the technology and because of our concern
                            for the free flow of information. We recognize that the vote, in which
                            we were in the minority of one, showed that many countries are genuinely
                            concerned over what they see as a need to protect their populations
                            against foreign influences.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets failed to move the Assembly forward on actually convening or
                            establishing preparatory machinery for a WDC. We have opposed such a
                            conference, which offers little promise of constructive accomplishment,
                            and continue to believe that progress in this highly complex field can
                            best be achieved in expert forums of manageable size such as the
                            Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (<gloss target="#t_CCD1"
                                >CCD</gloss>). We abstained on the final resolution sponsored by the
                            non-aligned and declined to serve on the study committee which it called
                            for, among other reasons because the indicated lack of participation by
                            all nuclear powers would preclude any chance of the committee producing
                            useful results.</p>
                        <p>Concrete Disarmament Questions. We supported a resolution stressing the
                            urgency of ending nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, but
                            abstained on two other test ban resolutions which we considered
                            unsatisfactory. One condemned and set an arbitrary deadline for a halt
                            to all nuclear weapons testing and the other called on the U.S. and
                            U.S.S.R. to stop underground testing. We reaffirmed U.S. support for an
                            adequately verified test ban. The U.S. supported the Assembly's
                            resolution requesting the CCD to continue giving high priority to
                            negotiations toward early agreement on effective measures to prohibit
                            the development, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.</p>
                        <p>Along with most maritime powers, we abstained on the Sri Lanka resolution
                            calling for support of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a "Peace zone"
                            and setting up an ad hoc committee to study "practical measures" to
                            further the concept. We viewed such a study as particularly
                            inappropriate since it implicitly looked toward a regional attempt to
                            set up a special regime over navigation on part of the high seas in
                            advance of the 1973-1974 worldwide conference on the law of the sea.</p>
                        <p>We also abstained on a resolution commending the report of "expert"
                            consultants to the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> on napalm and
                            other incendiary weapons. We took the public position that we had
                            avoided association with the report from its inception but considered
                            that the report and the resolution contained political conclusions we
                            could not accept.</p>
                        <p>Middle East. While no debate would have been preferable, the outcome did
                            not unduly affect the prospects for further diplomatic efforts toward a
                            Middle East agreement. As before, the debate and the resolution were
                            inspired by Egypt, whose apparent aim was to maximize the impression
                            that the UN and "world public opinion" backed Egyptian policies against
                            those of Israel. As in previous years, the resolution drew selectively
                            on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution 242, castigated Israel
                            for alleged failure to cooperate with UN peace efforts, and criticized
                            the Israeli attitude towards occupied Arab territories. A new feature of
                            the early drafts circulated at Egypt's behest was to call upon states to
                            give no economic aid to Israel which would enable it to continue
                            occupation of Arab territories. This passage in turn provoked a new
                            element in Israeli opposition to GA debates oh the Middle East: its
                            threat to dissociate Israel from SC <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss>
                            242 as a basis for a peace settlement.</p>
                        <p>Consultations between Egypt and members of the EC Nine led to some
                            changes in the draft re-solution which partly redressed the political
                            "balance" of the resolution and removed the implicit threat of
                            "sanctions" against Israel. The Arabs can take satisfaction from the
                            increasing support they achieved for a slightly tougher resolution
                            (86-7-31 this year, 79-7-37 in 1971, and 57-16-39 in 1970). While the
                            Israelis finally dropped their threat on 242, the impact of the GA
                            resolution on them was clearly not a positive one.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bush explained that the U.S. would have voted against the
                            paragraph dealing with "aid" to Israel (had a separate vote been agreed
                            by the Assembly) but the U.S. abstained on the resolution as a whole.
                            Many Arab delegations seemed satisfied with this stand and the Israeli
                            Delegation expressed understanding of our position and appreciation for
                            the forthright statements during the debate.</p>
                        <p>African Issues. This GA was noteworthy in launching a determined
                            campaign, to obtain legitimacy national liberation movements as
                            "authentic representatives" of African peoples. In particular, efforts
                            were stepped up to secure status in UN bodies for liberation movements
                            in Portuguese Territories. Over our opposition these groups were invited
                            to sit as observers at Committee Four sessions; the Africans desisted in
                            an attempt to have Amilcar Cabral, head of <gloss target="#t_PAIGC1"
                                >PAIGC</gloss>, invited to address the GA only after Cabral withdrew
                            when he realized the invitation would not gain a consensus. An
                            increasing number of resolutions demanded direct UN aid to these
                            movements outside and "in liberated areas." In voting against these
                            resolutions we were in a small minority sometimes including only the
                            U.K., Portugal and South Africa.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to the constructive action by the SC on November 22 which
                            called on Portugal to negotiate with "the parties concerned" toward
                            reaching "a solution of the armed confrontation that exists" in the
                            Portuguese Territories, the GA acted unhelpfully in adopting by 96-6-8 a
                            blatantly partisan resolution which, while also favoring negotiations,
                            stipulated that the national liberation movements were the "authentic
                            representatives of the true aspirations" of the peoples concerned.
                            Similarly on Rhodesia the U.S. found itself in a small minority in
                            opposing what we considered extreme and impractical assertions of the GA
                            authority. We were particularly disturbed over a resolution containing
                            specific condemnation of the U.S. for importation of chrome and other
                            metals in accord with the Byrd Amendment. Last year's resolutions had
                            asked us not to take this step, while the SC resolutions avoided direct
                            condemnation of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>SIS and <gloss target="#t_SOR1">SOR</gloss>. Although originally a Soviet
                            propaganda vehicle, the SIS (Strengthening International Security)
                            resolution in 1972 reflected primarily non-aligned concerns,
                            particularly on the sovereign right freely to dispose of natural
                            resources. Because of the item's glittering generalities the U.S., Japan
                            and other West Europeans adopted a posture of massive indifference, and
                            the resolution was adopted 94-2 (South Africa, Portugal) to 12
                            (U.S.).</p>
                        <p>At the request of Romania, the GA discussed an item entitled
                            "Strengthening of the role of the UN with regard to the maintenance and
                            consolidation of national peace and security, the development of
                            cooperation among all nations and the promotion of the rules of
                            international law in relations between states" (SOR). The Romanians
                            proved to be highly cooperative in accepting western comments, and
                            without formal vote the GA adopted a declaratory resolution on the
                            usefulness of strengthening the UN, inter alia, for "safeguarding the
                            right of all peoples to decide their own fate without any outside
                            interference." The Soviets appeared uneasy over this Romanian initiative
                            and did not fail to notice the greater attention and support received by
                            SOR (with its implied criticism of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine) than SIS.</p>
                        <p>Seabeds and Oceans. We were pleased that the Assembly decided unanimously
                            on an "accelerated" work program of preparations leading to a two-week
                            organizational session of the Third UN Law of the Sea (<gloss
                                target="#t_LOS1">LOS</gloss>) Conference at New York in November,
                            ,1973 and an eight-week substantive session at Santiago, Chile in April
                            and May 1974. The Conference, with the approval of the General Assembly,
                            may provide for additional time if it is needed. The 28th General
                            Assembly will review the progress of the preparatory work, which will
                            include 13 weeks of meetings in 1973, and will make any further
                            necessary decisions, including issuing invitation for the Conference.
                            Conclusion of a comprehensive LOS treaty will require teaching agreement
                            on a number of major issues, including the nature of the international
                            regime to be established for the deep seabeds, the breadth of the
                            territorial sea, free transit through international straits, fisheries,
                            marine pollution and scientific research.</p>
                        <p>There was little substantive discussion on LOS at this session of the
                            Assembly. However, a significant split developed among the LDC's when,
                            over the staunch opposition of Latin American and other coastal states
                            which espouse broad national jurisdiction, the Assembly adopted a
                            resolution sponsored by a group of landlocked and shelf-locked states,
                            requesting the Secretary-General to prepare a study comparing the
                            economic significance for the international community of various
                            proposed seaward limits of national jurisdiction. We voted for that
                            resolution, and also for one sponsored by Peru, requesting the
                            Secretary-General to prepare a related study comparing the economic
                            significance for costal states of such proposed limits of national
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Human Rights. As in past years the principal focus was on racial
                            questions, leaving little time for equally important issues. The
                            Assembly decided to launch in 1973 a Decade for Struggle Against Racism
                            and Racial Discrimination. Overcoming Soviet and Arab objections, the
                            Assembly also decided that at its next session it would give priority to
                            elaboration of a declaration on elimination of all forms of religious
                            intolerance before resuming consideration of an international convention
                            on the subject which would have resulted in further delay.</p>
                        <p>Human rights in armed conflicts were of special interest to us. We
                            favored a West European-sponsored proposal that the Assembly endorse the
                            progress achieved by the Conference of Government Experts on
                            International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts, convened
                            by the <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss> in Geneva and support the
                            convening of a diplomatic conference in 1974. Instead, the Assembly
                            approved a Swedish-Mexican resolution on which we abstained. While the
                            resolution endorsed the work being carried out by the ICRC, it called
                            for agreement on a list of contentious issues including measures to
                            prohibit use of certain weapons which we believe are more appropriately
                            considered in a disarmament context.</p>
                        <p>3. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL</p>
                        <p>Much of the Assembly action was devoted to debating and then endorsing
                            resolutions relating to actions taken by <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, and of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>'s Governing Council and the
                            reports of other UN bodies. Concentration on these economic and social
                            activities reflects the growing resources (now approximately 95 percent)
                            to the economic and social betterment of the developing world. Three
                            actions in this area were particularly meaningful:</p>
                        <p>Environment. The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the Stockholm
                            Conference Declaration on the Environment, the World Plan of Action
                            containing more than a hundred recommendations for global and regional
                            action in the environmental field and a resolution the institutional
                            arrangements. The latter resolution established: (a) a voluntary UN Fund
                            for the Environment; (b) UN Secretariat for the Environment; (c) a
                            58-nation Governing Council; and (d) a UN Environmental Board
                            responsible for inter-Secretariat coordination.</p>
                        <p>The Secretariat will be located in Nairobi, Kenya, and will be headed by
                            the unanimously elected Executive Director, Maurice Strong of Canada.
                            For reasons of cost and efficiency, we cast a lone vote against Nairobi
                            in Committee, but went along with the consensus in the plenary.</p>
                        <p>Population. A U.S.-drafted resolution on the United Nations Fund for
                            Population Activities was adopted by the plenary 106-0-20 (<gloss
                                target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>'s and some Latin American countries
                            including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Cuba) and should have a
                            far-reaching impact on the effectiveness of the UN's population
                            activities. This resolution made the UN Population Fund a part of the
                            UNDP, thereby integrating it more closely into the normal development
                            process; made by the Governing Council of the UNDP the
                            inter-governmental body responsible for giving policy guidance to the
                            field; and changed the financial regulations so that the Fund would be
                            on an annual rather than a full funding basis.</p>
                        <p>UN University After years of discussion in various UN forms the GA
                            finally adopted a resolution by an overwhelming majority, deciding to
                            establish a UN University. Despite reservations about the vagueness of
                            the plan, we voted with the majority. Based on voluntary financing, the
                            structure would consist of a program and coordinating organ and a
                            decentralized system of affiliated research institutions.</p>
                        <p>The Assembly also acted constructively on international drug abuse
                            control, adopting resolutions which called for positive action on the
                            relevant conventions, contributions to the UN Fund for Drug Abuse
                            Control, and noted the developing countries' need for technical and
                            financial aid in this field.</p>
                        <p>4. BUDGETARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES</p>
                        <p>U.S. Assessment Rate. Our major success was the approval by a substantial
                            majority (81-27-22 in the plenary) of our resolution to reduce the U.S.
                            assessment rate from 31.52 percent to 25 percent. For several months
                            prior to the vote we conducted an intensive campaign in New York, the
                            capitals and Washington. Meanwhile, the Congress had enacted legislation
                            in October which prohibited the U.S. from paying more than a 2.5 percent
                            assessment in the UN and certain specialized agencies after January 1,
                            1974. The large vote for our resolution reflected concern on the part of
                            informed member states that failure to approve it would complicate the
                            financial problems of the world organization and might lead to a
                            reduction of U.S. voluntary contributions to UN development
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Two additional resolutions relating to the scale of assessments were
                            approved during the session. The minimum rate was lowered from 0.04 to
                            0.02 percent, and additional reductions are recommended in the
                            assessment of those developing countries that pay more than the minimum
                            assessment rate but have low per capita incomes. The reduction of the
                            floor on assessments will complicate our opposition to the admission of
                            microstates on the grounds that they cannot meet the financial
                            obligations of membership.</p>
                        <p>1973 UN Regular Budget. The U.S. supported the adoption of the budget,
                            largely since it showed greater fiscal restraint than the budgets of
                            1971 and 1972, which we had not supported. The Secretary-General's
                            budget estimate of $224.2 million for calendar year 1972 was
                            subsequently revised, and additions brought the total up to $225.9
                            million. The 1973 appropriation is $12.8 million, or 6.0 Percent, above
                            the budget adopted for 1972. The $12.8 million increase is attributable
                            to net increases of $3.4 million in costs to maintain the 1972
                            establishment in 1973, $4.4 million for the existing building program in
                            Geneva, $2.0 million for a new environment secretariat in Nairobi, and
                            $3.0 for various other new programs.</p>
                        <p>Program Budgeting in the UN System. The 27th GA approved a fundamentally
                            new system of budgeting for the UN and its direct subsidiary bodies. In
                            future budget presentations all expenditures from all sources of revenue
                            (voluntary as well as assessed) will be expressed in relation to program
                            activities. The new budgets will be on a biennial basis beginning in
                            1974. The United States was one of the chief advocates of the new budget
                            format. This format is a prerequisite for program budgeting which will
                            facilitate coordination and help minimize duplication by providing
                            compatible and synchronized budgets for the UN and the specialized
                            agencies. Most of the latter already budget on a programmatic basis and
                            many employ biennial financial periods.</p>
                        <p>UN Financial Situation. The Special Committee on the Financial Situation,
                            formed at the 26th General Assembly under the chairmanship of Ambassador
                            Algard of Norway to investigate the UN financial problem and make
                            proposals for resolving it, reported a UN deficit of $86.4 million and
                            proposed a package solution involving the removal of several contentious
                            peacekeeping items from the expenditure side of the budget and the use
                            of miscellaneous income to pay for such costs. The proposal also
                            included the transfer of technical assistance from the budget to the UN
                            Development Program, which is funded from voluntary contributions. The
                            main element in the package proposal--that substantial voluntary
                            contributions be forthcoming from members to liquidate the UN
                            deficit--faltered due to Soviet intransigence on the size, shares, and
                            sequence of such contributions.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. position has been that it is willing to assist toward resolving
                            the financial problem, but only within the context of an overall
                            solution that includes substantial voluntary contributions from those
                            members who have withheld assessed payments. The General Assembly did
                            not extend the life of the Special Committee, but asked the
                            Secretary-General to explore all possibilities for an overall solution
                            of the financial difficulties and to establish a special account to
                            receive voluntary contributions. Thus, the financial problem was left
                            unsolved.</p>
                        <p>Although the United Nations was forced to operate on a thin cash margin
                            during 1972, it was able to avoid a liquidity crisis, largely because of
                            the successful efforts of the Secretary-General to bring spending in
                            line with anticipated income. Considerable opposition was expressed to
                            the SYG's underspending of appropriations, but the U.S. urged that the
                            UN continue to live within its income in the coming year.</p>
                        <p>UN Office Accommodations. The Secretary-General was authorized to
                            negotiate a rental agreement for office space in a new building to be
                            constructed by the United Nations Development Corporation across the
                            street from UN Headquarters. In committee, a Cuban proposal to defer the
                            question for a year, which would have foreclosed the opportunity for the
                            UN to have an option on the space being constructed, was approved by 35
                            to 33, with 14 abstaining. The question was reopened in the plenary, and
                            the authorization to negotiate such a lease was passed by 55 to 53, with
                            21 abstentions.</p>
                        <p>Host Country Relations. The Federal Executive Protective Service was
                            again dispatched to New York to take up guard duty where the New York
                            City police did not provide it. Despite this action, and other
                            improvements in the past year, the security situation in New York still
                            left something to be desired. Altogether in 1972 there were two
                            bombings, two assaults, six burglaries, eight hold-ups, one case of
                            breaking and entering, and 13 cases of vandalism involving UN Mission
                            members and delegates to the UN. During the GA, incidents included the
                            burglarizing of the hotel rooms of the GA President and a Nigerian GA
                            delegate, and the robbing of a Paraguayan delegate in a hotel elevator.
                            However, except for minor cases of vandalism, none of the foreign
                            missions to the UN suffered terrorist attacks. Moreover, delegates were
                            made aware of U.S. enactment on October 24, 1972, of the Act for the
                            Prohibition of Foreign Officials and Official Guests of the United
                            States, and of U.S. ratification of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
                            Relations. At the Assembly, a balanced resolution was adopted without
                            vote welcoming these U.S. actions and urging the host country to take
                            all effective measures for the protection of the diplomatic community in
                            New York.</p>

                            NATIONS AS A WHOLE, BOTH INTERNAL <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            OBSERVERS AND MANY PRESS CRITICS HAVE TENDED TO REGARD THE PERIOD AS ONE
                            OF DECLINE OF PRESTIGE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF UN AND INCREASING ISOLATION
                            FOR THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS BASIS FOR THIS ASSESSMENT, BUT THERE CAN
                            ALSO BE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF ASSESSMENT. I WOULD NOT LIKE TO LEAVE
                            MY ASSIGNMENT TO THE UN WITHOUT PUTTING ON RECORD SOME OF THESE OTHER
                            ASPECTS OF THE US POSITION IN THE UN.</p>
                        <p>2. FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES IN OTHER DELEGATIONS HAVE IN NUMBER OF
                            INSTANCES VOLUNTEERED TO USUN THAT "THIS HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD YEAR FOR
                            US, HASN'T IT?" THEY REFER TO FACT THAT WE WON DIFFICULT VICTORIES ON 25
                            PERCENT AND KOREAN INSCRIPTION ISSUES, THAT WE MADE PROGRESS ON <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS1">LOS</gloss>, ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER ITEMS, AND THAT
                            WE CAME OFF RELATIVELY WELL (AS THEY SEE IT) THEY RECOGNIZE THAT WE
                            SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF PROGRESS IN DIFFICULT AREAS SUCH AS
                            MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICAN QUESTIONS, ON TERRORISM, BUT DO NOT SEE US AS
                            HAVING BEEN HUMILIATED. WHILE WE HAVE TENDED TO JUDGE OUR EFFECTIVENESS
                            BY QUALITY OF LANGUAGE OF RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY UN MANY UN MEMBERS FOCUS
                            ON OUR "SUCCESS" IN DAMAGE LIMITATION AND IN EMERGING FROM BRUISING
                            DEBATE WITH OUR PRESTIGE AND STORE OF GOODWILL UNDAMAGED OR EVEN
                            IMPROVED. ON SUCH BASES, WE DID INDEED COME OUT PRETTY WELL IN 1972.</p>
                        <p>3. OBSERVERS WHO SEE OUR SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN TERMS OF US-SOVIET
                            COMPETITION ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WAS A GOOD
                            YEAR FOR US. OUR VICTORIES ON KOREAN INSCRIPTION AND ASSESSMENT ISSUES
                            WERE ACHIEVED IN DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH SOVIETS. ADDITIONALLY,
                            SOVIETS GOT LITTLE SATISFACTION FROM THEIR NEW RHETORICAL ISSUES
                            (NON-USE OF FORCE, DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITES), AND MADE LITTLE HEADWAY
                            ON THEIR PERENNIALS (WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE, STRENGTHENING INT'S
                            SECURITY). WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT ON THEIR MERITS NONE OF THESE DESERVED
                            GREATER ATTENTION, DESPITE THEIR "MOTHERHOOD" LABELS. WE TAKE GOOD DEAL
                            OF SATISFACTION FROM OUR SUCCESSFUL DAMAGE LIMITATION.</p>
                        <p>4. PERHAPS MORE TRULY SIGNIFICANT IS THAT IN UN PERSPECTIVE US-SOVIET
                            RIVALRY, WHILE CONTINUING, IS NO LONGER SEEN BY WORLD COMMUNITY AS
                            SINGLE DOMINATING CHARACTERISTIC OF INTERNATIONAL LIFE. SHADOW CAST BY
                            THIS RIVALRY HAS SHORTENED IN RELATIVE TERMS WHEN SET AGAINST EMERGENCE
                            OF <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> AND A NEW SELF-AWARENESS OF
                            SMALLER, POORER MEMBERS OF WORLD COMMUNITY. PERHAPS ONE OF UTILITIES OF
                            UN IS THAT IT OBLIGES OTHERWISE SELF-CENTERED NATIONS OF ALL SHAPES AND
                            SIZES TO LOOK HOWEVER MYOPICALLY AT WHOLE WORLD COMMUNITY. WE MUST IN
                            JUDGING UN FOR OURSELVES REMAIN AWARE THAT IF UN CANNOT BE MUCH BETTER
                            THAN SUM OF ITS PARTS AND THAT IF UN DID NOT EXIST, WE SHOULD STILL HAVE
                            TO FACE SAME RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDES.</p>
                        <p>5. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT US WAS THIS YEAR FREQUENTLY IN ISOLATION
                            FROM GENERAL CONSENSUS. THIS CAN RE DOCUMENTED ON POLITICAL ISSUES, BUT
                            I BELIEVE STATEMENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR TOTAL
                            POSITION. WE MUST MAKE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TACTICAL ISOLATION, AS WHEN
                            WE CHOOSE TO BE ONLY ABSTAINER ON ESTABLISHING <gloss target="#t_WDC1"
                                >WDC</gloss> STUDY COMMITTEE OR LONE "NAY" IN COMMITTEE ON KENYA'S
                            BID FOR ENVIRONMENT SECRETARIAT, AND ISOLATION ON SUBSTANCE. ON BOTH WDC
                            AND UNCHE, WE OPTED FOR UNIQUE VOTING POSITION BUT WERE BY NO MEANS
                            ALONE IN OUR SUBSTANTIVE VIEWS. ON BOTH ISSUES A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF
                            PRESTIGIOUS UN MEMBERS SHARED OUR RESERVATIONS AND NEGATIVE VIEWS BUT
                            ELECTED TO AVOID ISOLATED VOTING POSTURE.</p>
                        <p>6. ON BROAD ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE, THERE ARE VERY FEW AREAS IN WHICH WE
                            TEND TO BE GENUINELY ISOLATED. AS ISRAEL BECOMES INCREASINGLY ISOLATED,
                            US AS ISRAEL'S FOREMOST CHAMPION TENDS TO BE ISOLATED IN TURN. EVEN IN
                            THIS CASE IT IS THOUGHT THAT US HAS UNIQUE POTENTIAL FOR CATALYZING
                            NEGOTIATIONS, AND SOME ARABS WHO THINK OUR BEHAVIOR NOW PRO-ISRAELI HAVE
                            CONFIDENCE IN OUR FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS. WE HAVE BEEN PROTECTED FROM
                            ATTACKS ON OUR VIETNAM POSITION BY FACT OTHER SIDE DOES NOT WANT ISSUE
                            IN UN. ON AFRICAN ISSUES WE SOMETIMES APPEAR IN VOTING RECORDS TO BE
                            RELATIVELY ISOLATED. BUT AGAIN IN THIS INSTANCE THE ISOLATION IS MORE
                            TACTICAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE AND THE BASIC SINCERITY OF OUR BELIEF IN
                            SELF-DETERMINATION AND OUR OPPOSITION TO RACISM IS GENERALLY
                            RESPECTED.</p>
                        <p>7. OUR RELATIVE TACTICAL ISOLATION IN VOTING RECORDS HAS SOMETIMES BEEN
                            RESULT OF “BLOC VOTING”. WHILE BLOC VOTING IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD AND IN
                            SOME FORM CHARACTERIZES SOME OF WORLD'S MOST EFFECTIVE PARLIAMENTS, BLOC
                            VOTING IN UN HAS OFTEN LOWERED STANDARDS AND DISSERVED IMMEDIATE US
                            INTERESTS. REGIONAL LOYALTY FREQUENTLY LEADS AFRICANS, LATIN AMERICANS
                            AND ASIANS TO VOTE MORE OR LESS AS BLOCS DESPITE CONFLICTING INTERESTS
                            WITHIN GROUPS. EVEN THE <gloss target="#t_WEO1">WEO</gloss> GROUP VOTES
                            AS BLOC ON OCCASION. TENDENCY TO PERFORM AS BLOC TENDS TO BE GREATEST ON
                            ISSUES INVOLVING REGIONAL PRIDE--E.G., LOCATION OF A UN HEADQUARTERS IN
                            AFRICA AND CONVENING OF SECURITY COUNCIL IN A LATIN AMERICAN CAPITAL.
                            WHEN UNITY IS SOUGHT ON BASIS THIS KIND OF INHERENTLY EMOTIONAL APPEAL
                            TO GROUP LOYALTY, IT IS NOT UNNATURAL THAT VOICE OF EMOTION -- SOMETIMES
                            HIGHLY DEFENSIVE -- TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER VOICE OF REALISTIC RATIONAL
                            PRAGMATISM.</p>
                        <p>8. THERE MAY BE AN INCIPIENT COUNTER-TREND LIMITING THIS TENDENCY. IN
                            SOME INSTANCES REGIONAL GROUPS HAVE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGE IN SUFFICIENTLY
                            MODERATING THEIR POSITIONS TO PILE UP IMPRESSIVE MAJORITIES AS AGAINST
                            ADVANTAGE OF MORE EXTREME RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY BARE MAJORITIES. WHILE
                            SPONSORS OF RESOLUTIONS UNACCEPTABLE TO US ARE NO LONGER PREDISPOSED TO
                            MODIFY THEM JUST TO GET US VOTE, HOWEVER, ON KEY ISSUES, WHERE US ACTION
                            OR MONEY IS REQUIRED, NECESSITY OF US SUPPORT, OR AT LEAST
                            NON-OPPOSITION, IS RECOGNIZED AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS ARE OFTEN MODIFIED
                            ACCORDINGLY. TENDENCY TOWARD BLOC VOTING CAN USUALLY BE COUNTERED
                            SUCCESSFULLY IF TIMELY AND DETERMINED EFFORT CAN BE MADE TO SHOW
                            INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF REGIONAL GROUPS THAT THEIR HARD INTERESTS,
                            PARTICULARLY THEIR IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL INTERESTS, ARE AT STAKE. FOR
                            EXAMPLE, ON 25 PERCENT ASSESSMENT ISSUE, OR PROPOSAL WAS NOT VERY
                            ATTRACTIVE TO MANY UN MEMBERS. WE WERE ABLE NONETHELESS NOT ONLY TO
                            PREVENT BLOC OPPOSITION BUT ALSO TO OBTAIN STRONG MAJORITY SUPPORT IN
                            AFRICAN GROUP BY EMPHASIZING RELEVANCE OF ISSUE TO CONTINUED STRONG US
                            SUPPORT OF <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss> AND OTHER VOLUNTARY
                            AGENCIES.</p>
                        <p>9. FACT THAT SMALLER AND POORER COUNTRIES TEND TO BE RELATIVELY PRAGMATIC
                            IN VIEWING SHORT-RANGE ECONOMIC INTERESTS AGAINST BACKGROUND OF US
                            STRENGTH IN ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND OF OUR INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENT MAY BE
                            IMPORTANT REASON WHY US PRESTIGE REMAINS RELATIVELY HIGH AMONG THOSE
                            DELEGATIONS REPRESENTING COUNTRIES WHOSE PRIMARY MOTIVATION IN UN GAME
                            IS DESIRE TO RECEIVE DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS.</p>
                        <p>10. AMONG TRIALS WE STILL FACE IN UN IS FACTOR THAT RELATES TO BUT GOES
                            BEYOND BLOC VOTING PHENOMENON. THIS FACTOR IS GROWING COHESION OF
                            MAJORITY OF POORER, WEAKER, SMALLER NATIONS IN UN WHO ARE AWARE THAT
                            RICH, LARGE, POWERFUL NATIONS ARE IN MINORITY AND CAN BE OUT-VOTED. IN
                            SHORT-RUN AT LEAST, THIS TREND IMPLIES DIFFICULTIES. IN MORE GENERAL WAY
                            WE CAN OBSERVE THAT HAVE-NOT NATIONS ARE FREQUENTLY TEMPTED TO SEEK
                            SHORT-RUN ADVANTAGE, INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE, AT EXPENSE OF
                            WHAT WE REGARD AS PRINCIPLE. "HAVE" NATIONS ARE BY NO MEANS IMMUNE FROM
                            THIS SORT OF TEMPTATION. MOST OF FOUNDING FATHERS OF UN CONSIDERED, OR
                            PRETENDED TO CONSIDER, SANCTITY OF PROPERTY, INVIOLABILITY OF CONTRACTS
                            AND AGREEMENTS, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW TO BE OF FUNDAMENTAL
                            IMPORTANCE, BUT POORER COUNTRIES NOW DO NOT FIND THESE VALUES SO
                            IMPORTANT. IT MAY BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY DO SO. MEANWHILE, THIRD WORLD
                            TENDENCIES IN THIS DIRECTION HAVE BEGUN TO CREATE CERTAIN MUTUALITY OF
                            INTEREST AMONG "HAVES" OF VARYING IDEOLOGY THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY
                            EXIST.</p>
                        <p>11. IN SUM, AS I LOOK BACK OVER MY EXPERIENCE AT UN OVER PAST TWO YEARS,
                            I AM NOT TEMPTED TO ENGAGE IN HAND-WRINGING. I AM CRITICAL, HOPEFULLY
                            CONSTRUCTIVELY SO, OF ASPECTS OF UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATIONS, AND I
                            BELIEVE THAT IN BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE GOING TO FACE RECURRENT
                            FRUSTRATIONS. HOWEVER, NOW THAT I KNOW IT AT FIRST HAND, I BELIEVE IN
                            THE INSTITUTION MORE STRONGLY THAN WHEN I CAME TO NEW YORK. THE UN
                            SYSTEM HAS ALREADY MADE AND IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO
                            WELFARE OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF ALL MANKIND, PARTICULARLY ON THE ECONOMIC
                            AND SOCIAL SIDE. THERE IS GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT IN THESE AREAS
                            EFFECTIVENESS OF UN ACTIVITIES NEEDS IMPROVING, AND I BELIEVE THIS
                            PROCESS IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. IN MY VIEW, LIMITATIONS TO SUCCESS ON
                            POLITICAL SIDE ARE OFTEN INHERENT IN ASSOCIATION OF SOVEREIGN STATES AND
                            REFLECT LESS STRONGLY ON VALIDITY OF UN STRUCTURE THAN ON SOUNDNESS AND
                            WISDOM OF GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ITS CONSTITUENTS. THE UN IS SLOWLY
                            BECOMING MORE LIKE A PARLIAMENT, A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A DIPLOMATIC
                            INSTITUTION. I HAVE FOUND IT EXCITING AND CHALLENGING TO REPRESENT US IN
                            THIS POLITICAL ARENA AND HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR
                            FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES AT UN IF WE MAKE THE EFFORT--AND THAT IT IS WORTH
                            THE EFFORT. XGDS <lb/>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName> would be--will be some

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I was so amused when I was
                            talking to <persName corresp="#p_HERG1">Heath</persName> at the dinner,
                            at the White House dinner. I said, "Are you"--It's one of the few times
                            I [unclear]. I said, "By any chance, would you be coming over, to speak
                            to the U.N. sometime." [Unclear] He said, "Frankly, I abhor the place so
                            much that I just can't bring myself to come."</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: [laughs]</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Goddamit the British are sick of the U.N. What's turned them off
                            on it so much? </p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, on all these racial problems, all their African
                            problems, and then at Suez. It's always that double standard.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: It just--Just remember, I will never go before them again.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: No.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: I'm not going to do it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: No.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Even with Scali there and all the rest. I mean, I wouldn't do it
                            even with [George H.W.] <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>.
                            They don't care who's there. The U.N., now, that's the job of the
                            Secretary of State--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: And, actually, they--you were there twice and they treated you
                            really--</p>
                        <p>Nixon: I was snubbed both times. Basically, not only--not only by the
                            membership of the U.N., but also, let's face it, by the damn
                            Secretariat.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Oh--</p>
                        <p>Nixon: The whole staff. Remember how they treated us?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, it was--</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Waiting around.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, that <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> said
                            he couldn't greet you at the door because he was at the...</p>
                        <p>Nixon: At some meeting--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: ...at the dinner of the Pakistan ambassador. It's an outrage.
                            And then this idea, well, you don't know whether the [unclear] are made
                            to sit on the floor listening to <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile
                                Selassie</persName> speak. I mean that's just ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Yeah, sitting there and everybody--nobody got up when we came in,
                            anything like that. I think with the U.N. just a cool detachment is what
                            is required now. I gave a 25th anniversary dinner for ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Oh, yeah.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: And we've done everything. I've gone the extra mile, but they say
                            I haven't-- </p>
                        <p>Kissinger: And you spoke to them twice--</p>
                        <p>Nixon: I want you to have, incidentally, a talk with Scali soon.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Right.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Before he gets up there, and to tell him: "Now look, John, there's
                            one thing understood, that you can in no circumstances count on: Your
                            job at the U.N., your work -- I mean you're going to have to work with
                            us and so forth and so on, but the president is not going to be
                            available to go to the U.N."</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Right.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Not in this term. We've done it twice now. And I don't want him
                            to--you know what I mean? [Kurt] <persName corresp="#p_WK5"
                                >Waldheim</persName> will be after us to come up for something or
                            other, or now this is a special deal and how about coming? Henry, I
                            think the U.N.--I think the American public now is getting really pissed
                            off at it. And I think what was the straw that broke the camel's
                            back--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Was this.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: --was this hijacking</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Oh, this hijacking?</p>
                        <p>Nixon: [Unclear] go on. You know, they don't even--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: --support us on hijacking.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: The right of liberation, I think also their figures would support
                            us in Vietnam you know.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, also the way they jumped up and down when Nationalist
                            China was evicted.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: That was a horrible thing--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That was revolting.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Remember how they danced?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: It was revolting.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Oh, yeah. A bunch of apes. Well--</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Right.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Have a good time in New York. When are you going to go?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I'll go about 3:30, 4 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Nixon: Where? You're going...</p>

                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>The meeting began at 11:43 a.m. with the President and Ambassador Scali
                            walking around the Rose Garden for press photos. Upon their return to
                            the Oval Office, the President asked Ambassador Scali when he planned to
                            depart. Scali said he would present his credentials when
                            Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName>
                            returned from Bangladesh. The President thereupon observed that he
                            thought Waldheim not too strong a Secretary-General, but better than
                                <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName>. He asked that Scali
                            give Waldheim his regards and tell him on Scali's behalf that his
                            predecessor had leaned constantly toward Communist countries. We would
                            hope that Waldheim would not lean in any direction at all. The President
                            asked that Scali point out to Waldheim that the situation was difficult
                            in terms of financial support for the UN. We will do what we can for the
                            UN, but Congress is responsible for our inability to do more. Nothing
                            has hurt the UN more with the American people, said the President, than
                            the failure to act on terrorism. It is difficult to understand how we
                            can be in a position of being the major supporter of the UN and yet
                            unable to get a resolution which all countries should naturally want to
                            support. The President noted, however, that the UN had made progress on
                            environmental matters and in peacekeeping operations.</p>
                        <p>The President told Scali that with regard to the Middle East we were
                            following two approaches -- an open approach by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> and through our private contacts
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Egyptians and the
                            Israelis. He, Scali, must know nothing officially of any of these
                            private approaches. It is important for him to know for his own
                            background that they exist but he should keep totally to the public
                            line. The President noted that we were the only friend of the Israelis
                            and that Israel has only contempt for the UN. We cannot allow Mrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> to keep her present
                            totally intransigent attitude, and Scali might be able to float some
                            ideas through his contacts that could be useful. The President doubted
                            that the Middle East would ever be totally settled, but felt that we
                            should get started on something and that a private channel would best
                            serve our interests. A private channel is preferable for negotiations
                            because if talks in the public channel were to fail, the result would be
                            catastrophic. The public channel is useful when we know that we will
                            succeed. The President cautioned that this was a tough issue and that
                            Scali should maintain close contact with State and the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on it.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked what Scali planned to do at the UN, and Scali
                            responded that he intended to be a spokesman for the President and the
                            US on our foreign policy as a whole. In his appearance the previous
                            Sunday on ISSUES AND ANSWERS, he said he had observed that the
                            President's visits to the USSR and <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            had opened up initiatives which contributed to world peace, and the
                            result had therefore not had the effect of bypassing the UN. Scali said
                            that he would not hesitate to speak out strongly for the US and that he
                            planned to make substantial changes in his staff in the direction of a
                            tougher approach. He planned to bring in as ambassadors a woman and a
                            black and noted that there were only two blacks on his staff. The
                            President concurred strongly and pointed out that since the UN was
                            mostly non-white we should have more blacks on the staff. Scali pointed
                            out that the UN was the only embassy staff without a living allowance
                            and that New York was so expensive that it hampered him in his selection
                            of people. For example, he said he would have liked to have obtained
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Brown</persName> (Jordan), but
                            that Brown could not afford to live in New York City. The President
                            suggested that Scali talk with Congressman Rooney and point out to him
                            that the lack of a living allowance meant that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> staff was able to attract only rich
                            dilettantes and that we need instead some sound, hard workers.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he knew he was not a popular figure in the UN but
                            that Scali, with his experience, could move among the other Ambassadors
                            and help to explain things. The UN, for example, should be even handed
                            toward the US and smaller states should not "gang up" against the big
                            powers. The President felt that the British had only contempt for the UN
                            and the French had little use for it. The UN needs to regain some
                            stature and the President said he would be delighted if the UN could
                            accomplish something.</p>
                        <p>Scali thought that if Waldheim were to chair the upcoming International
                            Conference, it would enhance his reputation and that of the UN. The
                            President asked that Scali tell Waldheim that and also point out that
                            the tendency in the Conference would be to be harsh towards South
                            Vietnam. We would expect Waldheim to insist on even-handed treatment,
                            and how he handled it would be a test of his relationship with the US.
                            At Scali's suggestion, the President agreed to invite Waldheim to
                            Washington for a visit if his conduct had earned such a reward. Scali
                            said that he would be advising the President in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Scali expressed his appreciation to the President for bringing him into
                            the White House family and for subsequently giving him this new, very
                            responsible job. He expressed his total dedication to giving the
                            President the very best support possible. The President responded that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had felt that Scali should not
                            get the UN job because of his news media background, but that the
                            President had insisted. The President observed that Kissinger and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> were now pleased with
                            the selection.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his delight in the performance of the released
                            POWs and likened the impact of this event to that of Neil Armstrong
                            stepping onto the moon. The President thought that it was very good for
                            the US to see some brave men and to have some heroes.</p>
                        <p>The President then suggested that Scali read the Fairley book on Kennedy,
                            at least that portion beginning with Chapter 11. He observed that it was
                            a very interesting book for its analysis of foreign policy and of the
                            handling of problems of international commitments and expectations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we do not intend to lecture countries on their
                            internal structure, either in cases like that of the Philippines at
                            present, or that of Communist countries. Our concern is for foreign
                            policy behavior and we will aid dictatorships if it is in our interest
                            to do so. Our opposition to Cuba, PRC and the USSR has been based on
                            their external policy of aggression and subversion. When they modify
                            those policies, we will modify our policy toward them. Cuba, in this
                            regard, has not yet changed. The President then noted that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EAL1">Echeverria</persName> had been behaving
                            very badly toward the US, both in his speech at the UN, and in his
                            public utterances in Mexico. The President said he had personal
                            affection for Echeverria but that it was difficult for him to understand
                            why countries like Mexico were always attacking the US. We do not ask
                            other countries for their affection, but only to be treated fairly.
                            Countries which continually attack the US can no longer expect to get
                            aid and Scali should point that out in his discussions in the UN. The
                            Congress was becoming increasingly opposed to aid programs in general,
                            and would refuse such aid to countries which were condemning US policy.
                            The President said that the US was tired of the double standard used by
                            many countries in comparing the US and Communist behavior. The President
                            concluded the discussion by telling Scali not to be belligerent on this
                            issue, but he pointed out that a little moral indignation is sometimes
                            appropriate. He suggested that Scali make his statements on this issue
                            in front of the TV camera so that he could not be misquoted.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded at 12:25 p.m.</p>

                            <lb/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">John Scali</persName>,
                            Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations
                            <lb/>Ambassador Christopher Phillips, Deputy Permanent Representative of
                            the United States to the United Nations</p>
                        <p>DATE: February 20, 1973</p>
                        <p>During the discussion which followed Ambassador Scali's presentation of
                            his credentials the Secretary General touched on the following
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>1. Opportunities for the United Nations in the Wake of Recent Bilateral
                            Agreements </p>
                        <p>Stressing that he was a realist and understood the vital importance of
                            accommodation between the great powers, the Secretary General believed
                            that bilateral negotiations should not be to the exclusion of political
                            cooperation within a multilateral framework. In this connection, he did
                            not conceive of the United Nations as providing only a framework for
                            international cooperation on economic and social activities. The
                            fundamental purpose of the United Nations was to maintain peace and
                            security and this must continue to be the primary objective of the
                            Organization.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Scali commented that the new spirit of detente generated by
                            successful U.S. bilateral initiatives had created a more fluid situation
                            in the world and this, in turn, opened up new opportunities for the
                            United Nations. It would be his goal to help the United Nations achieve
                            more visible successes, thus enhancing the Organization's prestige and
                            contributing to increased American support for the United Nations. He
                            assured the Secretary General that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> was firmly committed to the United Nations. While
                            recognizing the importance of recent bilateral successes, the President
                            appreciated the value of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
                            providing an international framework for institutionalizing peace
                            agreements and for mobilizing world support behind them.</p>
                        <p>2. United States Financial Support for the United Nations </p>
                        <p>The Secretary General felt that the General Assembly's decision to
                            support a reduction in the U.S. assessment to 25 per cent was a
                            reflection of a more realistic attitude by most Member States towards
                            the Organization. He very much hoped that the United States, now that it
                            had achieved its 25 per cent goal, would take steps to increase its
                            contributions to the voluntary programs, especially <gloss
                                target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>. In this connection, he expressed
                            warm appreciation for U.S. support of the UN narcotics control programs
                            and for the one million dollar additional contribution he had just
                            received for the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the UN deficit problem, the Secretary General took some
                            encouragement from the increasing number of voluntary contributions
                            which have been made or pledged by Member States toward debt reduction.
                            During his recent visit to Japan he had received assurances of a
                            voluntary contribution of $10 million towards debt reduction. He
                            cautioned that for domestic political reasons the Japanese had asked him
                            not to reveal this information at the present time. The Japanese have
                            also pledged $50 million towards a UN program for Vietnamese relief and
                            rehabilitation. This information also was to be kept confidential for
                            the time being.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General expressed his satisfaction over assurances he had
                            received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">Bush</persName>
                            that should the Soviet Union agree to make a substantial voluntary
                            payment towards debt reduction, the Administration would seek
                            Congressional approval to write off some $16 million owed to the United
                            States by the United Nations. He said he had passed this information on
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MJA4">Malik</persName> but to date
                            had received no response from the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General noted that by maintaining a policy of financial
                            austerity last year he had achieved savings of $4 million which had been
                            "put on the shelf". He intended to continue this policy during the
                            current year despite efforts by some Members to apply such savings
                            towards a reduction of Members' assessments.</p>

                            UNIVERSITY. (IN INFORMAL CORRIDOR ENCOUNTER HE HAD PREVIOUSLY THANKED
                            SCALI FOR FAVORABLE REMARKS.) WALDHEIM SAID HE WISHED TO THANK SCALI NOT
                            ONLY FOR REFERENCES TO HIMSELF BUT ALSO FOR GENERAL SUPPORT OF UN. "WE
                            HAVE VERY SIMILAR APPROACHES." (SCALI INTERJECTED THAT SPEECH HAD NOT
                            BEEN MEANT AS SUPERFICIAL EXERCISE.) SCALI AND WALDHEIM AGREED ON

                            STATED INTER ALIA THAT SOUTH KOREA WOULD NOT OBJECT TO: (A) NORTH-KOREAN
                            PARTICIPATION IN UNGA DEBATE; (B) NORTH KOREAN PARTICIPATION IN

                        <p>5. CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS. LAST YEAR INTERNATIONAL LAW
                            COMMISSION SUBMITTED DRAFT ARTICLES ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS, COVERING
                            SERIOUS CRIMES AGAINST DIPLOMATS AND OTHER INTERNATIONALLY PROTECTED
                            PERSONS. DRAFT REQUIRES STATE PARTY TO EXTRADITE OR SUBMIT FOR
                            PROSECUTION ALLEGED OFFENDER FOUND ON ITS TERRITORY. 27TH UNGA REQUESTED
                            COMMENT ON ARTICLES "WITH A VIEW TO FINAL ELABORATION" OF CONVENTION AT
                            28TH UNGA. US EXPECTS AND STRONGLY SUPPORTS COMPLETION OF CONVENTION ON
                            SCHEDULE. WE HOPE OTHER GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT CURRENT ORDER OF ITEMS
                            ON PROVISIONAL AGENDA WHICH GIVES THIS ITEM HIGH PRIORITY (SECOND) ON
                            SIXTH COMMITTEE AGENDA. REMAINING TECHNICAL DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED
                            DURING UNGA. WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO DISCUSS PRIOR TO UNGA ANY PROBLEMS
                            OTHER GOVTS MAY HAVE WITH DRAFT ARTICLES.</p>
                        <p>6. TERRORISM. AD HOC COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM HAS REFLECTED SAME POLITICAL
                            DIFFERENCES WHICH FRUSTRATED EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ACTION LAST YEAR. (E.G.
                            ARAB OPPOSITION OVER PALESTINE QUESTION AND AFRICAN PREOCCUPATION WITH
                            LEGITIMACY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS). NON-ALIGNED MEMBERS OF
                            COMMITTEE SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THREE SUBCOMMITTEES OF THE WHOLE TO
                            CONSIDER SEQUENTIALLY DEFINITION OF TERRORISM, ITS CAUSES, AND POSSIBLE
                            MEASURES TO COMBAT IT. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT, WHILE CONSIDERATION
                            OF CAUSES IS LEGITIMATE FUNCTION OF UN, ATTENTION SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED
                            ON CONCRETE MEASURES DESIGNED TO PREVENT ACTS, DIRECTED AT INNOCENT
                            PERSONS, WHICH ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REGARDLESS OF
                            MOTIVE OR CAUSE. IN OUR VIEW SUCH MEASURES SHOULD NOT AWAIT RESULT OF
                            WORK ON CAUSES, AND ATTEMPT AT DEFINITION OF TERRORISM IS
                            UNDESIRABLE.</p>
                        <p>7. WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE (<gloss target="#t_WDC1">WDC</gloss>). US
                            RECOGNIZES WDC COULD PLAY USEFUL ROLE AT APPROPRIATE TIME. HOWEVER, WDC
                            WOULD NOT CONTRIBUTE AT THIS TIME TO ACHIEVING CONCRETE ARMS CONTROL
                            AGREEMENTS AND COULD HARM SERIOUS DISARMAMENT DISCUSSIONS IN OTHER
                            FORUMS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT SUPPORTED EFFORTS LOOKING TO EARLY
                            CONVENING OF WDC. WE ABSTAINED ON LAST YEAR'S WDC RES WHICH CREATED
                            35-MEMBER SPECIAL COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE BELIEVED THERE WAS NO NEED FOR
                            FURTHER STUDY OF MEMBERS' VIEWS. US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            FRANCE AND <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN
                            SPECIAL COMMITTEE, AND WE WOULD NOT CONSIDER IT PROPER FOR COMMITTEE
                            WHICH HAS BEENUNABLE TO HOLD FORMAL MEETING TO SUBMIT REPORT TO UNGA
                            CALLED FOR BY 27TH UNGA RES.</p>
                        <p>8. NON—USE OF FORCE (<gloss target="#t_NUF1">NUF</gloss>). LAST YEAR'S
                            UNGA PASSED NUF RESOLUTION WHICH RENOUNCED USE OR THREAT OF FORCE IN
                            ACCORDANCE WITH UN CHARTER AND "PERMANENT PROHIBITION OF USE OF NUCLEAR
                            WEAPONS", AND RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTING ACTION BY <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>. WE ABSTAINED ON RES, WHICH BEGAN AS SOVIET INITIATIVE,
                            ON GROUNDS IT TENDED TO DETRACT FROM UN CHARTER, WHICH IN OUR VIEW
                            PROVIDES BASIC GUIDELINE FOR INTERNATIONAL CONDUCT AND SHOULD NOT BE
                            SELECTIVELY REINTERPRETED. CHARTER DRAWS IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN
                            LEGITIMATE AND UNLAWFUL USES OF FORCE, WHICH NUF RESOLUTION DOES NOT. WE
                            HAVE OPPOSED SC CONSIDERATION OF ISSUE AND SEE NO POINT IN FURTHER
                            DISCUSSION OF NUF IN UNGA. RECENT US—SOVIET AGREEMENT ON PREVENTION OF
                            NUCLEAR WAR, WHICH INCLUDES AGREEMENT TO REFRAIN FROM THREAT OR USE OF
                            FORCE, MAY BE RAISED IN RELATION TO NUF ITEM. WE BELIEVE THIS AGREEMENT
                            DIFFERS BASICALLY FROM NUF RES IN THAT IT EMPHASIZES PREVENTION OF
                            NUCLEAR WAR, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO BAN ON USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN WAR
                            OR TO IMPLEMENTING ROLE FOR SC.</p>
                        <p>9. NAPALM AND OTHER INCENDIARIES. PURSUANT TO SECRETARIAT STUDY CALLED
                            FOR BY UNGA ON NAPALM AND OTHER INCENDIARIES, SEVERAL COUNTRIES MAY NOW
                            PRESS FOR ACTION TO CONTROL OR BAN THESE WEAPONS. WE DID NOT PARTICIPATE
                            IN PREPARATION OF SECRETARY—GENERAL'S REPORT ON SUBJECT AND WE ABSTAINED
                            ON LAST YEAR'S UNGA RES WHICH REQUESTED CIRCULATION OF REPORT TO MEMBERS
                            FOR COMMENT. WE DO NOT INTEND TO COMMENT ON REPORT. US POSITION IS
                            NAPALM AND OTHER INCENDIARIES ARE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS AND NOT SEPARATE
                            AND UNIQUE CATEGORY. ANY FURTHER UN ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THAT
                            CONTEXT BY UNGA'S FIRST (POLITICAL) COMMITTEE.</p>
                        <p>10. MIDDLE EAST. AFTER RECENT SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE ON OVERALL MIDDLE
                            EAST SITUATION (CULMINATING IN US VETO OF ONE-SIDED DRAFT WHICH RISKED
                            UNDERMINING SC RES 242) AND SUBSEQUENT SESSION ON ISRAEL AIRCRAFT
                            DIVERSION INCIDENT, IT IS LIKELY EGYPT WILL WISH GENERAL DEBATE ON
                            MIDDLE EAST QUESTION IN UNGA. EGYPTIANS MAY SEE NON-ALIGNED CONSENSUS
                            EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM ALGIERS CONFERENCE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AS
                            SPRINGBOARD FOR GENERAL UNGA RESOLUTION FAVORABLE TO THEM. POSSIBLY

                            AUGUST-EARLY SEPTEMBER) TO MIDDLE EAST WILL INFLUENCE UNGA DEBATE ON
                            QUESTION. PAST EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT UNGA DEBATE ON MIDDLE EAST
                            EXACERBATES TENSIONS AND HARDEN POSITIONS. IN PREVIOUS UNGAS POSITIONS
                            AT VARIANCE WITH SC RES 242 HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND INCREASED ISRAELI
                            DISENCHANTMENT WITH UN AS INSTRUMENTALITY IN SEARCH FOR PEACE.</p>
                        <p>11. AFRICAN ISSUES. (A) WE ANTICIPATE RHODESIA WILL BE FOCUS OF AFRICAN
                            HEAT ON US IN 28TH UNGA. WE MUST EXPECT RESOLUTION ON SANCTIONS PROGRAM
                            CONTAINING PARAGRAPH SINGLING OUT US FOR SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS THROUGH
                            BYRD AMENDMENT PERMITTING US IMPORTS OF RHODESIAN CHROME. WE BELIEVE
                            THOSE INTERESTED IN UPHOLDING SANCTIONS SHOULD ADDRESS STATES WHICH
                            PERMIT PURCHASES OF VAST MAJORITY OF ILLEGALLY-TRADED RHODESIAN PRODUCTS
                            RATHER THAN US FOR SMALL AMOUNT IMPORTED UNDER BYRD AMENDMENT
                            PROVISIONS. (B) WE FORESEE FURTHER EFFORTS TO SECURE OFFICIAL
                            RECOGNITION FOR PORTUGUESE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT
                            AGREE TO SUCH STATUS, WE HOPE TO AVOID CONFRONTATION ON THIS ISSUE. WE
                            COULD CONTEMPLATE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION IN UNGA COMMITTEES ON CASE BY
                            CASE BASIS BY NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT REPRESENTATIVES ON MATTERS
                            RELATING TO THEIR TERRITORIES AND IN WHICH THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO WORK
                            OF SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS. WE EXPECT CHARGES OF PORTUGUESE MASSACRES IN
                            MOZAMBIQUE AND OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN REPRESSION IN NAMIBIA MAY MOVE
                            AFRICANS TO PROD US TO JOIN IN CONDEMNATIONS. THIS REGARD WE ARE WILLING
                            TO STUDY ANY EVIDENCE PRESENTED. THERE ALSO MAY BE EFFORT TO APPROVE
                            RECOMMENDATIONS OF UN/<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> OSLO
                            CONFERENCE ON APARTHEID AND COLONIALISM. WE ARE WILLING TO HAVE UNGA
                            TAKE NOTE OF OSLO CONFERENCE BUT ITS 127 RECOMMENDATIONS - MANY OF THEM
                            UNACCEPTABLE TO US - WOULD REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL CONSIDERATION.</p>
                        <p>12. HUMAN RIGHTS. OM DECEMBER 10, 1973, UNGA WILL MARK 25TH ANNIVERSARY
                            OF UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. WE INTEND TO EMPHASIZE NEED TO
                            IMPROVE UN EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS AREA THROUGH BROADER-GAUGED TREATMENT
                            OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS. HEAVY EMPHASIS OM RACIAL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE
                            BALANCED BY MORE ATTENTION TO OTHER PROBLEM AREAS, E.G., FREEDOM OF
                            MOVEMENT AND EXPRESSION, RIGHTS OF NON-CITIZEN RESIDENTS. WE WILL
                            SUPPORT CURRENT VERSION OF DRAFT PROGRAM FOR DECADE FOR ACTION TO COMBAT
                            RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FAVOR
                            ESTABLISHMENT OF UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AS MEANS FOR
                            PROMOTING EVEN-HANDED, OBJECTIVE TREATMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS QUESTIONS. TO
                            FOCUS ATTENTION UPON BASIC RIGHT OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SO IMPORTANT IN
                            AMERICAN TRADITION, WE WILL AGAIN ATTACH HIGH PRIORITY TO DRAFTING OF
                            DECLARATION ON ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.</p>
                        <p>13. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. US WILL RESIST ANY EFFORT REOPEN 25 PERCENT
                            ASSESSMENT ISSUE, SETTLED IN PRINCIPLE IN 1972, AND WORK FOR UNGA

                            CEILING ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ANY ONE MEMBER STATE. US BELIEVES IN
                            CONTINUING NEED FOR AUSTERITY IN UN FINANCES AND SUPPORTS MEASURES
                            INITIATED BY <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> IN 1972. IN PARTICULAR,
                            IT IS IMPORTANT SYG MAINTAIN POLICY OF LIMITING EXPENDITURES TO LEVEL OF
                            ANTICIPATED INCOME, (SO SHORTFALL THROUGH APPEARANCES OF WITHHOLDING
                            FROM ASSESSMENTS DOES NO INCREASE DEFICITS OR CONTRIBUTIONS OF OTHERS).
                            REDUCTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CAN INCREASE PROGRAM FUNDS. IMPACT OF
                            DOLLAR DEVALUATION ON BUDGETS OF MOST UN AGENCIES HAS LED TO DISCUSSION
                            OF (A) DENOMINATING BUDGETS IN ANOTHER CURRENCY AND (B) PROVISION FOR
                            PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS PARTLY IN DOLLARS AND PARTLY IN CURRENCY IN WHICH
                            MAJOR PORTION OF EXPENDITURES MADE. THERE LITTLE POSSIBILITY OF OPTION
                            (A) GENERATING MUCH STEAM, BUT THERE MAY BE SUPPORT FOR (B). WE BELIEVE
                            DOLLAR HAS PROVED ADVANTAGEOUS TO UN SYSTEM FOR 25 YEARS AND WILL
                            CONTINUE TO BE SO. FEW COUNTRIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM CHANGE IN CURRENCY
                            OF ACCOUNT AT PRESENT. AUTHORITATIVE OPINION HOLDS DOLLAR IS UNDERVALUED
                            AND MAY BE EXPECTED TO APPRECIATE. IT WOULD RE PRUDENT TO AWAIT
                            ACHIEVEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM OF STABLE CURRENCIES BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS
                            WHICH COULD BE TO LONG TERM DISADVANTAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS CONCERNED.</p>

                            ALSO NEED ASSISTANCE FROM FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND THROUGH ECONOMIC AND

                        <p>1. SUMMARY: MONTHS FOLLOWING SEPT 5-9 ALGIERS CONFERENCE HAVE SEEM MARKED
                            INTENSIFICATION OF LONG-TERM TREND TOWARDS GREATER COORDINATION OF
                            NON-ALIGNED BLOCS' EFFORTS WITHIN UN. DEGREE OF UNITY SHOWN BY
                            SUB-SAHARA AFRICANS ON QUESTIONS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA AND BY ARABS IN
                            ISSUES RELATED TO ISRAEL CAN PERHAPS BE UNDERSTOOD IN LIGHT OF THEIR
                            GROWING FRUSTRATION WITH STATUS QUO. WHAT IS NEW AND POTENTIALLY
                            ALARMING IS THE DEGREE OF MUTUAL, UNQUALIFIED, AND GENERALLY EFFECTIVE
                            SUPPORT EACH GROUP IS GIVING THE OTHER ON THESE RESPECTIVE ISSUES, AND
                            THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE CONCERTED THEIR POSITIONS ON MORE
                            PERIPHERAL QUESTIONS, SUCH AS PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS, DISARMAMENT, AND
                            UN BUDGET. NON-ALIGNEDS HAVE VOTES TO DOMINATE MOST ASPECTS OF UN
                            ACTIVITIES, AND TO PARALYZE THE REST, IT THEY SO CHOOSE. ON MOST
                            QUESTIONS OF CONCERN TO THE NON-ALIGNED, THE U.S. IS SEEN AS A PRINCIPAL
                            OBSTACLE TO THE SORT OF DIRECT UN ACTION THEY SUPPORT. IF THE NON
                            ALIGNED ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENT MOMENTUM TOWARDS CONCERTED
                            ACTION, THE US IS LIKELY TO FIND ITSELF INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, AND
                            OVERRIDDEN IN UN FORUMS. END SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>2. THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF NONALIGNED BLOCK HAS OVER PAST DECADE SHIFTED
                            TO ITS ARAB-AFRICAN CORE, LEAVING MUCH OF THE MOVEMENTS ORIGINAL
                            LEADERSHIP (INDIA, INDONESIA, EVEN YUGOSLAVIA) ON THE FRINGES. PRESENT
                            NONALIGNED SOLIDARITY APPEARS TO BE BASED ON SHARED INTEREST IN ECONOMIC
                            DEVELOPMENT, PLUS AN IMPLICIT TRADE OFF BETWEEN THE ARABS AND THE
                            AFRICANS OF SUPPORT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST WHAT THEY SEE
                            AS RESIDUAL WESTERN ENCLAVES IN THEIR AREAS OF THE WORLD, I.E. ISRAEL
                            AND THE WHITE REGIMES OF SOUTHERN AFRICA. INCREASED IN COHESION AMONG
                            NONALIGNED MAY RESULT FROM FRUSTRATION WITH STATUS QUO, INABILITY TO
                            FIND SUPPORT ELSEWHERE, AND PERHAPS A GROWING SOPHISTICATION AMONG
                            NONALIGNED MEMBERS, AS WEAK NEW STATES BECOME AWARE OF THE LIMITS OF
                            UNILATERAL OR EVEN REGIONAL ACTION, AND THE NEED TO ATTRACT THE MOST
                            WIDESPREAD SUPPORT POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>3. MOST SPECTACULAR EXHIBITION OF NONALIGNED SOLIDARITY TO DATE HAS BEEN
                            RUPTURE OF RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL BY 22 AFRICAN STATES FOLLOWING THE
                            ALGIERS CONFERENCE AND OUTBREAK OF MIDDLE EAST HOSTILITIES. ARABS HAVE
                            SHOWN ABILITY TO COORDINATE THEIR RECENT ACTION IN THE UN AND HAVE
                            RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FROM THEIR NONALIGNED COLLEAGUES, THE
                            EFFECTIVENESS OF WHICH WAS DEMONSTRATED BY NONALIGNED ROLE IN SETTING UP
                            AND STAFFING <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>. TO DATE NONALIGNED
                            CONTRIBUTION IN THE S.C. TO UN ACTION ON MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN GENERALLY
                            CONSTRUCTIVE. HOWEVER, SHOULD ARAB STATES DIRECTLY CONCERNED WISH IN
                            FUTURE TO FRUSTRATE UN ACTION, IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THEY COULD COUNT
                            ON SUPPORT OF MOST OF NONALIGNED.</p>
                        <p>4. PERHAPS MOST ALARMING IN TERMS OF FUTURE OF UN AS AN INSTITUTION IS
                            NONALIGNED CHALLENGE TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON
                            ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY QUESTIONS, AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE ABILITY
                            OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO MAINTAIN SOME DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER UN
                            PROGRAMS AND BUDGET. IN MOST INSTANCES NONALIGNED VOTING STRENGTH ONLY
                            GIVES POWER TO BLOCK UN ACTION, OR TO PASS ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS
                            RESOLUTIONS. ON PROGRAM AND BUDGETARY MATTERS, HOWEVER NONALIGNED ACTION
                            CAN AND DOES RESULT IN <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> DECISION WHICH
                            ARE BINDING ON ALL MEMBERS. THUS IRRESPONSIBLE MANIPULATION OF UN BUDGET
                            BY NONALIGNED COULD QUICKLY CREATE SITUATION IN WHICH ONLY US OPTIONS
                            WOULD BE TO PAY AS DIRECTED, OR WITHHOLD CONTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION OF
                            OBLIGATIONS UNDER UN CHARTER. MISSION HAS REPORTED NONALIGNED EFFORT TO
                            DISCREDIT <gloss target="#t_ACABQ1">ACABQ</gloss>, AND TO INCREASE
                            APPROPRIATIONS FOR AREAS OF INTEREST TO THEM. AMOUNTS INVOLVED ARE STILL
                            RELATIVELY SMALL, BUT CONTINUED SYSTEMATIC OVERRIDING OF ACABQ WILL
                            REMOVE LAST BARRIER TO EVENTUAL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN UN MAJORITY AND
                            ITS MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. (TEN MEMBER STATES CONTRIBUTE 77 PERCENT OF UN
                            BUDGET.)</p>
                        <p>5. NONALIGNED POSITION ON THE UN BUDGET, PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS, LAW OF
                            THE SEA, AND NUMEROUS OTHER QUESTIONS ARE CLEARLY RELATED TO THEIR
                            PRIORITY CONCERNS WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND "LIBERATION" OF
                            SOUTHERN AFRICA AND ISRAELI OCCUPIED TERRITORY. MORE DIFFICULT TO
                            UNDERSTAND HAS BEEN THE NONALIGNED POSITIONS ON SUCH PERIPHERAL
                            QUESTIONS AS KOREA, CAMBODIA, AND VIETNAM, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE
                            FACT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE MOVEMENT CLOSEST TO THE SCENE ARE IN
                            GENERAL THE LEST DESIROUS OF CONCERTED NONALIGNED ACTION. NONALIGNED
                            POSITION ON THESE QUESTIONS SEEMS TO BE COMBINATION OF EMOTIONAL
                            RESPONSE TO SITUATION THEY SEE AS ANALOGOUS TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AND A
                            PRACTICAL DESIRE TO EXCHANGE THEIR VOTES ON ISSUES NOT OF ESSENTIAL
                            INTEREST TO THEM FOR COMMUNIST SUPPORT ON ITEMS OF REAL CONCERN.</p>
                        <p>6. AFRICAN GROUP, COMPRISING ALMOST ONE-THIRD OF UN MEMBERSHIP, DOMINATE
                            THE NONALIGNED NUMERICALLY. DURING THIS GA SESSION, ALLIANCE OF AFRICANS
                            AND ARABS HAS BECOME MORE SOLID; ARAB DELEGATES ARE GOING OUT OF WAY TO
                            SUPPORT FULLY AFRICAN POSITIONS ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN QUESTIONS, IN RETURN
                            FOR ALMOST TOTAL AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR ARAB CAUSE IN MIDDLE EAST. AFRICANS
                            AND ARABS, IN TURN, ARE MAKING STRONG EFFORTS TO WIN INCREASING SUPPORT
                            FROM ASIANS AND LATIN AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN
                            NONALIGNED CONFERENCE. THEY SEEM TO BE ENJOYING INITIAL SUCCESS.</p>
                        <p>7. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPING SOLIDARITY THIS GA SESSION WAS
                            OBVIOUSLY THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE AT ALGIERS, HELD JUST PRIOR TO GA
                            OPENING AND CLEARLY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE JUST THIS KIND OF UNITY AT UN.
                            ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN, WE ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF
                            IMPORTANCE OF "RESOLUTIONS" ADOPTED AT ALGIERS. ON KOREAN ISSUE, FOR
                            EXAMPLE, WE RAN INTO GREAT RELUCTANCE, EVEN AMONG SOUTH KOREA'S FRIENDS,
                            TO TAKE POSITIONS CONTRARY TO ALGIERS' "DECISION". A TUNISIAN DELEGATE
                            UNABASHEDLY ASSERTED THAT NONALIGNED STATE COULD VOTE CONTRARY TO
                            ALGIERS' RESOLUTION, BUT COULD AT THE MOST ABSTAIN. WE WITNESSED
                            RECENTLY AN INTERESTING ENCOUNTER IN FIFTH COMMITTEE IN WHICH MAURITIAN
                            AMB (ALSO AFRICAN GROUP LEADER), WAS IMMEDIATELY AND PUBLICLY CALLED TO
                            ORDER BY ALGERIANS FOR TAKING LINE CONTRARY TO NONALIGNED POSITION. AMB
                            RESISTED, BUT FINALLY RECANTED AND CHANGED HIS POSITION.</p>
                        <p>8. THERE ARE STILL CENTRIFUGAL FORCES AT WORK, EVEN AMONG AFRICANS
                            THEMSELVES, AND FISSURES STILL APPEAR EVEN ON AFRICAN ISSUES. RECENT
                            EXAMPLE WAS OPEN SPLIT AMONG AFRICAN GROUP IN FOURTH COMMITTEE VOTE ON
                            PORTUGUESE TERRITORIES RESOLUTIONS. BASIS OF SPLIT SEEMED TO BE EFFORT
                            OF SOME NONALIGNED, LED BY TANZANIA, TO COME UP WITH TEXT THAT WOULD
                            ATTRACT EVEN WIDER SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY AMONG EUROPEANS. THE MAVERICK
                            LIBYAN DELEGATION RESISTED, HOWEVER, AND INTRODUCED AN AMENDMENT IN
                            EFFECT OPENLY SANCTIONING USE OF FORCE BY LIBERATION ORGANIZATIONS. THIS
                            PRECIPITATED OPEN FIGHT ON FLOOR AMONG AFRICANS, NO LESS BITTER FOR FACT
                            THAT AFRICAN SPEAKERS DEPLORED SHOW OF DISUNITY. COHESION OF NONALIGNED
                            IS NOT YET FULLY TESTED ON ISSUES WHICH MAY INVOLVE DIVERGENT NATIONAL
                            INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUAL NONALIGNED STATES. A TEST IN THE UN CONTEXT MAY
                            COME LATER ON ISSUES LIKE LAW OF THE SEA. THE MOST WE CAN SAY AT PRESENT
                            IS THAT REFLEX FOR UNITY IS STRONG AND PEER PRESSURE IS HIGHLY
                            PERSUASIVE.</p>
                        <p>9. ALGERIAN DELEGATION IS DRIVEN TO ASSERT LEADERSHIP OVER NONALIGNED AND

                                >NAC</gloss>, IS ACTIVE PROMOTING UNITY AND IS ADEPT AT USING

                            IN AN EVEN STRONGER POSITION TO EXERCISE LEADERSHIP ROLE. SOME AFRICANS
                            HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT ALGERIAN STRONG ARM TACTICS IN RAMMING THROUGH
                            RESOLUTIONS AT NAC, AND ABOUT DIFFICULTIES THEY EXPERIENCED EVEN
                            REGISTERING THEIR "RESERVATIONS" TO CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS WITH ALGERIAN
                            FOREIGN MINISTRY. FRIENDLY ASIAN DELEGATIONS HAVE NOTED PRIVATELY THEIR
                            FORMAL RESERVATIONS AT ALGIERS NAC MEETING ON ASINA ISSUES SUCH AS
                            SUPPORT OF BRUNK, <gloss target="#t_PRGSV1">PRG</gloss>, ETC. SINGAPORE
                            IN FACT REPORTEDLY PUT A GENERAL RESERVATION ON THE RECORD AT ALGIERS.
                            NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND UNWILLINGNESS TO OPPOSE NUMERICALLY OVERWHELMING
                            AFRO-ARAB BLOCK HAVE MEANT THAT ASIAN OBJECTIONS HERE TO NAC-SPONSORED
                            RESOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN COMPARATIVELY LOW-KEY FASHION THEREBY
                            AVOIDING, SO FAR, HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER
                            THE MORE MODERATE AMONG THE NONALIGNED WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW
                            HARD-LINE, ALGERIAN-STYLE LEADERSHIP.</p>
                        <p>10. NONALIGNED STATES CLEARLY SENSE POWER THEY CAN WIELD, AND NOW THERE
                            IS A DISTURBING TENDENCY TO USE THIS POWER ON INCREASING NUMBER OF
                            ISSUES. MOST STRIKING RECENT DEVELOPMENT WAS INTRODUCTION BY AFRICAN
                            GROUP IN SIXTH COMMITTEE OF A PARTICULARLY MISCHIEVOUS AMENDMENT TO
                            CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS. AFRICAN AMENDMENT WOULD EXEMPT
                            NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS FROM PROVISIONS OF CONVENTION; THIS WOULD
                            IN EFFECT SABOTAGE ENTIRE EFFORT. (FOR EXAMPLE, KHARTOUM MURDERS WOULD
                            NOT BE COVERED BY SUCH A CONVENTION) DANGER OF THIS TREND IS THAT
                            NONALIGNED MAY COME TO LOOK AT ALL ISSUES, EVEN MOST UNCONTENTIOUS,
                            SOLELY IN THE LIGHT OF HOW THEY MAY EFFECT PROGRESS TOWARDS CENTRAL
                            NONALIGNED GOALS.</p>
                        <p>11. SO FAR, NONALIGNED UNITY HAS WORKED TO BENEFIT OF SOVIET BLOC, SINCE
                            SOVIETS ARE IN POSITION TO SUPPORT AFRICANS ON AFRICAN ISSUES AND ARABS
                            ON MIDDLE EASTERN ONES AND OFTEN GO AT IT WITH STOMACH-TURNING
                            OBSEQUIOUSNESS IT IS BY NO MEANS INEVITABLE THAT SOVIETS WILL ALWAYS
                            BENEFIT. ON ISSUES LIKE PROTECTION OF DIPLOMATS AND DEVELOPMENT THE US
                            AND <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> MAY WELL FIND THEMSELVES
                            TOGETHER IN SMALL MINORITY. CHINA, ON OTHER HAND, IS IN A POSITION TO
                            GAIN MOST MILEAGE FROM INCREASED COHESION AND POWER OF NON-ALIGNED. SOME
                            NON-ALIGNED STATES TEND TO REGARD CHINA AS ONE OF THEM, AND CHINESE
                            DELEGATION HERE HAS CAREFULLY NURTURED AND EXPLOITED THIS ADVANTAGE.
                            UNFORTUNATELY THOSE NATIONS WHO HAVE THE MOST REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS OF
                            CHINESE INFLUENCE AND THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH IT ARE JUST
                            THOSE WHOSE INFLUENCE WITHIN THE NON-ALIGNED IS ON THE WANE.</p>
                        <p>11. VARIOUS AFRICAN DELEGATIONS, FRIENDLY TO US, HAVE TOLD US THAT
                            NON-ALIGNED GROUP IS WATCHING US VOTES ON AFRICAN ISSUES VERY CAREFULLY.
                            (SEE <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">SEPTEL</gloss> FOR AFRICAN REACTIONS TO
                            OUR VOTES OF PORTUGUESE TERRITORIES.) GHANAIAN AMB TOLD US FRANKLY THAT
                            AFRICANS ARE ENGAGED IN "VOTE TRADING." (USUN 4575) THIS PROBABLY
                            FORESHADOWS AN INCREASED TENDENCY TO VOTE AGAINST US, SOLELY AS RESPONSE
                            TO OUR NEGATIVE VOTES ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN OR OTHER ISSUES OF INTEREST TO
                            THE NON-ALIGNED.</p>
                        <p>12. COMMENT: ON EACH OF THE ISSUES OF CENTRAL CONCERN TO THE NON-ALIGNED
                            (DEVELOPMENT, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA), THE US IS SEEN AS A
                            PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO UN ACTION OF THE SORT THEY SUPPORT. IF THE US IS
                            NOT TO BE FURTHER ISOLATED WITHIN THE UN AND IF THE UN IS NOT EVENTUALLY
                            TO BE DESTROYED AS AN INSTITUTION FOR CONSTRUCTIVE INTERNATIONAL
                            COOPERATION, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ON THESE ITEMS TO
                            CONVINCE THE MORE REASONABLE NON-ALIGNED THAT THE GRADUALIST APPROACH
                            URGED BY THE US HAS SOME CHANCE OF MEETING THEIR ASPIRATIONS. AT THE
                            SAME TIME THE US MUST MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CAN ONLY BE PUSHED SO FAR, AND
                            THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE SUCH INSTRUMENTS AS THE VETO AND THE POWER
                            OF TH PURSE TO BLOCK IRRESPONSIBLE AND HARMFUL UN ACTION, REGARDLESS OF
                            THE NUMERICAL MAJORITY BEHIND IT. <lb/>

                                >GA</gloss> WHICH RECESSED DECEMBER 18 WAS BETTER THAN WE HAD
                            EXPECTED, WITH SUPPORT OF OUR DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS CONTRIBUTING GREATLY
                            TO SUCCESS IN SEVERAL CRITICAL SITUATIONS. INITIATIVES IN SECRETARY'S GA
                            ADDRESS HAD POSITIVE IMPACT. WE WERE ABLE TO ATTAIN OBJECTIVES ON
                            SEVERAL IMPORTANT POLITICAL ITEMS, WHILE REMAINING IN SMALL MINORITY ON
                            MOST AFRICAN AND ISRAELI RELATED ISSUES. IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AREAS US
                            JOINED IN CONSENSUS WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON NUMBER OF IMPORTANT
                            RESOLUTIONS IN CONTRAST WITH RELATIVE ISOLATION IN 1972. WE ALSO MADE
                            MODEST GAINS IN HUMAN RIGHTS AREA AND IN URGING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.
                            HOWEVER, GROWING AFRO-ARAB COHESION AND MILITANCY IN PURSUING OBJECTIVES
                            OFTEN CONTRARY TO OUR INTERESTS WILL MAKE DEFENSE OF US POSITIONS AND

                            EVEN MORE DIFFICULT NEXT YEAR. ACTION REQUESTED: REVIEW WITH HOST

                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. GENERAL ASSESSMENT: WE ARE REASONABLY PLEASED WITH OVERALL GA RESULTS.
                            THERE WERE SOME SUCCESSES IN ALL FIELDS. WHERE SETBACKS OCCURRED, THEY
                            WERE CONTAINED. POLEMICS WERE KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS,
                            SUCH AS <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ON MIDDLE EAST, AND <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> ON CAMBODIA AND AGAINST USSR ON
                            DISARMAMENT. OUR SATISFACTION, HOWEVER, IS TEMPERED BY REALIZATION THAT
                            PROSPECTS FOR NEXT YEAR'S GA LESS THAN PROMISING.</p>
                        <p>3. 28TH GA DEMONSTRATED INCREASING TENDENCY OF <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'S TO PREOCCUPY UN WITH THEIR PRIORITIES AND TO GAIN UN
                            ENDORSEMENT OF POLITICAL POSITIONS ESTABLISHED IN NON-ALIGNED AND <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> FORUMS. TO SOME EXTENT THIS STEMS FROM
                            FRUSTRATION THAT IMPORTANT WORLD PROBLEMS ARE LARGELY DEALT WITH OUTSIDE
                            UN. IN MAIN, HOWEVER, MILITANT GROUP OF "NONALIGNEDS" ARE SEEKING TO
                            CAPITALIZE ON THEIR PARLIAMENTARY VOTING POWER TO MAKE GA SERVE THEIR
                            PURPOSES.</p>
                        <p>4. US POSITION ON POLITICAL ISSUES WAS INCREASINGLY DEFENSIVE. WE SOUGHT
                            BY FINESSING CONFRONTATIONS AND REDUCING UN ROLE IN ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE
                            TO REDUCE OUR VULNERABILITY IN DEBATE, E.G., ON KOREA. OTHERWISE WE
                            STROVE TO ANTICIPATE AND MANEUVER TO LIMIT THE DAMAGE, E.G., ON KHMER
                            CREDENTIALS, MIDDLE EAST, AND DISARMAMENT. ON ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT
                            ISSUES, WE NEGOTIATED RESOLUTIONS THAT LEAVE BASIC DECISIONS TO <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            AND OTHER FORA WHERE ECONOMIC REALITIES RECEIVE GREATER WEIGHT.</p>
                        <p>5. OUR TASK WAS COMPLICATED BY GROWING AFRO-ARAB MILITANT DOMINATION OF
                            NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND BY FREQUENT UNWILLINGNESS OR INABILITY OF
                            MODERATES TO RESIST PRESSURE FOR GROUP SOLIDARITY. VOTES OR POSITIONS
                            WERE OFTEN JUSTIFIED BY REFERENCES TO NON-ALIGNED CONFERENCE (<gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_Reses1"
                                >RESES</gloss> EVEN WHEN SUBJECTS HAD NOT BEEN FULLY DEBATED OR
                            ENDORSED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS AND WERE FAR REMOVED FROM DIRECT INTEREST
                            OF COUNTRIES CONCERNED (E.G., NAC RESES ON KOREA, CAMBODIA, PUERTO
                            RICO).</p>
                        <p>6. NONETHELESS OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN TO AVOID AUTOMATIC APPLICATION OF
                            NON-ALIGNED VOTING MAJORITY BY SPLITTING OFF MODERATE NON-ALIGNED FROM
                            MILITANTS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS: (A) ADOPTING POSITION ON "MIDDLE
                            GROUND" OR WHICH OTHERWISE DEEMED EQUITABLE OR REASONABLE (E.G.,
                            DEFERMENT OF KHMER REPRESENTATION ITEM; <gloss target="#t_UNEF1"
                                >UNEF</gloss> FINANCING FORMULA); (B) WORKING WITH SELECTED
                            AFRO-ASIAN REGIONALS (E.G., SE ASIAN EFFORTS IN KHMER CREDENTIALS) AND
                            OTHERWISE CONVINCING NON-ALIGNED THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ARE IN THEIR
                            OWN INTEREST (SUCCESSFULLY IN CASE OF CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF
                            DIPLOMATS); AND (C) ENCOURAGING RECOGNITION THAT SUCCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
                            PROGRAM DEPENDS ON CONTINUING COOPERATION OF DONOR COUNTRIES. AT SAME
                            TIME, EXIGENCIES OF US WORLD-WIDE INTERESTS AND COMMITMENTS USUALLY
                            INHIBIT US FROM EFFECTIVE LOG-ROLLING. MOREOVER OUR INCREASED
                            IDENTIFICATION WITH ISRAEL AND PORTUGAL IN CONNECTION MIDDLE EAST WAR
                            AND USE OF AZORES FURTHER REDUCED OUR ALREADY SLIM MARGIN OF MANEUVER
                            WITH AFRICAN AND ARAB UN DELEGATIONS.</p>
                        <p>7. WE MUST EXPECT THAT AT 29TH GA NON-ALIGNED MILITANTS, AWARE OF THEIR
                            VOTING COHESION AND STRENGTH, IN CONTROL OF ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES, AND
                            PROBABLY WITH ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >BOUTEFLIKA</persName> IN THE PRESIDENCY, WILL PRESS EVEN MORE
                            ENERGETICALLY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THEM SUCH AS COLONIALISM, RACE
                            DISCRIMINATION, SOVEREIGNTY OVER NATURAL RESOURCES, AND PREFERENTIAL
                            TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT MEASURES. EVEN WHEN WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR
                            OBJECTIVES, WE MUST OPPOSE METHODS SUCH AS APPLICATION OF UNREALISTIC
                            SANCTIONS OR USE OF UN AND ITS RESOURCES TO AID INSURGENT GROUPS.</p>
                        <p>8. THUS, OVERALL PROBLEM FOR US THROUGH NEXT YEAR WILL BE HOW TO COPE
                            WITH OUR NEAR-ISOLATION ON POLITICAL ISSUES OF OVERRIDING INTEREST TO A

                            OR OBSTACLE FOR THE US?</p>
                        <p>The third world is remembered only when it tiresomely succumbs to famine
                            or massacre, or when it behaves obstreperously in the United Nations....
                            <lb/>Charles Yost in an editorial in the Christian Science Monitor,
                            August 20, 1973</p>
                        <p>The non-aligned members of the UN have become a potent force in UN
                            affairs, and the frequent anti-Western positions of this group are of
                            growing concern to US policymakers. This paper examines the structure,
                            nature, and role of the non-aligned states, with particular emphasis on
                            the group's cohesion within and outside the UN.</p>
                        <p>ABSTRACT </p>
                        <p>The growing collective assertiveness of the majority of poorer, weaker,
                            and very often smaller UN members is partly a reflection of their
                            increasing resentment at having their vital concerns disregarded by the
                            big powers. It also is a recognition on their part that numerically
                            speaking, i.e., in terms of UN votes, they can exercise considerable
                            leverage on political and economic issues of concern to them. Deeply
                            ingrained feelings about having been wronged, combined with a sharply
                            honed sense of practical politics, thus have contributed to the
                            emergence at the UN of a group of non-aligned states which embraces most
                            of the existing African, Arab, and Asian members and about half of the
                            Latin American nations. These two factors also have served to reduce
                            inherent divisions in this highly disparate group and to help concert
                            the actions of member-states on many issues which impinge on the
                            concerns of the big powers and the other industrialized nations. As a
                            result, the nonaligned states have become a factor to be reckoned with
                            increasingly when the UN, or one of its specialized agencies, takes up
                            such issues as the environment, the law of the sea, terrorism, economic
                            issues, disarmament, or the Middle East crisis.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the non-aligned group still is subject to internal
                            strains and stresses, partly because of tensions between an Afro-Arab
                            majority, led by a radical few, and a moderate Asian minority, and
                            partly because of an incipient struggle for leadership of the group,
                            presently held by the Algerians. </p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, non-aligned activity in the current UN session, while far
                            from exhibiting solidarity, has shown greater cohesion than ever before.
                            This situation probably is due to the successful trade-offs which the
                            Afro-Arab majority achieved in supporting each other in their campaigns
                            against the white regimes of southern Africa and Israel, as well as the
                            fact that the Asian minority and other moderates have been concerned
                            about being isolated and have tended, therefore, to mute their
                            unresolved differences with the more militant majority.</p>
                        <p>While many non-aligned initiatives have a distinctly anti-Western, that
                            is, anti-US, thrust, the group also has sometimes directed its barbs
                            against the Soviets, and on occasion against the Chinese. In this
                            context, it is well to note the extent to which the non-aligned have
                            learned to play upon Soviet ideological proclivities, a development
                            discomfiting to the Soviets from which they find it difficult to
                            dissociate themselves. Before long, Peking, which continues to align
                            itself with the most radical non-aligned element, may confront the same
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>For the US, the activities of the non-aligned members of the UN have
                            become an increasingly troublesome problem as they look upon this
                            country as the principal obstacle to the type of UN action they seek in
                            a number of areas, notably in the Middle East and southern Africa and in
                            economic development. In this context, the US often finds itself also
                            isolated as Western Europeans and Latin Americans, particularly the
                            former, have shown a growing reluctance to stand up against the
                            non-aligned. At the same time, this is not a case of undifferentiated
                            hostility toward this country. On numerous occasions, the funding for
                            the UN Emergency Force, reallocation of contributions to the UN budget,
                            the fight over the Khmer Republic's credentials--to cite just a few
                            cases, the non-aligned not only have been divided themselves but also
                            many of them voted with the US.</p>
                        <p>There is thus not yet a built-in majority against this country in the UN.
                            Besides, the character of non-aligned solidarity is not unassailable.
                            But in overcoming it, the US has had to expend an enormous amount of
                            energy as well as political capital, which raises some questions about
                            the vulnerability of this country to increasing pressure on issues of
                            possibly vital importance to it. The fact remains that the interests of
                            the non-aligned in the Middle East, the racial question in South Africa,
                            and general economic development tend to place the US in opposition to
                            them. The cumulative effect of such confrontations raises the specter of
                            growing US isolation in the UN unless enough progress is made on these
                            issues to satisfy the needs of an increasing number among the
                            non-aligned.</p>

                            list</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Win, are you in charge? </p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>I thought we could concentrate this morning on the three
                            Fs: food, fertilizer and funding schemes. Of these, the most promising
                            is food, for humanitarian reasons and as an example for others,
                            particularly the oil producers.</p>
                        <p>After our discussion today, we should get a game plan ready for your
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Two major questions on food are whether we follow the Humphrey approach
                            or a unilateral one, and whether we go for a big initiative or for an
                            incremental approach.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We will get to food in a minute. I made six points in
                            my UN speech. This is only one of them. Where are the other five?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>They are covered in this package, but we felt that to focus
                            our energies it would be better to consider this topic now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Can I get a paper on what is being done in each
                            area?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>You have them, attached to the package.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>OK, Now, on food: if I understand the problem
                            correctly, we have to choose between an incremental or a sweeping
                            approach, and then decide when to announce it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>In addition, we must decide whether to go the Humphrey
                            route, which would require agreement with others, or a more unilateral
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Ken, what is your view? </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW1">Rush</persName>
                            <lb/>To obtain the maximum impact, I would favor the big program over
                            the incremental approach. As to timing, I would wait until we know
                            better what our crop situation will be. As to the Humphrey proposal, I
                            would certainly want to find out if others are willing to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEW2">Martin</persName>
                            <lb/>I agree on the basic approach, though I would wait until the crop
                            starts coming in, so that we can ensure our actions would have the least
                            impact on domestic prices. As to how to do it, I would do it
                            unilaterally, but consult.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Does this mean waiting until July? </p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin <lb/>Yes. But we might consider making a statement of intent
                            before the end of the Special UN General Assembly. There is a great deal
                            of interest. You should know for example, that Barbara Ward called me
                            last night about PL-480.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName>
                            <lb/>We do not have nearly that much time before we must disclose our
                            approach. Tuesday we will be facing the Algerians, and they are
                            hardlining us. We must either fish or cut bait. The UN meeting will
                            either have succeeded or failed before July. We have an opportunity to
                            state our approach, perhaps put a price tag on it and look constructive.
                            The alternative is a deadlock, with the Iranians complaining that no one
                            backed up their offer of providing $150 million to a Special Fund.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>The purpose of this meeting is not to discuss next
                            week's tactics. I thought we were going to discuss our long-term
                            follow-on. Why don't we support the Special Fund? Is there nothing we
                            can put in?</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>No</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Well, what do we have in mind when we talk of helping
                            the less developed?</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>Nothing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Parker <lb/>Except for our bilateral aid program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ETO1">Enders</persName>
                            <lb/>We do not have to take a negative stance. We can use other means
                            and find a way of having our bilateral programs considered.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BWB1">Buffum</persName>
                            <lb/>We could establish a special accounting program under the Economic
                            and Social Council that would have everything taken into account. That
                            way, cash could be counted (the Saudi and the Iranian contributions),
                            and we would be able to have food and fertilizer contributions in our
                            on-going programs counted also.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>Good. That shifts the emphasis from money to programs. We
                            could even use a price tag of $4 billion. That would make us look
                            good.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>How is that $4 billion figure arrived at? The issue is
                            not so much how we get through the UN Special Session, but rather how we
                            deal with the basic problems.</p>
                        <p>Rebudgeting is not responsive to the necessities I defined in my speech.
                            Rebudgeting may help us to get through the session. We must do more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin <lb/>There is some additionality here--PL-480. We can also
                            count additional funds for agriculture under our aid program.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>But that is already budgeted. </p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>There is no way to escape going to Congress for the
                            Special Fund.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>There are two problems here. First, we can package
                            better what we already have. And that is something. It is certainly more
                            than others have. Secondly, however, if my speech is to contribute to
                            more than the editorial page of the New York Times, it must make a
                            contribution that would not have happened without the speech. This we
                            can't do by next week. We must consider each of the six areas of my
                            speech and find what can be done to implement them.</p>
                        <p>I am impressed by the argument that something must be done for the less
                            developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>That is why we urged that we should develop a scenario for
                            food. This requires coordination and the development of a strategy for
                            dealing with Congress and <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName>:
                            Secondly, we can focus on the fertilizer initiative. Thirdly, there is
                            the problem of funding, and how to deal with schemes like Iranian
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>How about the raw materials survey?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lorad <lb/>There is a paper on that. We are consulting with other
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>The dominant theme at the UN is how to help those most
                            affected by the extra costs induced by the oil situation. That is the
                            beauty of the Iranian proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>But that doesn't help in other areas.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>True. That is what we need programs for. But we should
                            have some concessional element.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>We can make clear the world should orchestrate on the basis
                            of each country's concentrating on its areas of greatest strength. We
                            can move on food. Others can contribute in other areas.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>There are several elements involved here. First, what
                            each can do unilaterally. Secondly, how we can move to a more rational
                            global set of relations on raw materials. Thirdly, the development of a
                            general trade and investment strategy.</p>
                        <p>As concerns next week, the bookkeeping approach is the best we can do,
                            but we must develop a longer-range strategy.</p>
                        <p>Can somebody tell the Secretary General that we are taking a positive
                            attitude toward the Special Fund?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            <lb/>I told <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName> that last
                            night. Now it's up to Scali... </p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Now on food…</p>
                        <p>Mr. Donaldson <lb/>I agree with Ed Martin, though I suspect the timing is
                            more a matter of three to four months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>We can move ahead earlier by working through our
                            estimates. Butz feels the new crop is virtually assured now. We should
                            be able to have this worked out in two months. By the end of June.
                            <lb/>(Several "yes" statements around the table) </p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>That would be good timing also for the July preparatory
                            meeting for the World Food Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>I am not worried about any individual Cabinet member
                            if we know what we want. This government does not operate by consensus.
                            The question is to determine what is right and what we want.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Martin <lb/>When you get back we can have a position prepared that is
                            further developed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>In general, I favor a comprehensive approach rather
                            than an incremental one. We should move unilaterally, making sure that
                            we build in participatory opportunities for others who may wish to join
                            us. The program should, therefore, be one that can later be folded into
                            a multilateral approach. But it should not be subject to veto by others.
                            It is better to take a big bite than a little one.</p>
                        <p>But having said this, I don't know what the specific details should be.
                            You should look at this in terms of what is right, not in terms of what
                            is bureaucratically possible. Then I can work it out with Butz or with
                            the President.</p>
                        <p>What about trade and investment? </p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>We are working on that. We need a new look at our
                            commodities policy. It has not been looked at in ten years, and is a
                            most difficult and controversial issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>And the review ten years ago probably led to a
                            reassertion of prior policy. You are working on this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>Yes. But we need outside assistance. I would like to have
                            Tony Solomon work with people in the Bureau for one month to develop a
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>I don't see anyone missing from the 28 layers that
                            surround me in the Department. Can we agree to go ahead on this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>On fertilizer...</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>On fertilizer, we should go ahead on a national
                            program, in advance of the International Fertilizer Institute, folding
                            it in later.</p>
                        <p>On energy, we will have another crisis in a year or two. We must use the
                            interval to prepare. Are we working on this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Donaldson <lb/>Yes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>And let's see if we can pick one project where someone
                            does something for us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>The contribution of others is built into the sharing
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Donaldson <lb/>Right. That is part of the package. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We must also do something about conservation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>On investment, there are various proposals for funds
                            financed by oil money. These proposals also will be stillborn unless
                            mechanisms are developed to take advantage of them. One possibility is
                            the Witteven proposal for an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            facility and we should pursue that. Another would be a new Development
                            Council, perhaps working with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            with weighted voting, and with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>
                            representation. The response of the world community is weakest on the
                            financial end. No one wants to finance Arab price gouging.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>We need a decision on supporting the Special Fund. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We will support it so long as we can count our
                            contributions in other than cash.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Enders <lb/>We are not giving to that fund.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>What if the discussion...</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We cannot be charged twice for the acts of others.
                            First in the dislocation of our own economy and then second in
                            contributing to others. Our position is we are willing to work toward a
                            cooperative international structure that will mitigate, if not prevent,
                            further occurrences of this kind. But we are not going to get caught in
                            emergency measures to alleviate the effects of the irresponsibility of
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Scali <lb/>What if we can't shift from the fund to the program? </p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We will participate in the program in commodities. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>In the joint commissions with the Arabs, we can emphasize
                            fertilizer programs.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>What I need is a comprehensive program that all can be
                            working on. We must develop a comprehensive strategy that will encompass
                            these bilateral deals.</p>
                        <p>Who will do it? Who will develop a strategy that goes beyond next
                            week?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lord <lb/>We must all do it, together. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Now, Jack, what about the <gloss target="#t_OAS1"
                                >OAS</gloss>? </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJB1">Kubisch</persName>
                            <lb/>There are 14 major initiatives coming out of the OAS and Foreign
                            Ministers meetings. These proposals have been treated only in a
                            preliminary way in the papers. The proposals need to be refined into a
                            plan of action that will carry us through this year.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>Are you going to get these two working groups
                            going?</p>
                        <p> Mr. Kubisch <lb/>Brazil will host the one on science and technology.
                            Mexico supports this. On the one on transnational corporations, there is
                            no consensus yet. We are a strong possibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>I am in favor of that. We are going to get kicked
                            around anyway. We might as well chair the group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kubisch <lb/>Costa Rica is the other possibility, but we have
                            reservations...</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>What kind of staff work would we get out of Costa
                            Rica? If Brazil wanted it, I would be delighted. But if others do not
                            object to our doing it, let's do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kubisch <lb/>We will take some soundings. If we can get two or three
                            of the major Latin countries lined up (on our hosting the group), we'll
                            just call a meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>In each category of our general strategy, I want to
                            see what a special position for Latin America would look like. It makes
                            no sense talking of a "special relationship" if there is no special
                            relationship. I know some of you don't agree, but we ought to do it. And
                            I think in food and in science and technology we can do it. I want to
                            make very sure that we make a very major contribution in science and
                            technology.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kubisch <lb/>We have a proposal, here in the package.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary <lb/>We (to the assemblage) should meet again. You, Win
                            (Mr. Lord), should have a program ready when I return.</p>

                            AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, EXPOSING STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, WITH OIL
                            EMBARGO AND RELATED PRICE INCREASES PROVIDING FOCUS OF BEHIND SCENES
                            DISCORD WHEN NATIONAL INTERESTS DIFFERENTIALLY AND SERIOUSLY
                            AFFECTED.</p>
                        <p>3. US POSTURE: <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> GENERALLY HAS SO FAR
                            PURPOSELY DISPLAYED RELATIVELY LOW-KEY INTEREST IN NACG ACTIVITIES.
                            HOWEVER, DEVELOPMENTS IN 28TH UNGA AND SIXTH SPECIAL SESSION LEAD US TO
                            CONSIDER WHETHER OUR DEFENSIVE LOW PROFILE APPROACH TO NON-ALIGNEDS MAY
                            NOT BE INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE. PROSPECTS ARE: (A) NACG METHOD OF
                            HANDLING POLITICAL ISSUES EXTENDED TO ECONOMIC AND TRADE AREA AS IN
                            ALGERIAN INITIATIVE FOR SPECIAL SESSION, COULD AFFECT INCREASINGLY AND
                            ADVERSELY US ECONOMIC AS WELL AS POLITICAL INTERESTS; (B) INTERNATIONAL
                            ORGANIZATIONS DOMINATED BY NON-ALIGNED SLOGANS AND PRIORITIES COULD BE
                            SEEN BY AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS AS MEANINGLESS OR HOSTILE FORUMS;
                            (C) US COULD BE ISOLATED INCREASINGLY AS APPARENT PROTECTOR OF STATUS
                            QUO ON NACG-AGITATED ISSUES CONCERNING SELF-DETERMINATION, RACIAL
                            EQUALITY, AND DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL RESOURCES; (D) DISCERNIBLE TREND
                            AMONG DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO DRAW AWAY FROM US ON SUCH ISSUES COULD
                            STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS; AND (E) NACG BLOC VOTING CARRIED TO EXTREME COULD
                            SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE UN AS A DELIBERATIVE BODY. WHILE USG HAS NOT WISHED
                            TO APPEAR TO BE USING DIVIDE AND RULE TACTICS, WE DO HAVE STAKE IN
                            HAVING LDCS RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES OF INTEREST AMONG THEMSELVES AND DEAL
                            PRACTICALLY WITHIN UN SYSTEM WITH PROBLEMS WHICH VITALLY AFFECT THEM.
                            ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE INTERESTED IN ACCURATE PICTURE OF SIGNIFICANT
                            DIVERGENCES AMONG LDCS AS THEY EMERGE. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO
                            TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SITUATION TO ENCOURAGE MORE PRAGMATIC LDC APPROACHES
                            TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES, AND THEREBY TO CONTRIBUTE TO MORE
                            REALISTIC PERFORMANCE OF UN BODIES, ESPECIALLY <gloss target="#t_GA1"

                        <p>4. US MEANS FOR IMPROVING ATMOSPHERE IN US-LDC RELATIONS AND FOR
                            ENCOURAGING LDCS TOWARD MORE INDEPENDENT AND CONSTRUCTIVE STANDS ARE
                            LIMITED. CONTRADICTIONS OR DIFFERENCES IN DEGREE BETWEEN (A) NATIONAL
                            LDC POLICIES ON BILATERAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL AND (B) THOSE PURSUED IN
                            MULTILATERAL CONTEXT ARE NOT UNCOMMON. HOWEVER, OUR RESOURCES AND
                            OPPORTUNITIES CAN BE BETTER USED THAN AT PRESENT NOT ONLY TO PROMOTE
                            MORE FAVORABLE VOTING PATTERNS IN UN ET AL, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO
                            ENCOURAGE: GREATER LDC READINESS TO WORK WITH US PRAGMATICALLY, LESS
                            DISPOSITION TO COMPLICATE OUR SECURITY PROBLEMS, MORE INCLINATION TO
                            ESCHEW CONFRONTATION AND TO LIMIT HORTATORY RESOLUTIONS TO POLITICALLY
                            ESSENTIAL AREAS, ETC. APPROPRIATE MEANS MIGHT INCLUDE: </p>
                        <p>A) ENCOURAGE AWARENESS OF NATIONAL INTEREST OF LDCS IN STABLE
                            INTERDEPENDENT WORLD ECONOMY AND EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

                        <p>B) CONSULT MORE FULLY ON MULTILATERAL ISSUES IN CAPITALS, WASHINGTON, AND

                            INITIATIVES (E.G., WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE), WHICH CAN BE IMPLEMENTED

                            CONSIDERATIONS, OUR WILLINGNESS TO USE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD
                            BE AFFECTED BY THEIR OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS WHICH, IN TURN, DEPENDS
                            TO SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON INCREASED LDC UNDERSTANDING OF, AND

                        <p>5. BACKGROUND: NACG AND G-77 INCLUDE MOST LDCS WITH IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS.
                            THESE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY SHARE ECONOMIC GOALS, BUT OCCASIONALLY
                            DIFFER IN TACTICS, LEADERSHIP, AND POLITICAL COMMITMENTS. NON-ALIGNED
                            MOVEMENT (ABOUT 80 COUNTRIES), BEGINNING WITH GENERAL LDC DESIRE TO
                            AVOID POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT IN BIG POWER RIVALRIES, SOON BECAME WAY TO
                            ACHIEVE SAFETY IN NUMBERS ON WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES EXPRESSED MOST
                            POTENTLY IN VOTING MAJORITIES IN UN AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

                            POSITIONS. THESE INCLUDE ISSUES OF LITTLE DIRECT INTEREST TO MOST NACG
                            MEMBERSHIP (E.G., KOREA, VIETNAM, <gloss target="#t_GRUNK1"

                            MODERATES WERE INEFFECTIVE AND, ALTHOUGH PRIVATELY CRITICAL OF
                            MILITANTS, DID LITTLE TO DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM RESULT. IN 28TH

                            HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND US POINT OF VIEW AND AT LEAST TAKE
                            NEUTRAL STANCE, WERE UNWILLING TO CONSIDER ISSUES ON MERITS AND WOULD
                            NOT DEPART FROM POSITION ADOPTED AT PREPARATORY NACG MEETINGS. PROBLEM
                            EXTENDED WELL BEYOND TRADITIONAL DIFFICULTIES WITH NON-ALIGNED AND

                            OCCASIONALLY HAS BEEN STRIDENT, BUT G-77 USUALLY PLAYS DOWN POLITICAL
                            POSTURING AND CONFRONTATION, AND NUMEROUS CONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMIC STEPS
                            HAVE BEEN TAKEN AT UN ON CONSENSUS BASIS, E.G., 2ND DEVELOPMENT DECADE

                        <p>2. AS POSTS AWARE, WE HAVE LONG BEEN TROUBLED AT TENDENCY OF MANY LDC'S
                            AND SOMETIMES OTHERS TO PUSH THROUGH RESOLUTIONS WITHOUT ADEQUATE
                            CONSIDERATION OR REGARD TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION.

                            PAST PRACTICE BY USING STEAMROLLER MAJORITY TO (A) PREVENT FURTHER BRIEF
                            EXTENSION OF SPECIAL SESSION FOR CONSIDERATION OF VOLUMINOUS
                            PRE-PREPARED DOCUMENTS (DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AND PLAN OF ACTION),
                            FINAL TEXT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY ADEQUATELY (E.G.
                            ONE IMPORTANT AMENDMENT WAS IN FACT NOT SHOWN TO US UNTIL ADOPTION.),
                            (B) SHARPLY LIMIT MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATION DESPITE IMPORTANCE AND
                            COMPLEXITY OF SUBJECT, (C) PREVENT ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION OF DIVERSITY
                            OF VIEWS INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS PRESENTED BY OTHER UN MEMBERS AND (D) USE
                            DISPOSITION FOR CONSENSUS TO DISSUADE DISSENTERS FROM REQUIRING A
                            VOTE.</p>
                        <p>3. FOR EXAMPLE, AT APRIL 29 MEETING OF AD HOC COMMITTEE (OF THE WHOLE),
                            FRANCE, JAPAN (WITH MALAYSIA CO-SPONSOR), NEW ZEALAND (WITH SRI LANKA
                            CO-SPONSOR), AND US INTRODUCED RESOLUTIONS INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT
                            PROPOSALS MADE IN THEIR PLENARY SPEECHES. THEREUPON, DAHOMEY'S MOVE TO
                            ADJOURN DEBATE WAS ADOPTED BY UNRECORDED VOTE OF 56-16 (US)-38. DAHOMEY
                            MOTION, FROM WHICH ALMOST HALF MEMBERS PRESENT DISASSOCIATED THEMSELVES
                            IN VOTE, HAD EFFECT OF DELIBERATELY PREVENTING FURTHER DISCUSSION, AND
                            INTRODUCTION IN PLENARY, OF RESOLUTIONS IN WHICH THERE SUBSTANTIAL AND
                            VARIED GROUP INTEREST.</p>
                        <p>4. STEAM ROLLER PSYCHOLOGY INTENSIFIED TO SUCH AN EXTENT AT END OF
                            SESSION THAT SPOKESMEN FOR GROUP OF 77 SEEMED DETERMINED TO FORCE THE
                            CREATION OF AN IMPRESSION OF UNANIMITY, EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT EXIST,
                            AND TO AVOID VOTING BY SUCH MEANS AS THREATENING TO WITHDRAW NEGOTIATED
                            DOCUMENTS AND SUBMIT ORIGINAL G-77 WORKING PAPERS, AS WELL AS TELLING US
                            THAT ANY REQUEST FOR A VOTE WOULD BE CHALLENGED AND G-77/NACG MAJORITY
                            UTILIZED TO OPPOSE THE REQUEST. EFFORT TO CREATE FALSE IMPRESSION OF
                            UNANIMITY IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME WITH RESPECT TO A DOCUMENT THAT
                            BEGINS "WE THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS..." AS DOES THE
                            DECLARATION. SUCH A DOCUMENT SHOULD IN FACT BE AGREEABLE TO ALL MEMBERS,
                            WHILE DECLARATION WAS NOT. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: IN FINAL
                            ANALYSIS WHEN PLENARY TOOK UP TWO RESOLUTIONS FOR ADOPTION, WE DECIDED
                            NOT TO REQUEST VOTING, GIVEN OVERALL SITUATION. END FYI. WE DID MAKE
                            CLEAR THAT USG DID NOT BELIEVE CONSENSUS IN FACT EXISTED. ADDRESSEES IN
                            THEIR APPROACHES SHOULD CITE EXAMPLE CONTAINED THIS PARA AS ILLUSTRATION
                            OF HOW FAR STEAM ROLLER PSYCHOLOGY HAD TAKEN HOLD AND ONLY IF USE OF
                            EXAMPLE WILL ASSIST IN PRESENTATION OF OUR CONCERNS. WE PARTICULARLY
                            DESIRE WHEN THIS FACTOR IS DISCUSSED THAT NO IMPRESSION BE LEFT THAT WE
                            WOULD HAVE REGARDED IT AS PROPER OR LEGAL PROCEDURE TO DENY REQUEST OF
                            MEMBER FOR A VOTE. IN FACT, WE WOULD WISH DISCOURAGE ANY POSSIBLE BELIEF
                            BY OTHERS THAT IT WOULD BE PRACTICAL POSSIBILITY TO DENY RIGHT TO HAVE
                            VOTE ONCE IT IS REQUESTED. UN CHARTER, UNGA RULES OF PROCEDURE, AND
                            PRECEDENT OF ASSEMBLY'S OPERATIONS, REQUIRES A VOTE WHEN REQUESTED.</p>
                        <p>5. STEAMROLLER TACTICS, ESPECIALLY USE OF MAJORITY TO PREVENT
                            INTRODUCTION AND DISCUSSION OF RESOLUTIONS IN UN AS WELL AS TO DETER
                            FINAL VOTE ON ADOPTION OF RESOLUTIONS, CONTRADICT REASON FOR EXISTENCE
                            OF GA AND OTHER ASSEMBLIES IN UN SYSTEM AS DELIBERATIVE BODIES. THIS
                            SHOULD BE SEEN AS ACUTE DANGER ESPECIALLY BY THOSE COUNTRIES, MOSTLY
                            LDC'S, WHO REGARD UN AS MOST IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERNATIONAL
                            ACTION ON ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THEM. THIS EXPANDED USE OF AUTOMATIC
                            MAJORITIES WILL, IF CONTINUED, SERIOUSLY JEOPARDIZE ROLE OF UN IN MOST
                            IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. IT CAN ALSO HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES,
                            WERE IT TO RESULT IN ALIENATING US PUBLIC OPINION FROM SUPPORT FOR UN
                            AND AID TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>6. ACTION REQUESTED: UNLESS ACTION POSTS PERCEIVE IMPORTANT OBJECTIONS,
                            THEY SHOULD EXPRESS OUR DEEP AND HIGH LEVEL CONCERNS NOTED ABOVE WITH
                            HOST GOVERNMENT AT APPROPRIATELY HIGH LEVEL. EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED
                            ON WHAT WE SEE AS SERIOUS RISK TO FUTURE EFFECTIVE WORK OF UN
                            ORGANIZATION POSED BY TACTICS SUCH AS THOSE EMPLOYED AT SPECIAL SESSION.
                            POSTS SHOULD POINT OUT THAT US IN EARLY DAYS OF UN DID NOT SEEK TO
                            RESTRICT DEBATE ON ISSUES BEFORE UNGA, DESPITE STRONG MAJORITY IT COULD
                            USUALLY MUSTER IN SUPPORT ITS POSITIONS. WE BELIEVE EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE
                            BEHAVIOR SHOULD NOW BE EXPECTED FROM THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO COMMAND
                            MAJORITY IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN INTERESTS OF ORGANIZATION AS
                            A WHOLE. POSTS MAY IN THEIR DISCRETION INDICATE WE WOULD WELCOME ANY
                            COMMENTS HOST GOVERNMENTS MIGHT WISH TO MAKE ON THIS PROBLEM. PARIS,
                            ROME, TOKYO, LONDON, BONN, STOCKHOLM, OTTAWA AND CANBERRA, IN
                            PARTICULAR, SHOULD SEEK VIEWS OF HOST GOVERNMENTS ON STEPS WE MIGHT TAKE
                            INDIVIDUALLY OR IN CONCERT TO HEAD OFF STEAMROLLER TACTICS AND TO
                            FACILITATE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE LDC APPROACH IN FUTURE UN MEETINGS. WE MAY

                                >UN</gloss> Speech. It reflects that sometimes the best way to make
                            policy is to announce it and then see what needs to be done to implement
                            it. I have announced that we are willing to do something and I am
                            willing to ram it through the government if we have a good program. How
                            would you like to proceed?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">LORD</persName>: I asked each of our
                            guests to look at your UN Speech and to consider what are the
                            implications of some recent events. The question is how we should now
                            move out, with the UN Speech as a starting point but not confining our
                            discussion to that framework.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Let's take more general issues first. Who would like to
                            start?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: The first problem I see is that the developing countries as
                            a group feel that we have neglected them. We have not brought to a
                            global agenda of negotiations in this area the same conceptual framework
                            you have shown in other areas of foreign policy. Our Government is not
                            able to deal in some of the new problem areas of foreign policy,
                            including their <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> aspects.</p>
                        <p>A second problem is that the international rules of the game and
                            institutions are in trouble.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the first problem, your UN Speeches were splendid, but our
                            implementation and delivery systems are not adequate to your vision. To
                            be candid, this includes the US/UN Missions in Geneva and New York. If
                            we are to institutionalize a structure of peace internationally, we need
                            one in the US Government as well. One way to do this would be a
                            multilateral Under Secretary of State; another would be a czar, perhaps
                            within the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> structure, for US
                            multilateral affairs, including the newer issues such as Law of the
                            Sea.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Couldn't an Economic Under Secretary do it?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: It is a bit more than economics; Law of the Sea matters, for
                            example, are a non—economic subject which require much more
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>In our bilateral diplomacy we also need to give more priority to the new
                            issues. For example, in our commissions with the Soviets we should
                            discuss the World Food Conference, Law of the Sea and so forth, so that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will not always be working
                            against us in these multilateral endeavors. That is, there would be a
                            multilateral payoff for this.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What points would others like to make?</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: I think that in so many areas which involve science and
                            technology the question of institutional machinery comes up. For
                            example, to what extent are other governments involved in areas of
                            priority concern to us? Then there is the whole problem of the low
                            priority accorded to science and technology at the international level.
                            Take nuclear issues for example -- plutonium terrorism, proliferation,
                            and so forth. There is no international capability to deal with these
                            problems as nuclear plants in LDCs proliferate.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Who handles this in the Department? </p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_ETO1">Enders</persName>: <gloss target="#t_IO1"
                                >IO</gloss> and...</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: And others as well, I assume.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: SCI is involved, and outside the Department, AEC. <gloss
                                target="#t_EB1">EB</gloss> is concerned when it entails
                            international negotiations.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: <gloss target="#t_SP2">S/P</gloss> has been working on this
                            specific problem as well.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Gene's point is that we are force-feeding nuclear energy
                            and this makes the diversion problem more difficult unless we deal with
                            it a proliferation occurs.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: There are very specific problems here. For example do we have
                            a mechanism to collect and control waste plutonium?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: The time to get a hold of this is at the time of
                            force-feeding.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: This assumes we have adequate technology to deal with these
                            problems, which may not be true.</p>
                        <p>MR. LANDSBERG: Part of the problem is that we don't have leadership in
                            the US Government on this issue. But let me clear up that it is not the
                            U.S. which is force-feeding nuclear energy to LDCs, it is the world.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: Right.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: This is a problem that could be discussed in the
                            International Energy Group we set up at the Washington Conference.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: We in the U.S. are worrying about all kinds of detailed
                            decisions, on siting, for example, which affect these nuclear questions.
                            But will others? What we require to approach this problem is
                            international machinery and a willingness to use it.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: The problem now is to address the question. Solutions are
                            not yet at hand.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: The way the US Government is set up now State is left to
                            accept the international results of whatever the technical agencies
                            do.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How could State get a handle on this?</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: The <gloss target="#t_ECG1">ECG</gloss>, as you suggested, is
                            one way. Doing it as part of a general energy cooperation is
                            another.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIFOFF: State now has a legitimate role and must seize it. It is
                            leaving foreign policy to technical agencies, although there is some
                            existing <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> role. The problems of other
                            countries are relevant to our scientific and technological efforts, but
                            the technical agencies are not capable of thinking in terms of global
                            priorities.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: The health area is another example of just this problem.
                            Schistosomiasis affects 250 to 400 million people in the world, but as
                            far as I know, we have not allocated one dollar to its study.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: The drug companies have spent more au this than the US
                            Government. The U.S. has only two scientists in this field.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have no alibi for this because I can use the NSC to get
                            on top of these questions if I cannot use State. I need help identifying
                            the problems and finding solutions. As a country we need a long-term
                            strategy in each area rather than a series of ad hoc programs.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: As far as the LDCs are concerned, we have never made a
                            commitment in the <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> field to their
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do we know what to spend the money on, should we make such
                            a commitment?</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: What we need to focus on is what are the priority
                            technological problems on a global basis. Do these include the
                            technology of contraception, schistosomiasis, better rice strains?</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Can you get a group to do that?</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: The result could be a horror if one solves schistosomiasis
                            first and population last. And population is after all not a
                            technological problem.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: My difficulty is that we can give a speech but we can't
                            push implementation. The Algerians have a simple-minded solution but we
                            don't have a counterproposal. (Although one has to keep in mind that
                            resolutions don't hurt us much and that the Algerians are not that
                            serious about it.) Can you (Mr. Handler) do something on this by the
                            fail General Assembly?</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: I think so.</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: The Development Coordination Committee which I head is a
                            complementary mechanism for looking into this.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: I would like to turn to what you can do in the near term.
                            You have to turn around the House on <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: That is very important.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I can do that, if the President lets me stay in the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: Another question is what the U.S. is going to contribute to
                            the international effort for the least developed.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How much are you talking about?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: A study that I have been working on with others suggests a
                            US contribution of $500 million in the form of food aid, along the lines
                            of Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>'s proposals.
                            The U.S., the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and Japan together would
                            about half the job, and <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> the other
                            half. US leadership on this is essential.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: There was a problem on this while I was gone, with
                            Treasury, as I understand it, holding back. That can be fixed now.</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: Our effort at the UN was misdirected; it was an effort to
                            solve substance with tactics.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Do we have a proposal now? </p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: We have sent you one.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: Given that the oil prices may stay up for some years, our
                            proposal looks to the Bretton Woods forum for serious coordination work
                            over this period, complementing the UN effort.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: Another task ahead is to get a system of multilateral
                            guidelines for nationally held stocks of foodgrains.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We have objections from Agriculture on that.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: There has been some change on that score. <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> consideration of stocks has been
                            narrowed down to two options and this is apparently acceptable to
                            Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What are the options?</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: One describes Government stocks for food aid only and the
                            other Government stocks for food aid and commercial purposes. My
                            proposal on food aid was a level of 9 million tons for all purposes,
                            including Title I and II.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: The domestic politics of food aid have changed which leads me
                            to disagree with Dick (Gardner).</p>
                        <p>MR. GARNER: Dollars are still much harder to get than food.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: The considerable media and public concern with the food world
                            problem makes it easier.</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: Logically it might be better to provide dollars, but
                            politically we just don't have the same capability.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> could be
                            your political antenna on this.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What else should we be doing?</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: To stay on food for another moment, a few years down the
                            road the situation could be worse. We could face a painful choice of
                            either slowing down US meat consumption or halting our food aid
                            program.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: The first choice we face is exports versus domestic
                            consumption. Your choice is the second one.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: The choice will appear in the form of prices; the question is
                            whether the US public will be satisfied with 50 cent bread and three
                            dollar beef, since it is these prices that will ration domestic
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: But the price implications of the volume of food aid we are
                            talking about are not ominous.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: Voluntary changes in US consumption might be possible
                            especially if meat consumption were highlighted as a health issue.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: But that frightens people which is not very helpful.</p>
                        <p>MA. PARKER: The most disturbing factor in the food situation has been the
                            East European problem.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: We can handle that.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: Well perhaps, we need stock objectives for others and
                            ourselves if this is to work.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: On the Soviet deal, nobody foresaw the problem that we
                            could sell too much wheat.</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: The Soviets made a domestic policy change; contrary to past
                            practice, they didn't slaughter the herds down to a level to fit their
                            grain supplies.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: They kept on feeding.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: I feel we're describing solutions without defining the
                            problem. Les, would you like to try defining the problem?</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: Quite simply, we have a trend of rising food prices and this
                            has led to a reversal, for the first time, of the trends of declining
                            death rates and improving nutrition. I feel that a global strategy must
                            be based on a shift in emphasis from increasing supply to reducing
                            demand -- most centrally population growth. Our standing predictions on
                            population growth are no longer possible. Something has to give, the
                            birth rate or the death rate.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I wanted to use this meeting to see how you see these new
                            issues. Watergate or not this Administration has to turn to the task of
                            handing over the job to others. By that time we can at least define the
                            issues. We can get going by defining what the problems are and what are
                            the directions in which we should be moving. I would like to get
                            together on this, during the week of July 19-25. Can you (Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>) set this up? Will two hours do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: Yes. We (Handler and Brown) have a group that will he ready
                            with something by then.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You (Mr. Handler) can get a group that on science and
                            technology questions for a session around the end of July.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: One other thing I would like to mention is the UN Population
                            Conference in August.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Frankly I'm not sure I knew there was one.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: If you indicate a desire to go, it will change the whole
                            thing. For example, the Soviets will have to recognize this problem.</p>
                        <p>MR. SECRETARY: Who is coming to the Conference? </p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: That's still unclear,</p>
                        <p>TEE SECRETARY: Who are we planning to send? (Turning to Mr. Enders) Are
                            you confirmed yet?</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: No, so I can't go.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: The point is population is important and we have to do what
                            we do on this question in a multilateral framework.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What do we want to do?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: I have brought along a written proposal which I will leave.
                            First we want each country to set a population target; only a handful
                            have done so. The urgency is not recognized. For example, when I talked
                            to the Algerians, they shrugged off the problem by asserting that
                            Algeria could support double its present population. They seemed shocked
                            when I told them the demographic mathematics were such that they needed
                            to start new programs yesterday if their objective was to keep their
                            population from going much beyond double the present level. Second, we
                            want an obligation on each country to report to the UN what it is
                            doing.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Who is handling this in the Department? </p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: <persName corresp="#p_CPP1">Phil Claxton</persName>.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Someone said there is a <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> on Population.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: We are doing this and it should be completed shortly.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: The third thing we need is a strategy for reducing fertility
                            -- to include action on women's rights, jobs, education and economic
                            development.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFF: The last point is the important one.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: That's right. Historically birth rates have declined only
                            where standards of living are rising so that personal security is
                            established apart from having children. The problem is reproducing out
                            of desperation.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How do you reproduce out of desperation?</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: With high infant mortality you have many children to assure
                            that some are around later to do the work and take care of you. But
                            returning to the broader issue, the specter that bothers me is that we
                            might provide just enough food aid to keep people alive but not to raise
                            their level of nutrition and standard of living.</p>
                        <p>MR. PARKER: We are proposing that food aid be accompanied by conditions
                            in the population field.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: How do you do that internationally without appearing racist?
                            You have to convince the LDCs that population control is in their
                            interest not ours.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: One problem is that the United States is among those many
                            countries that does not have a population target.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: We could get one merely by making explicit what we know is
                            going to happen anyway.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: To return to another subject, the course of the Law of the
                            Sea Conference disturbs me very much. We are heading for a failure
                            unless the US position changes. To get approval for passage through
                            straits for submarines and so forth, which we need for security reasons,
                            we need to change our position in some other respects such as accepting
                            an international regime or authority for rule-making for seabed mining;
                            we also need to accept revenue sharing from the proceeds of seabed
                            concessions. With regard to coastal areas, where it is gas and oil that
                            are involved, we need to accept, again, both revenue sharing and a
                            degree of international authority. If we don't the Conference could
                            fail.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Dick, we haven't heard much from you.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: I don't disagree with anything that has been said, but I
                            would give these points different emphasis. Most of what has been said
                            concerns the LDCs. I think our serious differences are with Europe and
                            Japan. Elsewhere (and this includes even Canada if it gets over its
                            misconceptions regarding its own interests) the interests of other
                            countries are not that different from ours. There is a lack of follow-up
                            in our dealings with Europe and Japan.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: On which side?</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: Both sides, but ours most significantly. </p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: For example?</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: The monetary area is one example.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: That's not just follow-up; there is a fundamental
                            disagreement.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: Yes, but from 1970 on the perception of the US position in
                            Europe has been one of the U.S. letting things go, leaving it to the
                            market.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: But that is our position.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: Yes, but we don't move fast enough to protect it.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: For example?</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: When floating started we should have jumped in with proposed
                            rules for floating, since dirty floating should have been seen as
                            inevitable. We are finally there, but it took 15 months. A second
                            example is the financing of the energy crisis, where we have been too
                            passive.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Give me a solution.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: We left it to Witteven. His proposal is a step in the right
                            direction but not enough. We have left it to the oil companies and the
                            big banks. The governments have done nothing but make good statements.
                            The financial world is now very shaky. Europe's biggest banks are losing
                            their nerve about lending to Italy.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I agree but we tried and Europe insisted it could do
                            nothing that might displease the Arabs. But the Arabs don't know what
                            pleases them, which leaves the Europeans paralyzed.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: I agree that the Europeans are not playing it intelligently,
                            but the US Federal Reserve holds all the cards in terms of the world's
                            financial situation. It is not seemly for it to do something
                            unilaterally, but it could convene a group of ten to work up some
                            backing for Italy.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: Arthur Burns has been doing this, but in the usual, quiet
                            Central bankers way; in the Franklin case, for example.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: The Franklin Bank is more a domestic problem, bad real estate
                            investments in particular, although foreign exchange losses were part of
                            the problem. But the case doesn't have the same international overtones,
                            nor is Franklin a leading bank.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Where are we on this problem?</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: There is no consensus on how to deal with it. </p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Give this highest priority.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: I will. It is a range of problems. For example, it involves
                            gold.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: Be very careful on this question.</p>
                        <p>MR. LANDSBERG: Is the financing problem a temporary or long-term one?</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: It is a little of both. A sudden change in financing
                            requirements has its own problems, apart from the new situation to which
                            the banking system must adjust. This creates a certain brittleness in
                            the system during the transition. In the long term, the Italians can
                            adjust.</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: We have discussed one range of issues, concerning programs;
                            that is, what we can do. We haven't hit another set of problems deriving
                            from the fact that our organic relationships with the LDCs are
                            non-existent. We have a mass LDC-DC confrontation which prevents
                            differentiation among the various LDC groups and brings specific issues
                            to the confrontation point, multinational corporations; for example.</p>
                        <p>MR. COOPER: Issues of property and international investment have been
                            neglected for many years. There will be a radical realignment of the
                            world's concept of property. It is in our interest to set generous
                            limits on the possible outcomes. </p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I have to leave to go to the Foreign Relations Committee,
                            but these are subjects to width I want to devote a lot of time in State
                            and/or the NSC. I agree with Dick that our increased effort should be
                            broader. The LDC problems are close to intractable. In the economic area
                            generally we are stringing together programs without a strategy.</p>
                        <p>Let's get together in 4-6 weeks again. You (Mr. Handler) are doing
                            something on science and technology. You two (Messrs. Handler and Brown)
                            will do something on food. We have Dick Gardner's thing on population.
                            Dick, (Mr. Cooper) can you put down some of your thoughts?</p>
                        <p>Even if we don't get it done in this Administration we can set the
                            philosophy straight for the next. As a minimum we want to leave a
                            philosophical framework for our successors.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: This airgram provides a detailed report on the Sixth UNGA
                            Special Session which ended May 2. While restraining an interest in
                            detail with a desire for brevity, it describes the preparations for the
                            Session; the dynamics of the Session with respect to both the issues
                            before it and the behavior of delegations as regional groups and
                            individually; and the potential impact of the results on future
                            international meetings. It is intended to supplement the reference
                            telegrams.</p>
                        <p>Supporting documentation, including the texts of the two major US
                            speeches, is annexed for reference. END SUMMARY </p>

                        <p>1. Algerian President <persName corresp="#p_BHMBBB1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> formally requested the convening of a Special
                            Session of the General Assembly on January 30, largely as a reaction to
                            the Washington Energy Conference and a French proposal to hold a World
                            Energy Conference under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices. The
                            initiative was also probably intended to strengthen Algeria's leadership
                            of the Non-Aligned Group, of which it is currently president, in the
                            face of continuing competition from Yugoslavia and India. In order to
                            divert attention from the oil price issue and to rally the developing
                            countries around the theme of their "unfair" terms of trade, Boumediene
                            proposed that the Assembly deal with "the problem of raw materials and
                            development." In doing this, Algeria moved dramatically forward to
                            achieve policy goals recently reaffirmed at the 1973 Non-Aligned
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>2. The Algerian initiative caught the governments of developing countries
                            by surprise. Many, particularly the Latin Americans but some in Africa
                            and Asia as well, doubted that the Session could serve a useful purpose.
                            But Algeria quickly rallied the more active members of the Non-Aligned
                            and won their support for confronting the developed world with a call
                            for establishing new rules for international economic relations which
                            would respond to virtually all developing country demands expressed over
                            the past two decades.</p>
                        <p>3. When the preliminary confusion began to subside, delegates from
                            developing countries, caucusing as the Non-Aligned and Group of 77 in
                            New York, (1) began to prepare draft documents to table at the session.
                            They quickly took the form of a Declaration of Principles (eventually
                            entitled "Declaration on the Establishment of a New international
                            Economic Order") and a program of Action. The Declaration of Principles
                            to a large extent reformulated principles adopted at the first UN
                            Conference on Trade and Development (<gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss> I) in 1964--which, with few exceptions, the US and a
                            number of other developed countries had voted against or abstained
                            on--as well as <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> positions on similar
                            principles under negotiation in the UNCTAD Working Group on the Charter
                            of Economic Rights and Duties of States. The draft Program of Action was
                            a restatement of LDC views on economic issues--in trade policy, monetary
                            policy, development assistance, etc.,--which had been raised in UNCTAD
                            meetings since 1964 and which had been debated for a year in the 1973
                            Review and Appraisal of Implementation of the International Development
                            Strategy (the Department's A-453 of January 16, 1974, reported on that
                            exercise). The very subject of the Session, raw materials and
                            development, was a minor theme in these drafts. The pressing needs of
                            some developing countries for relief from rocketing costs of essential
                            imports was not mentioned.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Non-Aligned Group is composed of the developing countries of
                            Africa and Asia (1) except primarily for Turkey, Iran, Pakistan,
                            Thailand, the Khmer Republic and the Philippines, (2) plus Yugoslavia,
                            Malta, Cyprus, Cuba, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad, Argentina, Peru, and
                            Chile. Most Latin American countries are thus not members of the Group.
                            Historically it has focused on political issues, with anti-colonial and
                            pro-Arab positions in the forefront. The Group of 77 has been the caucus
                            of almost all developing countries (now about 100) in UNCTAD meetings.
                            Its focus has been almost exclusively economic. Both groups exclude the
                            communist states (except Yugoslavia and Cuba as noted before). Although
                            the two groups are not totally separable (about three-fourths of the
                            Group of 77 are members of the Non-Aligned), their dynamics and
                            organization are so different as to warrant distinguishing between
                            them.</p>
                        <p>4. During the last week in March, some developing countries, including
                            Iran, tabled a resolution dealing explicitly with "the adverse effects
                            of the current economic situation" at the Economic Commission for Asia
                            and the Far East (<gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>) meeting in
                            Colombo. The resolution expressed concern over the impact on developing
                            countries of worldwide inflation; sharply higher prices of oil, food
                            grains, fertilizers and industrial goods; supply shortages; etc. It
                            recognized that adequate financial assistance on appropriate terms was
                            one immediate remedy, and "warmly welcomed" commitments which the oil
                            exporting countries were making. It urged action by the international
                            financial institutions and maintenance of aid levels by the developed
                            countries. The resolution was adopted without dissent and transmitted to
                            the General Assembly for consideration at the Special Session.</p>
                        <p>5. It thus appeared immediately before the Session began that only a
                            certain number of LDC governments supported the approach to the Session
                            embodied in the draft Declaration of Principles and Program of Action
                            Prepared in New York. Others were either uninterested or hoped the
                            Assembly would deal with urgent needs in the areas of oil, food and
                            fertilizers. The United States was disturbed by the positions developing
                            in New York and was eager to see whether LDC government officials coming
                            to the Session from capitals would be able to turn their New York
                            delegations to deal with concrete, more immediate problems.</p>
                        <p>Plenary Positions</p>
                        <p>6. As representative of the government requesting the Session, President
                            Boumedienne led off the plenary speeches with a militant address which
                            emphasized the need for developing countries which are raw material
                            producers to take government action to raise the world market prices of
                            their exports. He particularly stressed the importance of nationalizing
                            production and sales processes as a means of making government control
                            over natural resources effective. Under this impetus, the right to
                            nationalization became the major sub-theme to the topic of raw materials
                            at the Session.</p>
                        <p>7. In other plenary speeches, spokesmen of developing countries almost
                            universally condemned the current structure of economic relations
                            between the developed and developing worlds. The price of oil, however,
                            became a topic of discussion from the first day. Oil producers defended
                            their actions as merely overthrowing the artificially low prices imposed
                            by the oil companies, and they urged other developing countries to
                            follow their example. The Arab oil producers pointed with pride to their
                            past and prospective assistance efforts, usually described in general
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>8. Delegates from oil-importing developing countries for the most part
                            seconded the oil-producers' positions. Several speakers called in
                            particular for LDCs to make <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>-type
                            producer arrangements to raise the price of other commodities. But
                            significant voices of dissent were heard with a certain frequency.
                            Liberian President <persName corresp="#p_TWR1">Tolbert</persName> broke
                            the ice shortly after Boumediene spoke, by calling the Assembly's
                            attention to the critical situation created for a limited number of
                            developing countries by the oil price rise in combination with other
                            rising import costs. Tolbert's views were reaffirmed by Zambia, Sierra
                            Leone, Guyana, Sri Lanka, Togo, Thailand, the Philippines, India and
                            Kenya, among others. While establishing a second theme for the Session,
                            the impact of their plenary speeches was not forceful. For example, all
                            the delegations listed above beginning with Sri Lanka spoke at or after
                            the middle of the second week.</p>
                        <p>9. Secretary Kissinger's address on April 15, with constructive proposals
                            for action, was in marked contrast to the themes of the Non-Aligned. He
                            pointed to the need for an expanding supply of energy at an equitable
                            price as the primary problem and suggested cooperative efforts to
                            conserve supplies and develop new sources of energy. For raw materials
                            he urged that an international group of experts working closely with the
                            UN Division of Resources undertake a comprehensive survey of the earth's
                            resources and help develop a global early warning system on impending
                            surpluses and scarcities. He stated that a central objective of the
                            world Food Conference (scheduled for the fall) should be to restore the
                            world's capacity to deal with famine and declared US readiness to join
                            other governments to rebuild food reserves. He expressed the hope that
                            the United States would increase its aid to developing nations from $258
                            to $675 million this year to raise their agricultural production and
                            added, "We shall make a major effort to increase the quantity of food
                            aid over the level we provided last year." He welcomed the steps the oil
                            producers have taken towards applying their new surplus revenues to help
                            meet the needs of the poorest nations to develop and to avoid starvation
                            and said that the developed nations, too, have an obligation to help. He
                            pledged US support to an early replenishment of the International
                            Development Association. He called for a cooperative effort to apply
                            science to problems of developing nations such as farming technologies,
                            birth control, energy, and to a study of climatic changes. Finally he
                            called for a commitment by both developed and developing nations for an
                            open trading system, a flexible but stable monetary system, and a
                            positive climate for the free flow of resources, both public and
                            private, to sustain the growth of the global economy. (The text of the
                            Secretary's speech is attached, Annex 3.)</p>
                        <p>10. Other developed country spokesmen for the most part limited
                            themselves to endorsing the need for improving LDC trade prospects and
                            for some reform or existing trade, aid and monetary structures. Most
                            called attention to the plight of those developing countries hardest hit
                            by oil, food and other price rises. Some made specific proposals for
                            General Assembly action. The Japanese led this category with a package
                            of five proposals aimed at improved UN capability in the field of
                            natural resources, including establishing a group of "Wise Men." The
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> also proposed a "Wise Men"
                            group. France proposed an economic monitoring center for commodities in
                            world trade, as well as supporting a general network for a larger number
                            of commodity agreements.</p>
                        <p>Action on Draft Documents</p>
                        <p>11. With regard to the Group of 77 draft texts for the Declaration of
                            principles and Program of Action, the Session functioned in two parts:
                            During the first, lasting until less than a week before the scheduled
                            close of the Session, each document received a laborious first reading
                            in an Ad Hoc Committee of the whole, during which Western and Communist
                            delegations commented on the drafts and delegations of all
                            groups--including the developing countries--proposed extensive
                            amendments. Serious, and to a certain extent successful, negotiations on
                            some paragraphs of the Declaration took place at this stage. During the
                            second part of the Session, a period of only about four working days,
                            representative delegations of the developed and developing countries
                            engaged in intense negotiations on almost every sentence of the fourteen
                            pages of the printed texts. These negotiations were far from completed
                            when they were terminated by the Group of 77 in order to avoid
                            prolonging the Session.</p>
                        <p>12. The original stated aim of the Group of 77 with regard to these two
                            documents was to reach texts which could be adopted by consensus,
                            without major statements of reservations on the part of developed
                            country delegations. If they failed to achieve this, the developing
                            country representatives indicated they would use their voting majority
                            to pass their original texts. It soon became clear, however, that
                            Western delegations simply could not swallow this heavily biased
                            presentation of economic rules and objectives, and that the Group of 77
                            was not willing to make sufficient concessions to permit a genuine
                            consensus. In the midst of the intensive period of negotiations the
                                <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> spokesmen acknowledged that
                            lengthy statements of reservations might be conceded in order to achieve
                            "consensus." Within hours of the closing session of the plenary, in the
                            face of threatened continued opposition by the US, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, FRG and perhaps Japan, the Group of 77
                            dropped their insistence that the documents be expressly adopted as the
                            "consensus" of the General Assembly. The Report of the Ad Hoc Committee
                            states without elaboration that the Committee "recommended" the adoption
                            of the documents, at that point in the form of resolutions. The record
                            of the action taken by the plenary states that the General Assembly
                            agreed, without objection, to adopt the two draft resolutions. The
                            statements by Western delegates that followed included both general
                            reservations and extensive reservations on detail. The US delegate,
                            Ambassador John Scali, in addition to putting the major US reservations
                            on the record, specifically stated that, with regard to the adoption of
                            the resolutions, "the word 'consensus' cannot be applied in this case."
                            On the other hand, most of the G-77 delegates who spoke after adoption
                            of the resolutions--as well as some Western representatives--asserted
                            that the documents represented a consensus. (See the annexes for the
                            texts of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International
                            Economic Order, Annex 1; the Program of Action, Annex 2; Ambassador
                            Scali's speech after the adoption of the Resolutions, Annex 4; and a
                            Compilation of Western Reservations, Annex 5.)</p>
                        <p>13. The heart of the Declaration of Principles is Paragraph 4 which
                            enumerates the principles on which the "new economic order" should be
                            founded. The US objected most strongly to the following: 4 (e), the
                            right of nationalization without mention of compensation or of
                            international law; 4(f), the right to restitution and compensation for
                            the exploitation and depletion of natural and other resources by foreign
                            occupation, alien or colonial domination or apartheid; 4(i), extending
                            assistance to those who, inter alia, are under alien domination, foreign
                            occupation, and apartheid, or are subject to "neo-colonialism in all its
                            forms;" 4(j), a just and equitable relationship between the prices of
                            LDC exports and their imports; and 4(t), facilitating producer
                            associations. Indeed, most of the principles are to some degree
                            objectionable to the United States.</p>
                        <p>14. Our difficulty with the Program of Action is even greater than with
                            the Declaration. (See below for a separate discussion of Part X of the
                            Program of Action, the Special Program for the Most Seriously Affected.)
                            It is the US position that issues of trade, monetary and multilateral
                            development assistance policies should be discussed and negotiated in
                            the bodies set up to deal with those subjects: the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> and the World Bank. In addition, a broad range of food
                            and related issues can best be handled at the World Food Conference next
                            November. These complex and highly technical matters cannot be
                            successfully dealt with in the UN General Assembly, especially not in
                            the restricted timeframe of a Special Session. While participating in
                            the debates and negotiations, the US opposed giving active consideration
                            to the draft Program of Action, and rejected any implication that these
                            General Assembly resolutions could bind the policies or action of
                            governments in the other major world economic institutions with regard
                            to the details of the Program of Action, there are a great many which
                            are contrary to US policy, some which are so unreasonable as to be
                            beyond the realm of the possible, and only very few which are totally
                            unobjectionable to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Action on Other Proposals, Including Special Measures for the "Most
                            Seriously Affected"</p>
                        <p>15. The Ad Hoc Committee created a Working Group (also a committee the
                            whole) to handle new proposals raised by Ministers in plenary speeches.
                            This Working Group quickly came to devote its principal attention to the
                            immediate emergency problems of the countries "Most Seriously Affected"
                            (soon dubbed the MSAs) by current economic conditions. While the Special
                            Session thus began to meet US hopes of coming to grips with real,
                            immediate issues, the Working Group and its informal sub-bodies
                            developed a proposal to establish a special program, including a new
                            Special Fund in the UN, to provide emergency relief and development
                            assistance "at least" through the end of the 1970s. The original text of
                            this proposal did reflect to a degree the priority for emergency aid
                            urged by the US and other Western countries, but was significantly
                            changed during negotiations to include long-range concerns for
                            development for MSAs and eventually for others. While this trend was
                            objectionable to Canada, Australia, Japan and the US, the revised
                            Special Program was largely acceptable to others and not objected to by
                            the <gloss target="#t_MSA2">MSA</gloss> representatives present, notably
                            India, Guyana and Pakistan. The resolution enumerated a series of
                            special measures which "the industrialized countries and other potential
                            contributors" might take, including low-term financial assistance,
                            establishment of the link between SDRs and development finance, and debt
                            renegotiation on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>16. The United States sought to focus attention on immediate needs and,
                            in order to meet them quickly, the use of existing organizations. The
                            G-77 delegates, on the other hand, insisted on establishing a new UN
                            institution and on projecting the continuation of "special measures"
                            over an extended period of time. Two days before the end of the Session,
                            the US counter proposed a resolution based to a large extent on the LDC
                            draft but establishing a $4 billion target for additional assistance to
                            the MSAs over the following eighteen months. The target could be met by
                            various forms of non-project bilateral and multilateral assistance,
                            including commodity assistance on concessional terms. Bilateral and
                            multilateral actions would be monitored by an Ad Hoc Committee in the
                            UN, which would not have a direct assistance function itself. The Group
                            of 77 refused to give formal consideration to the US proposal, and,
                            although it was circulated as a conference document, no opportunity was
                            provided it to be introduced and discussed in any forum at the Session.
                            (See Annex 6.)</p>
                        <p>17. Several other proposals were introduced as draft resolutions and
                            considered by the Working Group. One, jointly sponsored by Sri Lanka and
                            New Zealand, called for urgent measures to meet the fertilizer needs of
                            the developing countries, including the creation of a "fertilizer pool"
                            under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Others
                            called for the creation of new bodies to investigate and act on raw
                            materials problems (including energy) and other matters before this
                            Special Session. These included the US proposal for the establishment of
                            a Group of Eminent Persons to study natural resources and make
                            recommendations on an early warning system for surpluses and scarcities.
                            The French, eschewing collaboration with other Western delegations,
                            pushed two proposals: the "economic observatory" raised in their plenary
                            speech, and an "inter-sessional committee" dealing with energy, in
                            particular to provide a forum for a "preparatory dialogue" between
                            producers and consumers.</p>
                        <p>18. The Group of 77 decided in the closing days of the Session, however,
                            that all-of these additional proposals would not be considered by the Ad
                            Hoc Committee until after action had been taken on the Declaration,
                            Program of Action, and Special Program for the MSAs. In the end, because
                            of the prolonged negotiations on the first two documents, the other
                            draft resolutions were merely referred to the Economic and Social
                            Council which had already begun its regular spring session (except for
                            the US alternative to the Special Program for the MSAs which had already
                            been rejected by the developing countries).</p>
                        <p>19. The US had hoped until the closing days of the Session that (1) the
                            proposals for special measures for the MSAs, including the Sri Lanka
                            fertilizer proposal, and heightened UN capability to consider raw
                            materials problems would emerge as the major accomplishments of the
                            Session and that (2) faced with the impossibility of a consensus
                            formulation on the Program of Action, the Group of 77 would agree to
                            merely passing it on to other bodies for further consideration. These,
                            hopes were not realized. First, other developed country delegations,
                            with few exceptions, quickly accepted the Group of 77 offer to adopt a
                            somewhat modified program of Action by consensus with lengthy statements
                            of reservation. Second, the Group of 77 eventually insisted on attaching
                            the Special Program for the MSAs to the Program of Action as the last of
                            the Program of Action's ten parts. It insisted at the same time that the
                            Declaration and Program of Action be considered together as a package.
                            Last, the decision to refer all other draft resolutions onward to <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> confirmed the success of those
                            LDC delegations which had sought to use the Assembly to reaffirm their
                            views on the international economic order.</p>
                        <p>Attitudes of Groups and Individual Delegations </p>
                        <p>20. The LDCs. To a large extent the behavior of individual delegations
                            reflected the personal preferences of their principal leader or even of
                            the delegation member handling a specific subject, so firm
                            characterization of many of them is difficult. It was clear during the
                            Session, however, that a group of ideologically more hard-line
                            delegations--who may be called the radicals--largely dominated the Group
                            of 77. This subgroup was led by Algeria, with the strong support (at
                            least when in view of Western delegations) of Iraq, Zaire, Uganda, and
                            Guinea. Libya adhered to this subgroup, and its leadership enjoyed the
                            support or at least the acquiescence of the major centers of "oil
                            money": Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It is this group which preached a
                            new economic order which even grudgingly accepted amendments
                            "weakenings" their original texts, which damned Western criticisms of
                            their proposals as reactionary, and which apparently would have been
                            pleased to see the US isolated in a negative vote.</p>
                        <p>21. A significant subgroup of moderates within the Group of 77 opposed
                            the radicals. They succeeded in appointing Indian delegate <persName
                                corresp="#p_LKB1">K. B. Lall</persName> and Venezuelan Minister
                            Perez Guerrero as the principal G-77 spokesmen and determined that the
                            Group would seek to negotiate substantial and sweeping compromises to
                            the Declaration of Principles and Program of Action in an effort to win
                            maximum support from Western delegations. They did not, however, gain
                            control of the Group of 77, which remained under the influence of
                            Algeria and the other radicals.</p>
                        <p>22. Apparently the weakest element within the Group of 77 was the Most
                            Seriously Affected themselves with regard to the pursuit of their
                            special interests. Various motives are possible for their meek demeanor:
                            They--as well as other LDCs--were clearly reluctant to identify their
                            positions with the United States or with the developed world in general.
                            Secondly, the Arab oil producers and Iran had said enough about
                            providing assistance to them that the MSAs could not risk offending
                            them. The expectation of private bilateral deals probably quieted
                            some.</p>
                        <p>23. Conspicuous for the almost negligible role they played were the Latin
                            Americans. The Brazilian delegation made no plenary speech and limited
                            its efforts to making certain that the criteria for the Special Program
                            for MSAS were not so strict as to preclude their benefiting from it. The
                            Argentines spoke infrequently in support of G-77 positions. The
                            Venezuelans, because of Perez Guerrero, were more active participants.
                            The remainder were scarcely heard from. It was clear that the Washington
                            Meeting of Foreign Ministers and the Atlanta <gloss target="#t_OAS1"
                                >OAS</gloss> General Assembly, which coincided with the Special
                            Session, were the forums of real interest to them and they were largely
                            observers at the General Assembly,</p>
                        <p>24. Developed Countries. Grouped together as the Western Europeans and
                            Others (WEOs), the developed countries suffered serious lack of unity.
                            Only certain members of the European Community (the UK, FRG, Belgium,
                            France and Italy) and Japan were willing to join the US in speaking
                            against LDC positions at all. The Scandinavians, Australia and New
                            Zealand in their infrequent interventions either supported G-77
                            aspirations or urged that a happy solution be found to differences of
                            view. Canada simply remained silent during discussions on the
                            Declaration and Program of Action. (The Canadian and Australian
                            delegates covering the negotiations on the special Program for MSAs,
                            however, actively argued positions consistent with US views.) It became
                            clear to all delegations early in the Session that the Group of 77 had
                            only to focus on the US, the <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss> and
                            Japan. In that effort, the other developed country delegations were in
                            effect silent partners.</p>
                        <p>25. Communist Countries. The issues raised by the Eastern Europeans under
                            Soviet leadership and by the Communist Chinese became merely a sideshow
                            to the main event of the LDC/DC negotiations described above. The
                            principle Soviet thrust was to insert in the G-77 drafts congratulatory
                            and hortatory references to detente and peaceful coexistence. The
                            Chinese struggled to frustrate Soviet initiatives and to delete the
                            concept of interdependence from the draft texts. The Group of 77
                            response was to reject amendments from both sides, leaving the Soviets
                            relatively unhappy and the Chinese relatively satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Follow-On Events</p>
                        <p>26. Under the terms of the Special Program for MSAs, a 36-member Ad Hoc
                            Committee of the General Assembly was created to monitor emergency
                            action to assist the MSAs, and make recommendations on the establishment
                            of the UN special Fund. The Committee's report, including its
                            recommendations with regard to the Special Fund, will be considered by
                            ECOSOC in July and by the General Assembly in the fall. Me have informed
                            the President of the General Assembly of the US desire to be a Member of
                            that Committee. The Sri Lanka/New Zealand resolution on a special
                            fertilizer program largely to be designed by the <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                >FAO</gloss> and a Japanese Proposal endorsing the Natural Resources
                            Revolving Fund have been adopted by ECOSOC.</p>
                        <p>27. In addition to creating these new programs, the work of the Special
                            Session will have immediate and direct impact on several on-going UN
                            activities. (1) The fourth and final session of the UNCTAD Working Group
                            on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States will meet in
                            Mexico City in June. Several proposed paragraphs of the draft Charter
                            deal with issues treated--contrary to US positions in many instances--in
                            the resolutions adopted at the Special Session. Consideration of the
                            Charter will also be a major item on the Agenda of this fall's regular
                            General Assembly. (2) At its summer session in July, ECOSOC will receive
                            a report from a Group of Eminent Persons studying the multinational
                            corporations. The issue before ECOSOC will be whether to take steps
                            towards formulating a Code of Conduct which would purport to regulate
                            MNC activities. The intent of the Group of 77 to push ahead on this Path
                            was reaffirmed at the Special Session. (3) The US draft resolution on a
                            Group of Eminent Persons on raw materials, as well as other major draft
                            resolutions emanating from the Special Session will also be considered
                            at ECOSOC's summer session. (4) In addition to considering reports on
                            the Special Program for MSAs, next fall's General Assembly will probably
                            see further discussion of the Declaration and Program of Action as a
                            whole, as LDC leaders seek to push forward with establishing their "new
                            international economic order." Algerian Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> will be President of the
                            General Assembly at the next session, and the Program of Action calls on
                            the General Assembly to review the implementation of its provisions as a
                            priority item. (5) LDC delegations to the upcoming World Food Conference
                            can be expected to seek to maintain the tactical advantage of bloc unity
                            which they used so successfully at the Special Session. While food
                            problems per se did not receive major attention at the Special Session,
                            developing countries at the World Food conference will probably replay
                            the theme of sustained high prices for LDC exports--with assistance from
                            developed countries for those LDCs which cannot afford to buy at high
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>28. Two major events already scheduled for 1975 will be significantly
                            affected by the Special Session. The entire economic side of the UN
                            system will undertake a mid-term Review and Appraisal of the
                            International Development Strategy which was adopted in 1970 to guide
                            the UN's Second Development Decade. The exercise will probably result in
                            modifications of the Strategy to express the more extreme positions in
                            the Declaration and Program of Action. Lastly, another Special Session
                            of the General Assembly has been scheduled for September 1975 to
                            consider development questions.</p>
                        <p>Results of the Session</p>
                        <p>29. The hitching of the Group of 77 numerical majority to two documents
                            seriously offensive to the United States and many other Western powers
                            is a cause of major concern. The Department's telegram "UNGA Sixth
                            Special Session-- Steamroller Tactics" (State 104050 of May 17)
                            summarizes the Department's position in this regard. We object to the
                            manner in which Western views were overridden. We equally object to the
                            willingness of the LDCs to adopt resolutions without adequate regard to
                            practical problems of implementation and even--so evidently the case at
                            the Special Session--without adequate consideration. We are exploring
                            ways to arrest this unfavorable trend, to reach truer, more broadly
                            based consensus, and to strengthen the UN's ability to respond to urgent
                            world problems.</p>
                        <p>30. With particular regard to the countries faced with pressing economic
                            needs because of current economic conditions, the Session did not result
                            in adequate action from the US point of view. It did provide a forum for
                            focusing attention on the Problem and airing the issues. Our proposal
                            for a $4 billion target approach was welcomed informally by many
                            developing countries and Western Europeans. The oil producers were
                            subjected to pressure from the MSAs and other developing countries
                            during the many hours of G-77 caucuses. As the crisis continues, there
                            will be pressure for more than rhetoric to meet the needs of the Most
                            Seriously Affected. There will be further opportunities for action both
                            in the UN and elsewhere: in addition to the new UN Special Program,
                            pressures from the LDCs will no doubt be brought to bear in the IMF, the
                            World Food Conference, FAO meetings and perhaps in further international
                            meetings on energy. The Special Session thus represented the first step
                            by the international community at the governmental level in seeking to
                            devise solutions for the problems of the Most Seriously Affected.</p>

                        <p>1. 29TH <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> GENERAL ASSEMBLY (UNGA) WILL
                            OPEN SEPTEMBER 17. AS IN RECENT YEARS, SESSION LIKELY TO BE DOMINATED BY
                            CONCERNS OF NON-ALIGNED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (<gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S), PARTICULARLY AS REFLECTED BY MORE
                            ACTIVIST LEADERS. FOR LARGE MAJORITY OF WORLD'S POORER AND EX-COLONIAL
                            NATIONS, WHO FEEL STRONG NEED TO REDRESS THEIR LACK OF POLITICAL,
                            MILITARY, OR ECONOMIC POWER AND INFLUENCE, UNGA SEEMS INTERNATIONAL
                            ARENA WHERE THEIR "POWER" CAN BE EXPRESSED BY VOTES. HERE THEY HOPE TO
                            USE THEIR VOTING MAJORITY TO FORCE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (DC'S) TO PAY
                            MORE ATTENTION TO THEIR VIEWS AND COMMIT DC'S TO SHARING MORE OF THEIR
                            WEALTH. MAINTENANCE OF NONALIGNED COHESION IS ESSENTIAL POLITICAL FACTOR
                            FOR THEM. CHARGE THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DIVIDE LDC'S IS OFTEN QUITE
                            ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN LDCS AWAY FROM CLOSE COOPERATION WITH DC'S. THIS
                            GIVES <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND OTHER DC'S LITTLE ROOM FOR
                            MANEUVER, EVEN WHEN LDC NATIONS IMPINGE ON IMPORTANT US INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>2. LDC UNITY MAY BEGIN TO FALTER, PARTICULARLY AS RESOURCE-POOR LDC'S
                            COME TO RESENT OIL AND RESOURCE-RICH ONES, HOWEVER, THAT TIME HAS NOT
                            YET COME AS POORER COUNTRIES STILL HOPE TO GAIN RESOURCES FROM OIL
                            STATES PRINCIPALLY BY FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN PRESSURE. MOREOVER, DC'S
                            THEMSELVES WORK UNDER RESTRAINTS IN COMBINING AGAINST LDC BLOC ACTION,
                            SOME RETAIN SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH EX-COLONIAL AREAS AND MOST ARE
                            DEPENDENT ON OIL AND-OTHER RAW MATERIALS.</p>
                        <p>3. IN FACE OF GROWING LDC DOMINATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY WE HAVE IN
                            RECENT YEARS ADOPTED LARGELY DAMAGE-LIMITING STRATEGY, OPTING OUT OF
                            EARLIER POLICY OF LEADERSHIP. WEAKNESS OF THIS APPROACH WAS ITS
                            DEFENSIVENESS, INCONSISTENCY WITH WIDELY PERCEIVED US LEADERSHIP ROLE,
                            AND INABILITY TO PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. ON SOME ISSUES, SUCH AN
                            APPROACH MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE. ON WHOLE, HOWEVER, OUR ASSESSMENT OF SIXTH
                            SPECIAL SESSION AND REVIEW OF MANY EXCELLENT COMMENTS FROM FIELD ON
                            NONALIGNED ISSUES (STATE 99105 AND 194050) LEAD US TO CONCLUDE U.S.
                            INTERESTS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED BY MORE ACTIVE AND POSITIVE
                            APPROACH.</p>
                        <p>4. U.S. OBJECTIVE AT 29TH <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> WILL BE TO
                            ENCOURAGE UN TO TAKE STEPS WHICH ARE RIPE FOR ACHIEVEMENT AND WHICH CAN
                            BE OF PRACTICAL BENEFIT TO A MAJORITY OF ITS MEMBERS. BY STRESSING
                            PROGRAMS IN WHICH NON-ALIGNED THEMSELVES SHOULD BE PRINCIPAL
                            BENEFICIARIES, BY EMPHASIZING OUR OPPOSITION TO RACISM AND RESIDUAL
                            COLONIALISM, WE HOPE TO REDUCE EXTENT OF CONFRONTATION WITH NONALIGNED
                            GROUP.</p>
                        <p>5. AT SAME TIME, WE WILL STRONGLY OPPOSE ACTIONS CLEARLY PREJUDICIAL TO
                            US INTERESTS; EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD BRING US INTO SOME CONFLICT WITH
                            LDCS AND NON-ALIGNED GROUP. WE MUST, FOR EXAMPLE, SEEK LDC RECOGNITION
                            THAT THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM CANNOT BE REMADE
                            OVERNIGHT. LIKEWISE, WE WILL OPPOSE PROPOSALS FOR UNREALISTIC MANDATORY
                            ACTION BY <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO
                            REGISTER NEGATIVE VOTES ON ILL-CONCEIVED PARAGRAPHS IN RESOLUTIONS WHICH
                            WE MAY NOT WISH TO OPPOSE AS A WHOLE. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE SEEK GREATER
                            UNDERSTANDING OF FACT THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT, IN LONGER
                            RUN, ADOPT PROGRAMS OF LDC MAJORITY OVER OPPOSITION OF MEMBERS WHOSE
                            FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS REQUIRED. WE WILL URGE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF
                            INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY TECHNICAL ORGANS, FOR INTENDED
                            PURPOSES AND GREATER RESPECT FOR PROPER PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES AN FOR
                            THE VIEWS OF THE NUMERICAL MINORITY.</p>
                        <p>6. WITHIN THESE LIMITS, WE WILL SEEK EXERCISE MORE POSITIVE LEADERSHIP.
                            PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TO GIVE KEY OFFICIALS ANALYSIS OF OUR OVERALL
                            GA OBJECTIVES PLUS DISCUSSION FORTHCOMING GA WITH HOST GOVERNMENT.
                                (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH <gloss

                        <p>7. WHICH OF THESE ISSUES SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AS WELL AS LEVEL AT WHICH
                            THEY RAISED IS LEFT TO DISCRETION OF CHIEF OF MISSION. TO ONE DEGREE OR
                            ANOTHER, WE WOULD EXPECT SOME DISCUSSION WITH ALL FRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS.
                            IN ADDITION, WE WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY A FEELING THAT USG IS SPECIFICALLY
                            INTERESTED IN CONSULTATIONS WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, IRAN,
                            YUGOSLAVIA, ALGERIA, EGYPT, INDONESIA, AND NIGERIA, COUNTRIES WITH WHOM
                            WE SHARE IMPORTANT BILATERAL INTERESTS. OBJECTIVE IS NOT MERELY TO
                            MOBILIZE SUPPORT BUT TO LEARN HOW THEY VIEW UPCOMING SESSION, AND OF
                            COURSE YOUR REPORTS SHOULD BE INFO USUN.</p>
                        <p>8. SOUTH AFRICA: SINCE 1970, UNGA ANNUALLY HAS VOTED TO AMEND CREDENTIALS
                            COMMITTEE'S REPORT SO AS TO REJECT SOUTH AFRICA'S CREDENTIALS. SINCE
                            THEN, GA PRESIDENTS HAVE RULED THAT SUCH VOTE CONSTITUTES CONDEMNATION
                            OF AND WARNING TO SOUTH AFRICA, BUT THAT AS CREDENTIALS CORRECTLY
                            SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULES OF PROCEDURE, VOTE HAS NO PRACTICAL
                            EFFECT. WITH ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER THIS YEAR'S GA PRESIDENT THIS
                            RULING MIGHT NOT BE MADE OR, IF MADE, MIGHT BE PUT TO VOTE ON AFRICAN
                            INITIATIVE. AFRICANS MAY TRY TO OBTAIN EXCLUSION OF SOUTH AFRICA FROM
                            ASSEMBLY OR COULD ASK SC TO CONSIDER SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION UNDER
                            ARTICLES 5 OR 6 OF CHARTER. US OBJECTIVE IS TO AVOID EITHER RESULT.
                            POSTS SHOULD URGE HOST GOVERNMENTS EXAMINE CAREFULLY IMPACT OF DAMAGING
                            PRECEDENT WHICH MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED FOR ALL GOVERNMENTS AND POSSIBLE
                            DAMAGE TO UN IF MEMBER STATE EXPELLED BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENT WITH ITS
                            INTERNAL POLICIES. PRESSURE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ON SOUTH AFRICAN
                            GOVERNMENT THROUGH UN ORGANIZATIONS IN WHICH SOUTH AFRICA MUST BE
                            PRESENT IF PRESSURE IS TO HAVE EFFECT. POST SHOULD ASSURE HOST
                            GOVERNMENTS THAT USG OPPOSITION TO EXPULSION OF SOUTH AFRICA IN NO WAY
                            ALTERS OUR STRONG OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID AND THAT USG CONTINUES TAKE
                            LEADING ROLE IN EFFORTS TO FOSTER RACIAL EQUALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA (E.G.
                            EQUAL PAY FOR NON-WHITES IN US-OWNED FACTORIES IN SOUTH AFRICA,
                            ASSIGNMENT OF BLACK OFFICERS TO US DIPLOMATIC POSTS THERE, AND CONTACTS
                            WITH ALL RACES.)</p>
                        <p>9. PORTUGUESE TERRITORIES: WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY PORTUGAL'S DECISION OFFER
                            INDEPENDENCE TO ANGOLA, G-B, AND MOZAMBIQUE. GOP IS RESISTING SOUTH
                            AFRICAN OR RHODESIAN INFLUENCE AND CONSULTING WITH AFRICANS. POSTS
                            SHOULD INDICATE WE SUPPORT COMPLETION OF THIS PROCESS AS RAPIDLY AS
                            REALITIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND PORTUGAL PERMIT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
                            GOOD RELATIONS WITH THESE NEW STATES. WE BELIEVE PORTUGAL ACTING IN GOOD
                            FAITH AND HER DELICATE TASK SHOULD NOT BE COMPLICATED BY HORTATORY UNGA
                            RESOLUTIONS. INTERESTED STATES SHOULD RESPOND WITH CONSIDERED ADVICE AND
                            ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN PUBLIC PRESSURES.</p>
                        <p>10. RHODESIA: GA MAY AGAIN CALL ON UK TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO
                            ELIMINATE SMITH REGIME AND MAY CALL FOR AID TO RHODESIAN LIBERATION
                            MOVEMENTS. IF ASKED, POSTS MAY SAY US REMAINS SYMPATHETIC TO CONCERNS OF
                            AFRICANS UNDERLYING PROPOSALS ON RHODESIA BUT MUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE
                            EXTREME SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION AGAINST RHODESIA. OUR POSITION ON
                            RESOLUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON LANGUAGE OF DRAFT TEXTS.</p>
                        <p>11. NAMIBIA: INDICATIONS ARE SOUTH AFRICA DOES NOT INTEND LIVE UP TO

                            SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA TO INDUCE WITHDRAWAL FROM TERRITORY. US
                            ACCEPTS CONCLUSION OF 1971 <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> DECISION
                            THAT SOUTH AFRICA OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW FROM NAMIBIA AND HAS INDICATED TO

                            NAMIBIA. NONETHELESS WE DO NOT BELIEVE SANCTIONS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN
                            REMOVING SOUTH AFRICA FROM NAMIBIA, AND OUR ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN THAT
                            SOUTH AFRICA COULD SURVIVE ECONOMICALLY EVEN IF EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS
                            COULD BE ADOPTED. OUR VOTES WILL BE DETERMINED BY WORDING OF
                            RESOLUTIONS.</p>
                        <p>12. KHMER CREDENTIALS: DEPT CONSIDERS THIS POTENTIALLY MOST TROUBLESOME

                            HOPE THAT ASEAN COUNTRIES WILL BE IN LEAD. IN PRE-UNGA CONSULTATIONS,

                            THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO GIVE NEW IMPETUS TO ADHERENCE TO NPT AND
                            TO STRENGTHENING OF NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME. WHILE US STUDYING
                            POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ACCESSION TO NPT A CONDITION FOR RECEIVING NUCLEAR
                            EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS, IT SEEMS THAT UNLESS ALL SUPPLIER NATIONS WERE
                            TO ENFORCE SUCH A CONDITION, RECIPIENT NATIONS WOULD MERELY TURN TO

                            TO STRESS IMPORTANCE OF ADEQUATE VERIFICATION. POSTS SHOULD INDICATE OUR
                            CONTINUING CONVICTION THAT "NATIONAL" MEANS OF VERIFICATION DO NOT YET

                            MINIMIZE CHANCES OF VIOLATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE BAN. US-SOVIET
                            THRESHOLD TEST BAN AGREEMENT OF 1974, WHICH PROHIBITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS
                            TESTING OVER THE 150-KILOTON LEVEL AFTER MARCH 31, 1976, IS DESIGNED TO
                            NAIL DOWN PRESENTLY ATTAINABLE AREA OF AGREEMENT, AND IN OUR VIEW
                            CONSTITUTES A STEP TOWARD AN EVENTUAL CTB. IN ADDITION, US CONTINUES

                            SHOULD SAY WE SHARE SPONSORS' STATED FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE--MAINTENANCE
                            OF PEACE AND TRANQUILITY IN INDIAN OCEAN REGION. IN THIS CONNECTION WE
                            REMAIN CONCERNED TO AVOID COMPETITIVE EXPANSION OF MILITARY AND NAVAL
                            STRENGTH IN THE AREA, AND AS US OFFICIALS HAVE PUBLICLY STATED, WOULD BE
                            RECEPTIVE TO ANY REASONABLE SUGGESTIONS REGARDING RESTRAINTS ON MILITARY
                            ACTIVITY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE IT UNWISE TO
                            IMPOSE, AS INTENDED BY THE ORIGINAL (1971) GA PEACE ZONE RESOLUTION, A
                            SPECIAL REGIME OVER A SPECIFIED AREA WHICH WOULD LIMIT TRADITIONAL HIGH
                            SEAS FREEDOMS. WHILE WE HAVE FEW DETAILS ON IRANIAN MENFZ ITEM, IRAN
                            APPARENTLY HOPES UNGA CONSIDERATION OF ITEM WILL FOCUS ATTENTION ON
                            SERIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IN THE REGION, HELP SHORE
                            UP NPT, AND RESULT IN A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR STUDIES TO BE REPORTED TO

                            REGION ITSELF, ALTHOUGH EGYPT HAS JOINED AS A CO-SPONSOR OF THE ITEM AND
                            IRAN HOPES TO GAIN SUCH OTHER CO-SPONSORS AS SYRIA, LEBANON AND TURKEY.
                            US WOULD MEASURE ANY SPECIFIC MENFZ PROPOSAL AGAINST FOUR CRITERIA WE
                            SET FORTH IN 1965: (A) INITIATIVE FOR SUCH ZONE SHOULD COME FROM THE
                            STATES IN THE REGION CONCERNED; (B) THE ZONE SHOULD INCLUDE ALL STATES
                            IN THE AREA WHOSE PARTICIPATION IS DEEMED IMPORTANT; (C) CREATION OF THE
                            ZONE SHOULD NOT UPSET NECESSARY SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS; AND (D)
                            PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE FOR ADEQUATE VERIFICATION. IF QUERIED RE
                            MENFZ, POSTS MAY NOTE OTHER NUCLEAR-FREE ZONES (LATIN AMERICA,
                            ANTARCTICA, OUTER SPACE, AND THE SEABED) HAVE MET THESE FOUR CRITERIA

                            CONVERSATIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, POSTS SHOULD
                            STRESS THAT US WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ITS RESERVATIONS TO

                            WILL BE ONE OF MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ITEMS ON AGENDA OF 29TH GA, AT ANY
                            RATE IF ITS SUBSTANCE IS ADDRESSED. THERE WILL BE FURTHER PRE-UNGA
                            NEGOTIATIONS ON DRAFT CHARTER TEXT IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AT ANNUAL SESSION
                            OF THE <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT
                            BOARD. IT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS STAGE WHETHER THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE
                            CONCLUSIVE. IF THEY ARE NOT, FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS WILL TAKE PLACE EITHER
                            AT THE GA OR AT SUCH FURTHER SESSIONS OF THE UNCTAD WORKING GROUP ON THE
                            CHARTER WHICH THE GA MAY AUTHORIZE. A KEY AREA OF CONTINUING
                            DISAGREEMENT IS LDC CONTENTION THAT "PERMANENT SOVEREIGNTY OVER NATURAL
                            RESOURCES" INCLUDES RIGHT UNLIMITED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW TO
                            NATIONALIZATION OF FOREIGN PROPERTY. SIMILARLY, LDC'S HAVE INSISTED ON
                            EXCESSIVE STATEMENT OF RIGHTS OF HOST GOVERNMENTS RESPECTING
                            MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
                            POSTS MAY SAY THAT ADOPTION OF CHARTER ACCEPTABLE TO THE US AND OTHER
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WOULD BE MAJOR STEP IN ESTABLISHING CONSTRUCTIVE
                            GUIDELINES BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN UN FORUMS;
                            FAILURE WOULD REINFORCE PATTERN OF CONFRONTATION REFLECTED AT UNGA SIXTH
                            SPECIAL SESSION. WE HOPE TO REACH COMPROMISE ON ISSUES OF NATURAL
                            RESOURCES AND MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ON BASIS OF BALANCED LANGUAGE
                            PRESERVING US POSITIONS BUT PROSPECTS ARE UNCLEAR. WE ALSO SEEK TO
                            DELETE A SET OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES LARGELY EMANATING FROM THE UNGA
                            SIXTH SPECIAL SESSION, INCLUDING PRODUCERS' ASSOCIATIONS, INDEXATION OF
                            COMMODITY PRICES, AND RESTITUTION FOR LOSSES SUFFERED UNDER COLONIALISM.

                            SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR MSA'S ADOPTED AT SIXTH SPECIAL SESSION WAS LDC
                            PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL FUND TO PROVIDE "EMERGENCY RELIEF AND
                            DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE." INCEPTION OF FUND'S OPERATIONS TARGETED FOR
                            JANUARY 1, 1974 WILL REQUIRE A FURTHER GA RESOLUTION SETTING FUND'S
                            SCOPE, MACHINERY AND MODES OF OPERATION. GA ACTION SHOULD BE BASED ON
                            RECOMMENDATIONS BY AN AD HOC COMMITTEE OF 36 WHICH MET IN JUNE WITHOUT
                            REACHING ANY CONCLUSIONS. AD HOC COMMITTEE WILL MEET AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER
                            AND PROBABLY DURING GA SESSION AS WELL. US RECOGNIZES THAT CERTAIN
                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL
                            CAPITAL FLOWS ON CONCESSIONAL TERMS AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OIL, FOOD
                            AND OTHER PRICES. BECAUSE OF THE DIMENSIONS AND IMMEDIACY OF THESE
                            NEEDS, WE AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES STRONGLY FAVOR USE OF EXISTING
                            BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL CHANNELS FOR PROVIDING AND COORDINATING
                            ASSISTANCE. IN CONVERSATIONS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES YOU SHOULD POINT OUT
                            THAT WHILE UN HAS ROLE (SEE EMERGENCY OPERATION BELOW) WE DO NOT BELIEVE
                            UN SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT OF A NEW SPECIAL FUND
                            FOR THIS EFFORT. (SEE STATE 166122, JULY 31) SHOULD LDCS PERSIST IN
                            MOVING AHEAD WITH FUND IN FACE OF RESISTANCE OF POTENTIAL DONORS, WE
                            CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT THAT FUND'S TERMS OF REFERENCE FOCUS ASSISTANCE IN
                            MEETING IMMEDIATE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS NEEDS RATHER THAN EVOLVING INTO
                            LONG-TERM OR PERMANENT DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE INSTITUTION COMPETITIVE
                            WITH ESTABLISHED BODIES. OTHER POSTS SHOULD RAISE ON "IF ASKED" BASIS OR
                            IF THEY CONSIDER DISCUSSION THIS TOPIC PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. (B) SYG'S

                            PROGRESS OF HIS EMERGENCY OPERATION AIMED AT INDUCING POTENTIAL DONORS
                            TO TAKE EMERGENCY MEASURES, THROUGH BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL CHANNELS,
                            TO "MAINTAIN UNIMPAIRED ESSENTIAL IMPORTS FOR THE DURATION OF THE COMING
                            TWELVE MONTHS." MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRY DONORS HAVE EITHER MADE SPECIFIC
                            PLEDGES TO EMERGENCY OPERATION (WHILE NOT CHANNELING FUNDS THROUGH UN)
                            OR ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO DO SO. FYI: US INTENDS TO REPLY TO SYG'S
                            APPEAL PRIMARILY THROUGH BILATERAL CHANNELS. WE EXPECT PRINCIPAL US
                            RESPONSE WILL BE IN FORM OF FOOD AID, I.E. EXPANDED PL-480 PROGRAM FOR
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75. HOWEVER, WITH EARLIER CROP
                            FORECASTS REVISED SHARPLY DOWNWARD AS A RESULT OF MIDDLE WESTERN
                            DROUGHT, FINAL DECISION ON INCREASED FOOD AID IS STILL PENDING. WE HAVE
                            ALSO REQUESTED A $225 MILLION INCREASE IN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
                            AUTHORIZATION FOR FY 75, SOME OF WHICH IS INTENDED TO FINANCE FERTILIZER
                            AND OTHER INPUTS OF IMMEDIATE BENEFIT TO MSAS. TIMING AND OUTCOME OF
                            CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF AID LEGISLATION IS, HOWEVER, NOT YET
                            CLEAR. ZND FYI. MAJOR QUESTION FACING US IS HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT OIL
                            IMPORTERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN EMERGENCY OPERATION. DONORS HAVE AGREED TO
                            MEET WITH SYG AT MINISTERIAL LEVEL IN SEPTEMBER TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS AND
                            ISSUES ARISING IN EMERGENCY OPERATION. ALL POSTS MAY DRAW ON THIS

                            DURING THE UNGA, AS A RESULT INDIRECTLY OF REPORT OF EMINENT PERSONS ON
                            IMPACT OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS RELEASED JUNE 9 OR DIRECTLY AS
                            REFERRED TO UNGA BY RESUMED 57TH SESSION OF ECOSOC, MEETING THIS FALL.
                            RESOLUTION ON REPORT WHICH EMERGED FROM THE SUMMER SESSION OF THE 57TH
                            ECOSOC INVITES ALL COUNTRIES To MAKE VIEWS KNOWN TO SPECIAL
                            INTERCESSIONAL COMMITTEE, AND APPROVES IN PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHMENT OF
                            PERMANENT MACHINERY TO ASSIST ESOSOC IN DEALING WITH ISSUE OF MNCS.
                            INTERCESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS TO RECOMMEND PRIORTIES FOR PROGRAM OF WORK
                            ON FULL RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO MNCS AS WELL AS FOR PERMANENT
                            MACHINERY NEEDED TO DEVELOP PROGRAM OF WORK. COMMITEE IS TO REPORT TO
                            RESUMED 57TH SESSION OF ECOSOC WHICH WILL TAKE FINAL DECISION ON
                            PERMANENT MACHINERY AND ITS MANDATE. IN CONVERSATION IN UNDEVELOPED
                            COUNTRES YOU MAY SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THE REPORT STRIKES A NEGATIVE TONE
                            AND LACKS BALANCE WITH ITS EMPHASIS LARGELY PLACED ON RESTRICTING MNCS.
                            REPORT ALSO REFLECTS STRONG BIAS IN FAVOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AS OPPOSED TO
                            PRIVATE DECISION-MAKING. IT SHOWS LITTLE AWARENESS THAT PRIVATE FOREIGN
                            INVESTMENT MUST HAVE REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN OR WILL BE WITHHELD OR
                            WITHDRAWN. WE FEAR THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS
                            WOULD SO RESTRICT OPERATIONS OF MNCS AS TO REDUCE FLOW OF OVERSEAS
                            INVESTMENT WITH CONSEQUENT REDUCTIONS IN RATE OF DEVELOPMENT IN LDCS.
                            THE RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT WHICH EMERGED FROM THE SUMMER SESSION OF
                            THE 577H ECOSOC WAS MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TO OUR INTEREST THAN WE HAD
                            EXPECTED. OTHER POSTS SHOULD RAISE OUR "IF-ASKED" BASIS OR IF THEY
                            CONSIDER DISCUSSION THIS TOPIC PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.</p>

                            THE VERY SMALL STAFF OF UNDRO HAS BEEN A MAJOR CONSTRAINT ON ITS
                            PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES ASSIGNED BY GA. IN REVIEWING UNDRO ROLE AFTER THE
                            57TH ECOSOC (SUMMER 1974) WE PRESENTLY BELIEVE IT MOST PRACTICAL FOR
                            UNDRO TO CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPING A CLEARINGHOUSE OF INFORMATION FOR
                            THE MAJOR DONORS DURING THIS ROLE AND ABSENCE OF SUCH A CLEARINGHOUSE
                            HAS RESULTED IN WASTAGE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DURING RESPONSES TO LARGE
                            DISASTERS. PRIOR TO REACHING THIS CONCLUSION US CO-SPONSORED A
                            RESOLUTION AT 57TH ECOSOC REQUESTING SYG INVESTIGATE FEASIBILITY OF
                            MEASURES BEING TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN UNDRO AND REPORT TO 59TH ECOSOC
                            (SUMMER 1975). RESOLUTION ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT 29TH GA RECONSIDER SYG
                            REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF, WHICH 28TH GA DID NOT ACCEPT. WE BELIEVE
                            29TH GA SHOULD PROVIDE UNDRO WITH INCREASE IN STAFF AND WE WILL URGE
                            CONCENTRATION OF UNDRO EFFORTS ON DEVELOPING CLEARINGHOUSE CAPACITY.
                            WHEN UNDRO HAS DEVELOPED ITS COMPETENCE IN THIS AREA WE WOULD HOPE UNDRO
                            COULD TAKE ON PRE-DISASTER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING AND
                            COORDINATION OF DISASTER RELIEF RESPONSE BY UN ORGANIZATIONS. ALL POSTS

                            BIENNIAL PROGRAM BUDGET, COVERING THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD 1974-1975, IN AN
                            AMOUNT OF $540.5 MILLION. THIS REPRESENTED A BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE TWO
                            YEARS OF $270.2 MILLION. EARLY PROGNOSTICATIONS FOR F.Y. 1975 ARE THAT
                            THIS ALREADY APPROVED 1975 BUDGET COULD BE INCREASED AT THE COMING UNGA
                            BY AT LEAST $55 MILLION, INCLUDING $45 MILLION FOR INFLATION AND
                            CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS, GIVEN THE PROBABILITY OF THIS HUGE SUPPLEMENTAL
                            APPROPRIATION FOR THE 1974-1975 BIENNIAL BUDGET, WE BELIEVE MEMBER
                            STATES OUGHT TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO DEMAND FULL VALUE FOR THEIR
                            ASSESSMENT DOLLAR. WE HOPE, THEREFORE, THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTS WILL
                            INSTRUCT THEIR DELEGATIONS TO THE 29TH GA TO ASSURE THAT 1975
                            SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ARE (A) ESSENTIAL AND (B) MINIMAL.</p>

                            AND PROGRAMS. CONCERN HAS SHARPENED AS UN SYSTEM HAS UNDERGONE DRASTIC
                            CHANGES IN PAST TWO DECADES, RAISING EXPENDITURES OF ROUGHLY $500
                            MILLION ANNUALLY TEN YEARS AGO TO $1,400 MILLION ANNUALLY TODAY, WITH
                            APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT BEING DEVOTED TO ACTIVITIES IN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL
                            AND HUMAN RIGHTS FIELDS. ALTHOUGH SOME UN ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEVELOPING
                            TECHNIQUES AND MECHANISMS FOR CONDUCTING SUCH EVALUATIONS INTERNALLY, UN
                            FAMILY AS A WHOLE LACKS A FULLY DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE MECHANISM FOR

                            ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THEM. THE UNITED STATES WILL PROPOSE
                            AND SUPPORT MEASURES TO ESTABLISH A VIABLE EVALUATION MECHANISM FOR THE
                            UN SYSTEM. POSTS SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS VITAL IF THE RESOURCES
                            AND SKILLS CONTRIBUTED TO THE UN ARE TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY.</p>

                            (ICSAB) IS TO SUBMIT TO 29TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY A REPORT WITH
                            RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES OF STAFF IN
                            PROFESSIONAL AND HIGHER CATEGORIES OF UN COMMON SYSTEM, TO BE EFFECTIVE
                            JANUARY 1, 1975. RECOMMENDATIONS ICSAB WILL MAKE ARE NOT NOW KNOWN IN
                            DETAIL, BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT SALARY INCREASE OF SOME 6 PERCENT WILL BE
                            RECOMMENDED. SUCH AN INCREASE WOULD RESULT IN UN BASIC REMUNERATION
                            EXCEEDING CURRENT US CIVIL SERVICE SALARIES AT COMPARABLE LEVELS BY 31
                            PERCENT TO 48 PERCENT. U.S. OBJECTIVE IS TO PREVENT ANY INCREASE IN UN
                            SALARIES AT THIS TIME. POSTS MAY NOTE THAT CURRENT UN REMUNERATION (BASE
                            SALARY, SPOUSE ALLOWANCE, AND POST ADJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE) ALREADY EXCEEDS
                            COMPARABLE US CIVIL SERVICE SALARIES BY 24 TO 42 PERCENT. WE BELIEVE
                            BASIC REMUNERATION OF UN PERSONNEL SHOULD NOT EXCEED US CIVIL SERVICE
                            SALARIES BY MARGIN OF MORE THAN 15 PERCENT AND SHOULD BE COMPARED WITH
                            US CIVIC SERVICE PACKAGE OF SALARIES AND EMOLUMENTS IN ITS ENTIRETY.
                            CURRENT UN DEFICIT IS $90 MILLION. WITH NO CASH RESERVE ON HAN, POSTS
                            SHOULD URGE, UNLESS THERE OVERRIDING REASON FOR NOT DOING SO, THAT
                            FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION OF ICSAB PROPOSAL BE WITHHELD AND URGENT
                            ATTENTION GIVEN TO STEPS DESIGNED TO MAKE UN SOLVENT.</p>

                            OF UNGA, WOULD AUTHORIZE SECRETARY GENERAL TO APPOINT GROUP OF 20

                            Minister Bouteflika, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, New York</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I believe the Foreign Minister speaks English now.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I had fully intended to study English, but I was not
                            able to do so. I'm sure you realize that I was too busy and that I put
                            in many many hours attending to my duties.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: There were times we wished you would take some rest from
                            your duties. I spent a lot of time explaining to my colleagues that you
                            are a revolutionary by temperament not by official ideology like the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: This is a good way to put it; it's a good definition.
                            Perhaps age is also a factor. I have not yet reached the age of wisdom.
                            My rebel temperament also plays a part.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: As you know, I admire your President greatly. I missed you
                            very much when I was in Algiers. Being a man of principles, you're not
                            always easy to deal with but you're always interesting.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I'm very happy to have a chance to see you before my
                            departure. I was in Algiers recently and I explained to the President
                            that you and I had agreed on the timing for this visit at the end of the
                            session. I want to thank you for drawing attention to the fact that
                            January 9 was the approximate date of the Eigal-Allon visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We didn't want any embarrassments.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: We appreciate very much your attitude. We also wish to
                            avoid as much speculation as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Minister (Bouteflika): People would have said this is another of Dr.
                            K's tricks. So thank you for drawing our attention to this. When you
                            mentioned the schedule around Christmas or early next year, we knew that
                            you would not propose any visit during the holiday week and that it
                            would therefore be early next year. This is fine for me -- another
                            reason being that I would like our new ambassador to be in Washington
                            when I come.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Will you then come to Washington in January or
                            February?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bouteflika: Preferably February.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We will then entertain you and it will not be in the
                            context of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: In any event I made it quite clear that after December
                            18 I was completely free of the UNGA.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think mid-February is a good period.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Let me now tell you sore of my views of the 29th UNGA.
                            First of all let me assure you that in South Africa I was not behaving
                            like a naive choirboy but that I was acting quite deliberately. I remain
                            convinced that any decolonization contest is unwise at the time when
                            Rhodesia is beginning to think about the problem and when the Security
                            Council is unanimously voting a resolution on Namibia. Then the time has
                            come for the U.S. and the European countries with interests in South
                            Africa to begin a dialogue with the South African leaders. You cannot
                            pursue any longer a policy which is in disharmony with the rest of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>I feel that there can be no revolution if South Africa prepares public
                            opinion at home, and I feel that this can lead to three or four
                            different stages just as you have acted with respect to the Middle East.
                            There you had at first an all or nothing situation, but you opted for
                            the stage by stage approach; with South Africa we shall do the same.
                            Houphouet-Boigny began the dialogue between the African leaders and the
                            South African leaders and we do not encounter the same problem that we
                            encounter in setting up the dialogue with the Israelis. Israel faced the
                            problem of being considered a foreign body in the Middle East. </p>
                        <p>The expressions had been used of pushing Israel into the sea. But the
                            wise South Africans are full-fledged Africans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Except that they themselves don't think so.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: They do not think of themselves as Europeans. They
                            identify with what happens. As evidenced by the wonderful reception
                            extended to the Algerian delegation to the independence ceremony of
                            Swaziland when they stopped through Johannesburg on their way. The time
                            has come to think seriously about this and put it fully in the
                            agenda.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Let us plan to discuss this in great detail when you come
                            to Washington in February. In principle, I am interested, but this must
                            be discussed with great discretion.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Yes, discretion is necessary. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It is essential.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: At this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> we gave a
                            clear warning, and this may help <persName corresp="#p_SID1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> of Rhodesia to implement constitutional changes.
                            Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CLJ1">Callaghan</persName> was
                            interested in constitutional changes. I found him very honest when he
                            talked to me about this. And Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WJH2"
                                >Wilson</persName> was also very honest about this. At the time of
                            the Kaunda Mission to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> then PM
                                <persName corresp="#p_HERG1">Heath</persName> was very unreceptive
                            but Wilson was very open to the idea and remains very open minded and
                            receptive today. </p>
                        <p>The second question I want to discuss with you is the Palestinian issue.
                            I remain convinced that at the GA we have given you one more trump card
                            to help you tell the Israelis that you are with them all the way. </p>
                        <p>I scrutinized minutely the behavior of your delegation at the time of the
                            inscription of the Palestinian issue on the agenda. I told de <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGL1">Guiringaud</persName> that the U.S. preferred to
                            see this question discussed in committee, not at the GA. But was it not
                            the best way to tame the Palestinians by letting this question be
                            discussed at the GA? In this connection I omitted to say yesterday in my
                            press conference that I intend to say this. The U.S. deserves a very
                            special tribute. I have never seen them move so selflessly and sincerely
                            round the clock as they did then. They're a wonderful team and they knew
                            that the prestige of the U.S. was at stake.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They were under very strict instructions.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: They were wonderful and I have asked the Palestinians to
                            write to them telling them how grateful they are. Now I am going to talk
                            to you about Cambodia and I'm asking you not to become impatient with
                            me.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I can never become impatient with you because I consider
                            you my friend and I do want to talk to you about Cambodia and Cuba and I
                            also want to talk to you privately about the Palestinians, this is why I
                            did not want to spend too much time about South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: At the time of the vote on the Cambodia resolution this
                            was the first time that the press said that the President of the UNGA
                            had acted with full objectivity. I watched from the podium and I helped
                            your resolution pass. I sensed that the atmosphere was becoming heavy.
                            There is a tendency in the press to present as a defeat to the U.S.
                            something which is nothing of the kind. Was South Africa a defeat to the
                            U.S.? You speak about the Palestinians and the press distorts this as if
                            it were a defeat to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: There are more Jewish journalists in New York than there
                            are Arab ones.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I have met Jews and Zionist Jews in New York. Some of
                            them are very very lucid. They know the terms of the problem and there
                            cannot be a settlement without the Palestinians and they want to try to
                            work out a settlement with the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I believe you and I agree.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: The resolution did not pass because Egypt, co-author of
                            the resolution, remained absent, even though its delegation numbers
                            fifty. The story I got was that the car bringing the delegate to the
                            vote broke down, the votes took about six hours but the car remained out
                            of service during that time. Morocco which recognized <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> voted for the other
                            resolution; Tunisia which recognizes Sihanouk abstained; the emirates
                            and Bahrain who also recognized Sihanouk abstained. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJM3">Baroody</persName>, who is very skillful offered
                            amendments to the two resolutions but no one takes him seriously. If
                            other groups had negotiated seriously with Baroody, the result of the
                            vote would have been different.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: You are right.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Baroody's getting old and as men grow older their
                            sensitivities increase. I first observed this when I met General
                            DeGaulle for the first time. Even an outstanding man like him is not
                            immune to that rile.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It is a painful phenomenon to observe.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: The first time I met DeGaulle I observed how age had
                            eroded him. How susceptible he had become to flattery and to his
                            sensitivities. The Thai Ambassador who is young, skillful and
                            intelligent used a moment of inattention to introduce an amendment which
                            changed the substance of the resolution. Any delegation could have then
                            invoked the 24-hour rule because of the change in the substance of the
                            resolution but no one did. He acted very fast and I like him for it.
                            Then the Ambassador of Sri Lanka got the point but no one understood.
                            The bold move of the Thai ambassador appealed to me. He made his move
                            very fast and he won. No one realized what was going on. We voted 56-54
                            and the resolution passed which is what I wanted. I point to your
                            attention this 56-54 result. If it had been 55-55, the resolution would
                            have come to a vote a second time then it would have been rejected and
                            so you won your vote by one vote. This leads me to the conclusion that
                            you have until the beginning of the next GA to settle that question. The
                            resolution speaks of two parties Sihanouk and <persName corresp="#p_LN2"
                                >Lon Nol</persName> which it places on an equal footing. At the 27th
                            GA the Handbro legal opinion on South Africa said and I quote: "Any
                            delegation can be suspended when there are two parties recognized by the
                            GA." At the next GA Sihanouk will send letters of accreditation and the
                            credentials committee will be in an untenable position. Believe me I
                            speak to you as a friend.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well we have spoken about this in the past. We are not
                            opposed to Sihanouk playing in Cambodia the kind of role that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has played in Laos. We
                            are looking for a way to talk to Sihanouk but haven't yet found one. Of
                            course it would help if he would restrain his eloquence for a few weeks,
                            but this is a minor point.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: The fact that he does not restrain his eloquence is not
                            a disservice to you because it annoys some of his supporters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The fact is how can we have a serious exchange with
                            Sihanouk.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Without appearing to work at cross purposes with you I
                            want to invite their Defense Minister to Algiers. He is the Deputy Prime
                            Minister and head of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What's his name? Could Ambassador Parker talk to him
                            quietly?</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I do not recall his name but I always feel that those in
                            power are more reasonable than those who are not. And I want to talk to
                            him without Sihanouk to see what are the limits of the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But you can tell him the U.S. has no national interest in
                            Cambodia. We want to end the war in a way that our national dignity is
                            preserved. We do not seek a permanent position in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I simply draw your attention to the fact that you have
                            eight months to try to solve the problem because at the next GA you will
                            have a very bad situation on your hands. Now on Korea, even at the
                            Security Council among the five permanent members there begins to be the
                            feeling that there is no reason for the UN flag to be there. The US can
                            have a defense pact with any nation and keep troops in South Korea if it
                            wished but as a US, not UN, proposition.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This is possible.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: It would be better if the idea came from you than if it
                            came from the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We can do that.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Buffum: I think we can work out an arrangement with the parties and
                            notify the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do you think North Korea will agree?</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Even if it doesn't it does not matter since you do not
                            have relations with them now. Let me now speak to the revolutionary
                            spirit in you. If you have an opportunity to meet Kim Il Song you should
                            do so. In my view in the Third world there were Cuba, Algeria, Vietnam
                            and Korea each trying to set up an independent national policy. Cuba
                            cannot do so until it has normalized its relations with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I fully agree with you.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Cuba is like a patient with one lung, who cannot take a
                            deep breath until it has healed. Algeria has a long history with France
                            and Europe and progress will take time. The policy of independence is
                            costly. Something or other is always coming up. Vietnam has been forced
                            by war to choose a policy of balance between Moscow and Peking, leaning
                            to either Peking or Moscow as one or the other shows greater reluctance.
                            The only country with truly a policy of national independence is North
                            Korea. I asked Kim Il Song why he did not rejoin the nonaligned group,
                            pointing out to him that after all countries like Cuba and Yugoslavia
                            are in it. He told me he had never thought about it. I pointed out to
                            him that he has defense pacts with the Soviet Union and Peking. He said
                            if Seoul renounces its defense pacts with the U.S. and Japan within 24
                            hours he will renounce his with Moscow and Peking. You won't be sorry to
                            talk to Kim Il Song. I told him that. I had read his works and I see
                            that he encourages the cult of personality, having himself described as
                            the beloved leader of forty million North Koreans. He pointed out the
                            need for the Korean people to have someone with whom they can identify
                            as a national figure because in neighboring China there is one God who
                            is Mao and he wanted the Koreans to feel they did not have to seek
                            outside their own borders for a national figure.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This is very important.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: You will understand them better after talking to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We had thought we would wait until after the GA.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: I know Kim Il Song is the most open of all the North
                            Korean leaders. The one who will find compromise, the others are just
                            like students with a master. You must try to get his personal views. At
                            this GA we voted on the economic charter but you must not take that too
                            seriously. We voted also on the revision of the San Francisco charter
                            but this is a very long process. Ambassador Malik asked me how come the
                            name of Algeria appeared alongside the names of Colombia and the
                            Philippines and Brazil. I told him Algeria belongs to the non-aligned
                            world, that we are not Communists. Eleven years ago <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had told me that I was dogmatic
                            with respect to the Charter. How can we accept today references to
                            Germany and Japan as enemy states when they are both active in the
                            organization. How can we accept provisions on trusteeship when
                            decolonization is a reality. No one challenges the right of veto.
                            Actually a correct analysis would demonstrate that only two countries
                            should have a veto power. I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings, but
                            there are only two superpowers in the world today, and they in fact have
                            an actual veto power. The more dogmatic the Soviets show themselves the
                            more flexible you should be and observe the situation without
                            challenging the tide of the third world. You must understand that the
                            third world does not wish to be Communist; the Chinese have understood
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I have understood that. The Third World is torn between
                            rhetoric and cooperation. On the one hand they argue politically with
                            the industrialized world, on the other they seek economic cooperation.
                            This dilemma won't work. In the special session next September we have
                            an obligation to attempt to solve the problem. I agree with your
                            President 100 percent. We must be cooperative. In bilateral terms, this
                            makes no difference at all because the U.S. continues to be a strong
                            country. However, Europe and Japan are no longer that strong. The U.S.
                            cannot have the Third World demoralizing Japan and Europe. You
                            understand I am talking to you now as an old friend and also as a leader
                            of the Third World. If we can work together during this special session
                            it must become a symbol of the cooperation between us then we can do
                            much. If it becomes a session of confrontation, then that worries me
                            greatly.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: It would never be a confrontation. We have also ended on
                            a conciliatory note. When we voted on the rearrangement of the economic
                            order, we voted ideas freely. The UN can be a democratic forum where
                            small countries are not afraid to hurt the feelings of big nations. The
                            US is a house of freedom. What we seek is not the result of
                            confrontation hut of a dialogue and of consultation. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName> said you would not
                            become a member of the Council of Governors (of the special fund)
                            because you would not belong to it since you had chosen the path of
                            bilateral cooperation. This was a very honest statement. Your country
                            can do what it chooses bilaterally and incidentally I certainly hope
                            that Algeria will be one of the countries with which you pursue
                            bilateral assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Absolutely, you must have no doubt about that.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: President Boumedienne has said if you have ten billion
                            dollars or 20 billion dollars available, we shall need them for our own
                            development. But here with the special fund you can made a political
                            investment to assist the drought stricken countries or can give aid to
                            the newly independent nations. Nations remember those who aided them
                            first. I would advise you to make a token contribution to the special
                            fund because being away altogether is not good for you.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This is something that I want to discuss with my
                            associates.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: A country with your power has in this instance given the
                            impression that it was annoyed, angry. You should not remain absent
                            completely. If you are present within the fund you can help give it a
                            certain direction, but if you are absent, you're always in the wrong.
                            Besides, you can still retain your bilateral relations because you can
                            earmark up to one-half or possibly two-thirds of your contribution to
                            bilateral recipients.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Buffum: The argument was not so much earmarking a share of one's
                            contribution for bilateral recipients as it was using existing
                            organizations rather than setting up new competing bodies, your
                            President had told <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that
                            the World Bank would be acceptable as a channel. A lot of things remain
                            unclear.</p>
                        <p>Min. Bouteflika: Yes, a lot of points I never made clear in advance but
                            are subsequently cleared up in practice. I will get back by you, Mr.
                            Secretary, in due time on all these points.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: You have given me much food for thought and reflection. I
                            plan a speech about the UN where I will combine being critical and being
                            constructive.</p>

                        <p>Actions we are Taking Regarding International Organizations in the United
                            Nations System</p>
                        <p>We have begun to take a hard look at the entire <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> system in the light of our experiences in the last year.
                            This memorandum describes briefly the main elements of the overall
                            problem, our principal working objectives and the main actions we are
                            taking during the coming year which we hope will help to counter recent
                            unfavorable trends and even permit us to make some gains.</p>
                        <p>I. The Problem</p>
                        <p>Our overall problem has two broad and interrelated dimensions:</p>
                        <p>First, we face the largely operational side which is that of identifying
                            those aspects of the UN system which provide significant and concrete
                            benefits to us and devising the most practical means of protecting and
                            strengthening them.</p>
                        <p>Second, we have the more conceptual and longer range part of the problem
                            which is that of further developing our ideas about how interdependence
                            should work, translating our concepts into practical initiatives, and
                            generally trying to gain greater real acceptance among governments and
                            within international organizations for doing business on the basis of
                            genuine consensus.</p>
                        <p>The problem is an extremely complex one, both because there are so many
                            disparate institutions carrying out such a wide variety of endeavors and
                            also because of the complex political relationships which operate
                            between various countries and groups of countries in and outside the UN.
                            There is clearly no single panacea.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, limitations on our ability to control events in
                            multilateral institutions. In the handling of multilateral issues at the
                            UN, there is an inherent distortion in comparison with the handling of
                            issues bilaterally. Outside the UN, countries know that the weight given
                            their views will to a considerable extent depend on the significance of
                            their actual role in the activities in question. However, in the General
                            Assembly, as well as the comparable bodies of the specialized agencies,
                            the appearance of equality through the rule of one-country-one-vote and
                            the ability of countries with little real influence in the world to
                            combine their voting strength leads to a certain unreality. We cannot
                            realistically hope to change the basic situation since the present
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>/non-aligned majority will not
                            voluntarily agree to basic changes in the rules which lessen its
                            parliamentary power.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I should note that all of our efforts must be viewed with the
                            realization that we are working with essentially innovative concepts.
                            The idea of interdependence and its application to practical affairs is
                            really quite a recent development. As you pointed out in your interview
                            with Bill Moyers, many of the new countries we must work with formed
                            their identity in opposition to the industrial countries. For the LDCs,
                            therefore, it will, at best, be a gradual process for many of them to
                            shift away from the habit of confrontation toward greater practice of
                            interdependence, and we will certainly have to expect a great many ups
                            and downs.</p>
                        <p>II. Objectives </p>
                        <p>The following appear to be the most important working objectives:</p>
                        <p>(1) Protect and strengthen the effectiveness and responsibility of the
                            Security Council in dealing with crisis situations, including
                            particularly maintaining or organizing necessary peacekeeping
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>(2) Pursue projects reflecting our view of interdependence with respect
                            to topics of interest to us, like world food problems, promotion of
                            effective nuclear safeguards, population control.</p>
                        <p>(3) Work to protect specialized agencies from political confrontation
                            extraneous to the technical, economic and social missions which these
                            agencies were designed to serve and, to the extent possible, work to
                            increase the efficiency of the agencies in doing their jobs.</p>
                        <p>(4) Endeavor to increase the willingness of LDC and non-aligned countries
                            to consider UN issues on their individual merits and not to pursue
                            pre-cooked bloc positions. Our objective with the non-aligned/LDCs add
                            up, I believe, to the basic task of showing convincingly to a sufficient
                            number of these countries that concentration on activities where genuine
                            consensus can be built offers the greatest promise of tangible benefits.
                            Conversely, we should continue to stress, as you have been doing, that
                            pursuit of confrontation politics within the UN system will cause a
                            basic weakening of the system, including a risk of gradual
                            disassociation from parts of it by the United States. In other words, we
                            must try to find ways of making others realize more clearly that they
                            cannot harass us in international institutions while getting cooperation
                            from us on matters of interest to them.</p>
                        <p>(5) Work for practical improvements in the practices and rules of
                            procedures applicable in deliberative bodies like the General Assembly
                            and in international conferences held under UN auspices. While
                            improvements in practices and procedures will not eliminate the basic
                            difficulties with which we are confronted, they could lessen to some
                            extent the distortion factors which prejudice productive work in a
                            multilateral setting.</p>
                        <p>III. Actions we are taking </p>
                        <p>(1) Peacekeeping guidelines. Since your initiative at the 1973 <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> in favor of establishing general
                            guidelines, there have been fairly extensive and complex negotiations
                            within the UN's Committee of 33 on peacekeeping. For example,
                            documentation has been prepared which sets forth two and in many cases
                            three alternate versions of many guidelines. We will conduct a
                            systematic review of the various issues in order to ascertain whether
                            there are new ideas we can put forward which would reinvigorate the
                            negotiations. Of most importance, however, we need to take stock of
                            whether and how we can practically encourage movement on the Soviet
                            side.</p>
                        <p>(2) Preparation for the Seventh Special Session. Since the Session is
                            eight months away, we have an opportunity for comprehensive, substantive
                            preparations which contrasts very favorably with the extremely rushed
                            and difficult situation that faced us prior to the Sixth Special
                            Session. We have found generally that when the US has a concrete and
                            well thought-through program, as in the case of the World Food
                            Conference, not only is our influence greater, but the outcome is more
                            satisfactory from our standpoint.</p>
                        <p>For us to be effective it is not essential to propose greater roles for
                            UN agencies or more expenditure of UN funds. What does seem essential is
                            that we have comprehensive and convincing positions on how we believe
                            the serious and growing economic problems of the world can best be
                            managed. With economic contraction likely to be the prevalent state of
                            affairs next year for both developed and developing countries, there
                            ought, logically, to exist some increment of sobriety in the attitudes
                            many countries bring to these discussions. Assuming we pursue a serious
                            effort of preparation, we can properly regard the Seventh Special
                            Session as something of a test case as to whether the General Assembly
                            can carry out responsible work in the field of world economic
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>IO will cooperate closely with other bureaus and representatives of other
                            agencies. The problems which will be discussed at the Seventh Special
                            Session touch upon pretty nearly the whole spectrum of international
                            economic issues. What we do at the UN must therefore fit within the
                            framework of our broad worldwide economic strategy. In this connection,
                            we should focus principally on three areas. First, possible initiatives
                            which would advance our overall worldwide economic interests. This could
                            include proposed actions which could be pursued inside or outside of the
                            UN system and which could serve both to reinforce our leadership and to
                            supplant proposals we consider unsound. Second, proposals to strengthen
                            the UN's effectiveness in its traditional role of providing technical
                            and development assistance. Third, new suggestions to meet the critical
                            needs of the countries hardest hit by the world economic crisis.</p>
                        <p>A related project, which I should like to report to you, is that IO and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have agreed to conduct a joint
                            study of what would be the most advantageous mix, from the standpoint of
                            U.S. interests, between bilateral and multilateral assistance programs.
                            No such review has been carried out in the recent past, and it is
                            possible that, as a result, we will be presenting to you specific
                            recommendations which would have a bearing on our approach to the
                            development role of the United Nations, one of the key issues for the
                            Seventh Special Session.</p>
                        <p>(3) Protection and improvement of the specialized agencies. We have
                            already begun a comprehensive review of the problems confronting the
                            different specialized agencies and the possible tactics which might be
                            most successful to arrest deterioration and to increase chances of being
                            able to handle new challenges successfully.</p>
                        <p>The basic factors relevant in the different agencies vary widely,
                            including: the assigned tasks; the strengths and weaknesses within the
                            different agencies; their vulnerabilities to political campaigns; and
                            our own assets in dealing with challenges. For example, in some agencies
                            there are strong, technically oriented secretariats which consult with
                            and accept advice from American delegations. In these situations, we can
                            plan to make maximum use of friendly secretariats who want to get on
                            with their essential tasks. In other secretariats, there has been a long
                            record of stultifying inefficiency or non-aligned manipulation and
                            therefore our opportunities for management through this channel are
                            extremely limited. Unavoidably, we will not be able to count on any
                            single tactic for improving the basic work of each agency. Rather, we
                            will need to develop a repertoire of approaches which we can draw upon
                            in differing situations.</p>
                        <p>To begin discussions among friendly developed countries, to encourage
                            greater efforts on their part, and to exchange basic ideas, I am
                            attending from February 4 to 6 the annual Geneva Group consultations
                            consisting of leading Western contributors to the UN system.</p>
                        <p>(4) Evaluation within the UN system. A UN committee will begin to meet
                            this spring to consider proposals for strengthening the UN's machinery
                            for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of UN programs. There
                            are, in fact, many areas in which the UN's operations are wasteful, and
                            we have already developed some specific ideas for improving inspection
                            and evaluation.</p>
                        <p>The issues are not basically confrontational with the LDCs because, if
                            programs can be made significantly more efficient, the benefits should
                            be more substantial for LDCs who are the principal recipients of UN
                            assistance. We intend to coordinate our efforts with like-minded
                            developed countries and then to broaden consultations to include leading
                            LDCs.</p>
                        <p>(5) U.S. participation in the new UN committee on revision of the Charter
                            and UN procedures. At the 29th UNGA, a committee, on which we expect to
                            serve, was established to consider proposals for amending the UN
                            Charter, as well as possible improvements in the UN's practices and
                            procedures not involving Charter amendments. We intend to discourage
                            Charter revision. This is bound to be a defensive operation for us
                            because we know that some countries plan to agitate for elimination of
                            the veto power in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>It may be possible, however, to develop practical proposals for changes
                            in the UN's practices and procedures which are not regarded by the
                            non-aligned as an attempt by us to emasculate their parliamentary
                            strength and which would improve the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>'s
                            ability to deal with agenda items. The new committee will not meet until
                            July; however, we are beginning the study of possible proposals now,
                            together with other interested bureaus, so that we can have adequate
                            time to coordinate with our friends and to insure that we have ideas of
                            our own to put before the first session.</p>
                        <p>(6) U.S. participation in international conferences. Many international
                            conferences, not related to a regular schedule of board or assembly
                            meetings, take place under the UN system for a variety of purposes
                            throughout each year. In parallel with the increasing politicization we
                            have seen in specialized agencies, there has also been a growing
                            tendency by the non-aligned/LDCs to use these special conferences for
                            confrontation and to pursue extraneous political purposes. It is
                            desirable to begin more extensive advance planning on how we can resist
                            situations likely to be stacked against us. We have also found that the
                            location of conferences can significantly affect how fair the
                            proceedings are. For example, our embassy in Mexico City has reported a
                            serious deterioration in the impartiality of Mexican host country
                            chairmen at many conferences, even to the point where U.S. and other
                            Western delegations are often prevented from fully expressing their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>It may, therefore, be desirable for us to take much tougher stance early
                            in the process of deciding on conference arrangements, including the
                            possibility of saying that we will not at tend some conferences if they
                            take place in certain locations or unless and until there has been
                            satisfactory prior agreement on essential procedural questions. IO will
                            begin a study of the detailed possibilities.</p>
                        <p>(7) Intensified diplomatic efforts with LDCs/non-aligned. During the last
                            UNGA significant defections from non-aligned ranks took place on some
                            issues. A monolithic, non-aligned bloc was not maintained regarding
                            either the Cambodian or the Korean issues. It is in our interest to
                            follow up in capitals throughout the year, not just during General
                            Assembly sessions, and IO will prepare the instructions for doing this.
                            Our diplomatic efforts should comprehend discussions not only of
                            political issues but UN economic issues as well.</p>
                        <p>(8) Selective withdrawal from UN activities. By disassociating ourselves
                            from activities or projects we did not support and which we do not think
                            can have sound and practical results, we may be able to show others over
                            a period of time that there is little practical future for activities
                            which are not based on genuine consensus. We have in the past often
                            participated for damage limiting purposes in bodies or groups we have
                            not favored. However, if an enterprise is fundamentally unsound in our
                            judgment, we might in some cases be less concerned with the results,
                            assuming that we are prepared to disregard them.</p>
                        <p>There is a broad spectrum of situations to which non-participation might
                            apply, e.g., non-participation in consideration of, or voting on,
                            particular items before the UNGA or its principal committees;
                            non-participation in ad hoc UNGA subcommittees (like the Committee of 24
                            on colonial issues); non-participation in particular sessions of UN
                            bodies (like a special session of the GA); non-participation in
                            principal UN organs (like <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>). We
                            have already engaged in some non-participation in the case of a few UN
                            sub-bodies.</p>
                        <p>A form of non-participation we have not previously utilized is that of
                            declining to participate in the adoption of a measure, that is, even
                            declining to cast an abstention. This option might be useful
                            particularly as a way of showing disapproval with the manner in which an
                            item was handled, e.g., without sufficient consultations, with
                            unjustified haste, or the like.</p>
                        <p>It is our judgment that until such time as there is substantial
                            improvement in the overall functioning-of the UN system, there are
                            likely to be situations in which some form of non-participation would be
                            helpful to our overall efforts and that several instances of
                            non-participation by us would gradually and cumulatively stimulate
                            others to a more realistic appreciation of the long-term dangers of
                            pursuing confrontation politics in international organizations.
                            Accordingly, we intend to look carefully throughout the year's work at
                            developing situations to see whenever some form of non-participation
                            might be appropriate and we may present this option to you for
                            consideration more frequently than in the past.</p>
                        <p>(9) Selective withholding of contributions to the UN or its specialized
                            agencies. There are three possible types of withholding. First, we could
                            withhold for expenditures which we think were illegally or improperly
                            authorized. Second, we could withhold from an entire organization if we
                            believe its activities have been grossly irresponsible. This type of
                            withholding has taken place only as a result of decisions by Congress,
                            e.g., UNESCO and earlier with the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>.
                            Third, we could withhold contributions relating to individual
                            resolutions or decisions of which we strongly disapprove.</p>
                        <p>An advantage to selective withholding could be that it could provide even
                            stronger evidence than selective non-participation that the U.S. will
                            not accept serious abuses within the system. On the negative side,
                            however, withholding would obviously raise difficult policy issues and
                            could involve legal questions about treaty obligations to pay assessed
                            contributions. Our withholdings could be utilized to justify widespread
                            withholdings by others, with a significant decrease resulting in the
                            overall effectiveness of the UN and its bodies, including possibly in
                            areas where we are deriving benefit. It would be relatively easy for
                            some of the newly rich countries to pick up the deficits when they
                            wished to, thus minimizing the practical impact of our withholding and
                            even perhaps setting the stage for more irresponsible activities than
                            before. At the present time we do not see situations which would warrant
                            our taking the initiative to withhold funds. However, we shall keep this
                            option in mind as the year's work proceeds and will call to your
                            attention any situations that might warrant its consideration.</p>

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> opened its 29th General Assembly, a
                            session which was to become one of the most tumultuous and publicized of
                            recent years. That study offered several judgments concerning the
                            problems of a UN increasingly hostile to US policies:</p>
                        <p>-- The UN, which reflects far more than it influences the basic trends in
                            world politics, only mirrors the fundamental conflicts in interests and
                            ideologies between less developed countries (LDCs) and industrialized
                            states.</p>
                        <p>-- As the wealthiest state in a forum dominated by a cohesive <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> majority, the US is unavoidably the
                            chief target of their substantive and ideological grievances.</p>
                        <p>-- The benefits derived by the US from the operations of the Security
                            Council and the specialized agencies have served to counterbalance the
                            liabilities of repeated diplomatic defeats in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>While the performance of the 29th General Assembly has not altered these
                            assessments, it has indicated a new development that may increase the
                            problems and erode the remaining potential of the UN.</p>
                        <p>LDCs appear to be altering their primary objectives from seeking
                            financial and technical assistance to seeking fundamental revisions of
                            international practices and institutions.</p>
                        <p>These demands are potentially far more threatening to the interests of
                            Western powers than the demands for aid which have dominated LDC
                            activities for the past decade. Like the more traditional LDC
                            activities, the pressures for revision originate in and are governed by
                            developments outside the UN. If general relations between the US and the
                            LDCs were to continue to deteriorate, the revisionist efforts could soon
                            undercut the residual benefits the US derives from the Security Council
                            and the specialized agencies.</p>
                        <p>Ingredients: Two Old, One New</p>
                        <p>The 1974 General Assembly drew unaccustomed governmental and public
                            scrutiny to the UN. By the close of the ten-week session, Yasir Arafat
                            had addressed the Assembly, Israel had been muzzled in open debate,
                            South Africa had been suspended, and expropriation of foreign
                            investments had been sanctified. LDCs achieved each of these victories
                            by applying their two-thirds majority with considerable efficiency and
                            little restraint. As LDC victories accumulated, Western industrialized
                            members -- not quite resigned to the role of automatic minority --
                            became increasingly restive. Western representatives suggested that the
                            Assembly, under such circumstances, had little utility for their
                            governments. A growing sense of institutional crisis transformed the
                            Assembly's closing agenda item, "strengthening the organization," into
                            an exchange of grievances. For three days delegates of industrial and
                            developing states joined in a dialogue in which the UN became a metaphor
                            for their mutually unsatisfactory relations.</p>
                        <p>Despite the rhetoric and the drama, little that was new or unexpected
                            occurred during the session; familiar problems merely continued to erode
                            the potential of the organization. The Assembly had reflected, and would
                            continue to reflect, the clashes of interests and ideologies between the
                            LDCs and the industrial states of the West; the Assembly remained at
                            most a well-publicized site of battle, at least a small side show of
                            global antagonisms. The industrialized communist countries also face
                            increasing conflicts of interest with LDCs. The communist states do not,
                            however, face as many ideological stresses in their LDC relations as
                            does the West, and they have worked hard to maintain the appearance of
                            cooperation with LDCs in UN diplomacy. In the 29th Assembly, both China
                            and the European communist states assumed generally passive postures on
                            LDC issues, often abstaining or giving token consent to policies which
                            they expected to have few reverberations beyond UN halls.</p>
                        <p>The 29th Assembly, therefore, sustained the pattern of LDC control which
                            has marked UN politics for over a decade -- a pattern which has
                            transformed the UN from a forum that readily supported US Cold War
                            policies to an arena which now just as readily castigates US postures on
                            global issues. So long as the antagonism between developing countries
                            and industrialized states continues in the world outside, the
                            confrontations in the General Assembly -- and Washington's embattled
                            position there -- are unlikely to change.</p>
                        <p>The Assembly's recycling of familiar issues provoked unusual political
                            responses because its proceedings were embellished by high visibility,
                            particularly well-managed LDC solidarity, and a shift of emphasis in LDC
                            objectives.* While each of these factors helps to explain the atmosphere
                            of the 1974 General Assembly, only the last represents a newly
                            significant development.</p>
                        <p>* The LDC caucusing group in the UN is still called the "Group of 77"
                            although its membership has expanded over 100 Latin American, African,
                            Asian, and Oceania countries. With the increase in size has also come an
                            increase in diversity. During this session one of the most important
                            internal divisions was between oil-wealthy Arab states and their less
                            fortunate allies, many of whom, such as India, were more severely
                            affected by soaring oil prices than Western states. Outside of the UN,
                            the primary organization of LDC solidarity is the non-aligned movement.
                            The non-aligned movement has a smaller membership -- approximately 80
                            states -- and is generally considered to be more radical than the "Group
                            of 77."</p>
                        <p>High Visibility: This session sparked unusually strong reactions to
                            essentially predictable tendencies because its proceedings were highly
                            dramatic and therefore well publicized. The decision to include the
                            Palestine Liberation Organization in the annual Middle East debate was
                            largely a reflection by the UN of an accomplished fact: Arab support for
                            the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> at Rabat had established the
                            group's claim for a voice in Middle East negotiations. Nor was Arafat
                            the first non-member to address the Assembly, although his status as a
                            guerrilla leader and the tension surrounding his presence in New York
                            City assured his appearance at the UN much greater notice than Pope
                            Paul's in 1965.</p>
                        <p>Algerian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName>'s rulings from the president's chair were
                            frequently arbitrary and calculated to LDC advantage.* His restriction
                            of Israeli rights of reply in the Middle East debate stimulated
                            particularly strong public reactions. As disturbing as such acts were,
                            however, they were only illustrations of the established fact of LDC
                            dominance in the Assembly. Bouteflika's rulings were more demonstrations
                            of the latitude permitted an officer supported by two-thirds of the
                            membership than a significant increment in LDC influence in the
                            Assembly. A president without such a secure position in the LDC caucus
                            could have been voted down on points of order when his rulings went
                            beyond precedent and common practice. When Poland held the presidency in
                            1972, Ambassador Trepczynski also enjoyed solid LDC backing and
                            stretched the standards of parliamentary procedures with only slightly
                            less bravado and notoriety.</p>
                        <p>* A new assembly president is elected for each session. In practice, the
                            presidency has been rotated among regional groups. A president's powers
                            include according the right to speak, ruling on points of order,
                            limiting speaking time, and closing debate (Rules of Procedure of the
                            General Assembly, rule 35). In exercising such prerogatives, however,
                            the president remains under the authority of the General Assembly (rule
                            36).</p>
                        <p>LDC Solidarity: The increased impact of LDC cooperation in the Assembly
                            was more the result of better parliamentary management than of an actual
                            growth in political cohesion. The twin victories of the PLO invitation
                            and the South African suspension were, for example, the result of a
                            basic quid pro quo exchange of support among African and Arab members.
                            Carefully orchestrated by Tanzanian Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSA1">Salim</persName>, these votes were the product of
                            long preparation, not of an automatic majority. The Korean and Cambodian
                            votes -- two issues of strong US interest -- provide a sharp contrast.
                            US policies carried, despite formal opposition by the LDC caucus. The
                            Asian LDC countries most concerned did not mount a lobbying campaign
                            strong enough to convince members from other regions that these
                            essentially East-West confrontations were issues of vital importance to
                            the LDC cause.**</p>
                        <p>** The perennial Korean and Cambodian agenda items have, in fact, become
                            anachronisms; they are essentially questions of East-West confrontation
                            in an Assembly which is increasingly tuned only to LDC concerns. The
                            Korean question again centered on whether foreign troops and the UN
                            Command should remain in Korea. Communist states have strongly opposed
                            the continuation of this vestige of the Korean peacekeeping operation
                            under whose flag US troops remain in Korea. The Cambodian question --
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s challenge to
                            the Khmer government's right to represent Cambodia -- is essentially a
                            credentials issue. The Communist positions narrowly failed to carry on
                            both questions.</p>
                        <p>Shift in LDC Objectives: During the 29th General Assembly, LDCs appeared
                            to shift the priority of their efforts from economic and technical aid
                            to fundamental revisions of international institutions and the patterns
                            of diplomatic and commercial exchanges in order to gain "sovereign
                            equality" with industrialized powers. This shift in emphasis from the
                            aid programs which dominated their concerns for the past decade to
                            redistribution of authority represents a second dimension of the LDC
                            movement -- a dimension which is potentially more disruptive to US
                            interests as well as to UN operations. While efforts to make
                            international arrangements more favorable to their interests have been
                            of growing importance in the LDCs' activities for some time, the 29th
                            Assembly may mark the point at which such goals became their major
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>The timing is most likely the result of developments outside of the UN
                            during 1974: the oil embargo and economic dislocations in the industrial
                            world. The embargo and oil price revisions provided a dramatic example
                            of success in changing established practices and in redistributing
                            power. Whether or not the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> model is
                            a realistic example for other LDC groups, it has given them greater
                            self-confidence to contemplate such challenges to the industrialized
                            world and its ordained institutions. The recessions and severe inflation
                            which have weakened Western economies have also presented a new and
                            disturbing possibility to the LDCs: the West may no longer be able to
                            provide much financial assistance. This perception reinforces the logic
                            of demanding better terms on which to compete with the West rather than
                            relying primarily on aid programs whose effectiveness many LDCs now
                            question; it also implies less reason for cooperating with Western
                            powers. Because the economic dislocations have been international as
                            well as domestic, LDC attention has also been focused on updating the
                            global economic institutions imposed by the industrial powers after
                            World War II. Many LDCs feel that they are demanding not concessions but
                            only recognition of fundamental changes -- reduction of Western power
                            and growth of LDC influence -- which are already taking place in
                            international politics.</p>
                        <p>The tumultuous atmosphere of the 29th General Assembly should, in part,
                            be attributed to this growing uncertainty in international standards.
                            The Assembly's debates took place in an international environment in
                            which there are few shared ideals, common perceptions of danger, or
                            accepted rules of the game. Each group struggles to insure that
                            anticipated new rules will be drawn up to favor its interests. The
                            result is confusion, and confusion encourages those striving to alter
                            the status quo.</p>
                        <p>Approval of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties was the clearest
                            indicator of the shift in LDC priorities.* An encore to last spring's
                            special session on raw materials, the Charter was approved despite two
                            years of determined Western opposition. It was carried by 120 out of 136
                            votes: full LDC and Communist support with Western members opposing or
                            abstaining.</p>
                        <p>* The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States was proposed in the
                            May 1972 session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
                            Development. <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> then created a
                            40-member working group, to "establish generally accepted norms to
                            govern international economic relations," which drafted the Charter.
                            Mexico's President <persName corresp="#p_EAL1">Echeverria</persName>
                            became closely identified with the Charter and accepted its approval as
                            a personal victory in his campaign to extend his influence as an LDC
                            leader. Considering the sharp rivalries among LDC leaders, it is not
                            surprising that some other LDC spokesmen have unofficially expressed
                            ambivalence towards the Charter and Mexico's position in the
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>The Economic Charter postulates revisions of international trade and
                            business practices. Its most important section, Article II, sanctifies
                            the right to "nationalize, expropriate, or transfer ownership of foreign
                            property" without the international safeguards of full and fair
                            compensation so long demanded by the West. The Charter also declares the
                            right of all states to participate in international decision-making
                            concerning economic, financial, and monetary problems, along with a
                            litany of other rights which LDCs believe are necessary to permit them
                            economic equality with industrialized states. The immediate practical
                            impact of such a Charter is questionable. It should, however, be
                            evaluated less in pragmatic terms than as a manifesto of LDC goals.</p>
                        <p>The Economic Charter is a declaration of intent to change practice. Its
                            consequences will only gradually become apparent, but other LDC efforts
                            to revise international institutions may yield more immediate results.
                            Codified procedures offer easier targets than commercial practices. One
                            of the last acts of the 29th General Assembly was to call for a special
                            conference in the summer of 1975 to discuss proposals for revising the
                            UN Charter.** Contemplated reforms focus on the special prerogatives
                            given major powers under the 1945 agreement. LDCs may, for example,
                            propose Charter revisions which would give veto powers to additional
                            Council members by creating permanent regional seats. An African and
                            Asian permanent seat holder might then exercise the same veto powers as
                            now held by the current permanent members -- the US, <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, China, United Kingdom, and France.
                            Under present arrangements LDCs can only block decisions of the
                            15-member Council if they muster seven votes against or in abstention,
                            thereby denying a resolution the requisite nine affirmative votes.</p>
                        <p>**Article 108 provides that Charter amendments may be proposed by a
                            two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and ratified by two-thirds of
                            the UN membership, subject however to vetoes by the five permanent
                            Security Council members. This procedure was followed for the 1965
                            amendment to increase the number of non-permanent Security Council
                            members. The 1950 "uniting for peace" resolution provides an example,
                            however, of fundamental charter reform by a resolution. Initiated by the
                            US, the resolution provides that when the Security Council is unable to
                            act on a matter which threatens international peace, the Assembly may
                            take actions including the use of armed forces. LDCs could decide to
                            follow this example and attempt to alter UN procedures through Assembly
                            resolutions which, of course, are not subject to vetoes. </p>
                        <p>The institutional targets of LDCs also include international conferences
                            and technical organizations. For some time, LDCs have protested special
                            representation formulas and other advantages usually enjoyed by the five
                            permanent Security Council members in such gatherings. Preparations for
                            the Caracas Law of the Sea (<gloss target="#t_LOS1">LOS</gloss>)
                            Conference, for example, were delayed by a challenge to the
                            hitherto-automatic US seat on conference committees. The substantive LOS
                            negotiations, like most global conferences in recent years, have also
                            been shaped by the contrapositions between developing countries and
                            industrial powers, with LDCs seeking to barter their majority consent in
                            exchange for authority and economic benefits under any new international
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>LDCs have also shown increasing willingness to exploit their voting
                            strength in technical organizations and hold the operation of such
                            bodies hostage to their political goals of redistributing representation
                            and power. They have injected special causes, such as recognition of
                            revolutionary movements, into deliberations of UN specialized agencies
                            charged with coordination of industrial, commercial, and social
                            affairs.* Although LDC solidarity in these agencies does not yet
                            approach the militancy found in the Assembly, it has begun to impede the
                            agencies' supposedly apolitical work. Since the substantive work of
                            these technical organizations is much less vital to the LDCs than to
                            industrialized states with global commercial interests, LDC voting
                            majorities in these agencies are yet another pressure point. Having long
                            heard the theme of an interdependent world, LDCs are now prepared to ask
                            if the Western world can afford not to have their cooperation. In short,
                            LDCs are developing more leverage -- along with new confidence and skill
                            -- to exert in their many points of contention with the West.</p>

                        <p>Changing Balance </p>
                        <p>The US position in the UN continued to deteriorate in the 29th General
                            Assembly. While the general US position in world politics may also have
                            weakened in recent years, UN politics magnify the particularly
                            troublesome field of relations with LDCs -- one of the most difficult
                            and least rewarding areas of US relations.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the UN itself is an organization with decreasing usefulness not
                            just for the US but for all its members. The General Assembly is losing
                            its potential to function as anything other than a forum for airing LDC
                            complaints. As noise levels rise and tolerance levels drop, the
                            Assembly's tumultuous atmosphere overrides its substantive concerns. The
                            proliferation of special conferences attempting to do the work of the
                            Assembly is a symptom of its degeneration.* The increased emphasis by
                            the LDCs on fundamental rearrangements of international relations will
                            generate demands which the organization is far less capable of serving
                            than the comparatively simple demands of technical and economic
                            assistance. UN podiums can be used to announce desired reforms for
                            interstate relations, but can do little to implement or even legitimize
                            those plans. To affect the patterns of relations outside its halls the
                            UN just have the active involvement of all groups of states; to serve
                            the new direction of LDC interests, the UN more than ever needs to be a
                            global organization. Instead, the UN is rapidly becoming an organization
                            with only one constituency, and an organization less capable of serving
                            even that group's interests.</p>
                        <p>*The ad hoc conference forum is becoming the preferred arena for the
                            special concerns of both developing and industrial states. The 1974
                            food, population, and law of the sea conferences will be followed in
                            1975 by conferences on water, science and technology, housing,
                            desertification, women, and, once again, law of the sea.</p>
                        <p>Thus, if carried to an extreme, the new LDC pressures could undermine the
                            remaining importance of the UN -- turning it into a diplomatic shell
                            with little financial or political support -- and in a sense resolve the
                            problem of US embarrassments in the General Assembly. At the same time,
                            however, the US would lose the benefits derived from the Security
                            Council and the specialized agencies. In the past it has been possible
                            for the US to maintain different postures, consonant with the different
                            atmospheres in the various UN bodies. The reformationist turn of the LDC
                            movement will make such distinctions far more difficult. These trends
                            can be reversed, and the UN made more hospitable and useful to the US,
                            only if relations with the LDCs are improved outside the UN.</p>

                            PREPARATIONS BY COMMENTING ON TACTICAL AND SUBSTANTIVE POSSIBILITIES
                            RELATING TO SPECIFIC COUNTRIES AND TO REPORT THINKING OF HOST COUNTRIES
                            AS INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE (NO SPECIAL DEMARCHES ARE REQUESTED).
                            WE SEE 7TH SS AS TEST OF WHETHER RESPONSIBLE DISCUSSION OF AND ACTION ON
                            CRITICAL WORLD ISSUES OF CONCERN TO BOTH LDCS AND US CAN TAKE PLACE IN
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY CONTEXT. TO BE MEANINGFUL TEST, WE APPRECIATE THAT WE
                            AND OTHER DCS NEED TO MAKE SERIOUS AND SUSTAINED EFFORT TO PREPARE FOR
                            SESSION. MOREOVER, EVIDENT SIGNIFICANCE OF WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS OF
                            ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE WARRANTS GENUINE EFFORT BY US TO INFLUENCE
                            MAJOR MEETINGS LIKE 7TH SS TOWARD COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE
                            DISCUSSION. OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVE WORKING TOWARDS 7TH SS AND BEYOND IN
                            30TH UNGA WILL BE TO FIND AREAS WHERE THERE IS POSSIBILITY OF MUTUAL
                            BENEFIT FOR BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE
                            WILL BE REVIEWING WITH OPEN MIND POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSTRUCTIVE US OR DC
                            INITIATIVES. IN MEANTIME, WE BELIEVE EFFORT SHOULD BEGIN TO ANALYZE
                            PROBLEMS, IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES, AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WHICH CAN HELP
                            US BEGIN TO SHIFT AWAY FROM RECENT PATTERNS OF CONFRONTATION. END

                        <p>2. ORIGIN OF 7TH SS. DECISION TO HOLD 7TH SS, ORIGINALLY A NON-ALIGNED
                            INITIATIVE, WAS TAKEN IN DECEMBER 1973 AT 28TH UNGA BY <gloss

                            ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND WITH FAILURE OF DCS TO TAKE WHAT THEY CONSIDERED
                            TO BE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO ASSIST DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. 6TH SPECIAL

                            PROGRAM OF ACTION ON ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC
                            ORDER. THESE DOCUMENTS, CONTAINING MANY FEATURES SERIOUSLY OBJECTIONABLE
                            TO U.S. AND OTHER DCS, COVERED ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF WORLD ECONOMIC
                            PROBLEMS, UTILIZING NOW-STANDARD LDC/NON-ALIGNED FORMULATIONS WHICH WERE
                            NOT SUBJECT TO GENUINE NEGOTIATION WITH DCS. SINCE THEN, RESOLUTIONS ON
                            7TH SS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BOTH IN <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                            DECADE WAS SUBJECT OF GENUINE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN LDCS AND DCS AND IS
                            ONE WHICH U.S. AND OTHER DCS GENERALLY SUPPORT, THOUGH WITH
                            RESERVATIONS. (FOR BACKGROUND, POSTS SHOULD REFER TO A-4568 AND STATE

                        <p>3. PREPARATIONS WILL BE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PREPARATORY COMMITTEE (OPEN
                            TO ALL UN MEMBERS) AND ECOSOC. AT ITS FIRST (ORGANIZATIONAL) SESSION
                            MARCH 3-7, <gloss target="#t_PREPCOM1">PREPCOM</gloss> AGREED TO SET UP
                            INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS AMONG MISSIONS IN NY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON NATURE
                            OF WORK OF 7TH SS AND ITS ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THERE WAS GENERAL
                            AGREEMENT 7TH SS SHOULD FOCUS ON LIMITED NUMBER OF PROBLEMS ON WHICH
                            LDCS LOOKED FORWARD TO "CONCRETE ACTION." LDC TONE WAS RELATIVELY
                            MODERATE. PREPCOM'S FIRST SUBSTANTIVE SESSION (JUNE 16-27) WILL PROVIDE
                            MUCH FULLER PICTURE OF PROSPECTS FOR 7TH SS.</p>
                        <p>4. CALENDAR OF RELATED MEETINGS. CONTENT AND TONE OF 7TH SS WILL BE
                            STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY RESULTS OF A MULTIPLICITY OF MEETINGS BOTH WITHIN
                            AND OUTSIDE THE UN SYSTEM. UN HAS BEGUN "MID-TERM REVIEW AND APPRAISAL"
                            OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. ECOSOC'S REVIEW AND APPRAISAL
                            COMMITTEE WILL MEET IN MAY. ECOSOC ITSELF WILL, AT ITS JULY SESSION,
                            CONSIDER REPORTS OF BOTH REVIEW AND APPRAISAL COMMITTEE AND 7TH SS
                            PREPCOM. OTHER IMPORTANT UN MEETINGS ARE SECOND GENERAL CONFERENCE OF
                            UNIDO (ENDED MARCH 26), AND THE PLENARY MEETINGS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC
                            COMMISSIONS. OUTSIDE UN FRAMEWORK, THE PROPOSED OIL PRODUCER/CONSUMER
                            CONFERENCE WILL BE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE. ALSO SIGNIFICANT WILL BE
                            SUCH MEETINGS AS <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
                            COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE, <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>

                            IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OPENING OF 7TH SS.</p>
                        <p>5. INTERESTS OF LDCS. WE CANNOT NOW BE CERTAIN OF DETAILS OR FORM OF
                            PROPOSALS LIKELY TO BE MADE BY LDCS FOR CONSIDERATION AND ENDORSEMENT AT
                            7TH SS. HOWEVER, ON BASIS OF PAST LDC POSITIONS AND SUCH RECENT
                            DEVELOPMENTS AS DAKAR CONFERENCE ON COMMODITIES, MINISTERIAL MEETING OF
                            ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR AFRICA AND PRE-UNIDO MINISTERIAL MEETING OF
                            GROUP OF 77 IN ALGIERS, WE HAVE FAIR IDEA OF POSSIBILITIES INCLUDING
                            EXTREME PROGRAM BEING PUSHED HARD BY ALGERIA. LDC GROUP OF 77 IS
                            GENERALLY SEEKING TO ALTER DRASTICALLY RELATIVE ECONOMIC POWER OF DCS
                            AND LDCS. LONG LIST OF ITEMS IERMO LDCS WILL PROBABLY INCLUDE AT LEAST
                            THE FOLLOWING:</p>
                        <p>A. INCREASED EXPORT EARNINGS FROM PRIMARY COMMODITIES. THE DAKAR
                            CONFERENCE, IN ESSENCE, CALLS FOR CARTELIZATION THROUGH ESTABLISHMENT OF
                            PRODUCER ASSOCIATIONS AND AN UMBRELLA COUNCIL TO COORDINATE THEM.
                            HOWEVER, A LESS EXTREME APPROACH DEALING COMPREHENSIVELY WITH MANY
                            COMMODITIES BUT INVOLVING COOPERATION BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND CONSUMERS
                            HAS BEEN ADVOCATED BY MANY LDCS AT <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. ASSURED FUTURE MARKETS THROUGH A "NEW INTERNATIONAL DIVISION OF LABOR"
                            UNDER WHICH DEVELOPED COUNTRY GOVERNMENTS WOULD REDIRECT DOMESTIC LABOR
                            FROM LDC COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY TO OTHER PRODUCTION.</p>
                        <p>C. INDEXATION OF LDC EXPORTS AS AGAINST IMPORTS FROM DCS IN ORDER TO
                            PROTECT LDCS FROM CONSEQUENCES OF INFLATION IN DEVELOPED WORLD AND ALSO,
                            PERHAPS, MONETARY FLUCTUATIONS.</p>
                        <p>D. EXPANSION OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY OFFICIAL AID, DEBT
                            RENEGOTIATION AND CANCELLATION, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY ON BETTER TERMS,
                            THE <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>-AID LINK AND A SERIES OF SPECIAL
                            FUNDS, SUCH AS FOR LAND LOCKED AND LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; COMBINED
                            WITH EMPHASIS ON DEPENDABILITY AND "AUTOMATICITY" OF FLOWS.</p>
                        <p>E. PROTECTION AGAINST DC ECONOMIC PENETRATION THROUGH LEGALLY BINDING
                            CODES OF CONDUCT FOR SHIPPING, INSURANCE, TRANSNATIONAL
                            CORPORATIONS.</p>
                        <p>F. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RIGHT TO AN ENHANCED LDC ROLE IN ECONOMIC
                            DECISION-MAKING IN THE WORLD'S KEY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,
                            PARTICULARLY THE <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss

                        <p>G. STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE UN TO CARRY OUT LDC ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES. THIS
                            COULD INCLUDE GENERAL STEPS LIKE TRYING TO GIVE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY,
                            WHERE THE LDC/NON-ALIGNED MAJORITY IS MOST POTENT, MORE PLANNING AND
                            SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITY OVER VARIOUS PARTS OF UN SYSTEM; AND SPECIFIC
                            STEPS TO MAKE CONCRETE CHANGES IN VARIOUS BODIES WITHIN THE UN SYSTEM,
                            E.G. MAKING <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss> A CAPITAL INVESTMENT
                            INSTITUTION AS WELL AS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AGENCY, OR TRANSFORMING
                            UNCTAD INTO A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION BODY TO SUPPLANT GATT.</p>
                        <p>6. U.S. INTERESTS. U.S. WILL HAVE MULTIPLICITY OF INTERESTS IN CONNECTION
                            WITH 7TH SS,--SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL. WHILE
                            IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> DECIDES
                            UPON POSSIBILITY OF ANY SPECIFIC NEW SUBSTANTIVE POSITIONS, WE CAN
                            IDENTIFY NOW A NUMBER OF GOALS WHICH IN ANY EVENT WILL BE OF IMPORTANCE
                            TO US:</p>
                        <p>A. SUBSTANCE.</p>
                        <p>(I) 7TH SS WILL BE TAKING PLACE AGAINST BACKDROP OF WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC
                            CONTRACTION AND, IN MANY CASES, SERIOUS HARDSHIP. WITH CRITICAL WORLD
                            ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THUS DEMANDING ATTENTION, WE BELIEVE THAT MAXIMUM
                            PRACTICAL GAIN FOR ALL COULD BE ACHIEVED BY CONCENTRATING DISCUSSION AND
                            SEARCH FOR AGREEMENT ON LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS, AS OPPOSED
                            TO EFFORT TO PRODUCE YET ANOTHER CONTENTIOUS AND ALL EMBRACING CHARTER.
                            TYPE OF MEASURES AND APPROACH WE HAVE PROPOSED TO MEET WORLD FOOD
                            PROBLEM ARE OF THIS NATURE. AT SAME TIME, WE INTEND TO EXPRESS WITH
                            INCREASING CANDOR AND VIGOR GENERAL US APPROACHES TO BASIC ECONOMIC
                            PROBLEMS IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL (E.G. FOOD) AND WHERE WE
                            THINK OTHERS WOULD DO WELL TO LOOK MORE REALISTICALLY AT CHALLENGES AND
                            OPPORTUNITIES. WE ALSO INTEND IN THIS CONNECTION TO COUNTER MORE
                            ENERGETICALLY THAN IN PAST ALLEGATIONS THAT ECONOMIC TROUBLES IN THE
                            THIRD WORLD ARE ESSENTIALLY RESULT OF DC POLICIES.</p>
                        <p>(II) WE HAVE RECOGNIZED, AS IN SECRETARY'S RECENT SPEECH IN LOS ANGELES,
                            GOAL OF IMPROVING THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY--IN COMMODITIES,
                            TRADE, MONETARY RELATIONS AND INVESTMENT. THEREFORE, WE ARE SYMPATHETIC
                            TO BASIC ASPIRATIONS OF LDCS TO WORK TOWARD MORE JUST AND EFFECTIVE
                            ECONOMIC SYSTEM. HOWEVER, TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD THIS GOAL,
                            WE WILL NEED TO IMPRESS ON LDCS THAT PROGRESS MUST BE BASED ON REALISTIC
                            FACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE WORLD ECONOMIC
                            SITUATION, THAT IT MUST BE DIRECTED TOWARDS GREATER PRODUCTION OF WEALTH
                            RATHER THAN REDISTRIBUTION OF EXISTING WEALTH, AND THAT MEASURES MUST
                            RELATE TO ACTUAL DYNAMICS OF INTERDEPENDENCE. WE WILL BE GUIDED IN OUR
                            REVIEW BY DESIRE TO DEFINE APPROACHES WHICH ARE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL, FOR
                            EXAMPLE, IN COMMODITY TRADE AREA, THE PROMOTION OF ASSURED SUPPLIES,
                            STABILITY OF PRICES, AND EXPANSION IN SUPPLY OF RESOURCES FOR GROWTH OF
                            LDCS AND DCS.</p>
                        <p>(III) RE STRUCTURAL REFORM OF UN. WE ARE STUDYING POSSIBLE INITIATIVES
                            WHICH MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO EFFECTIVENESS OF UN SYSTEM IN CARRYING OUT
                            PROGRAMS OF INTEREST TO BOTH DCS AND LDCS. SUCH PROPOSALS WILL BE
                            DESIGNED TO BE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL. WE WILL, HOWEVER, DISCOURAGE CHARTER
                            AMENDMENT AND OPPOSE PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO FURTHER CONCENTRATE
                            ORGANIZATIONAL CONTROL WITH THE LDCS/NON-ALIGNED.</p>
                        <p>B. PROCEDURE AND TACTICS. AT MINIMUM, WE WILL WORK TO PREVENT REPETITION
                            OF "STEAMROLLER TACTICS" EMPLOYED BY LDCS/NON-ALIGNED AT 6TH SS BY WHICH
                            FALSE CONSENSUS WAS REGISTERED AS DECISION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY. MOST
                            CONSTRUCTIVE TYPE OF OUTCOME WOULD BE GA DECISIONS TO ENDORSE OR
                            ENCOURAGE CERTAIN PROJECTS OR MEASURES ON WHICH THERE IS GENUINE AND
                            BROAD CONSENSUS. WE CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL NOT TO DAMAGE ROLE AND STATUS
                            OF VARIOUS BODIES LIKE WORLD BANK, IMF AND GATT, AND THEREFORE ANY
                            DECISIONS OF UNGA WOULD BE MORE IN SENSE OF IDENTIFYING AND ENCOURAGING
                            PRIORITY AREAS WHERE NEGOTIATION AND PROGRESS ARE POSSIBLE, RATHER THAN
                            PURPORTING TO MAKE DETAILED DECISIONS WHICH SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN
                            COMPETENCE OF BODIES OTHER THAN UNGA. HOWEVER, EVEN IF 7TH SS IS NOT
                            ABLE TO TAKE DECISIONS OF THE TYPE DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT WILL STILL BE A
                            SIGNIFICANT STEP UP FROM LAST SPECIAL SESSION IF 7TH SS IS STIMULUS FOR
                            MORE RESPONSIBLE EXPLORATION OF SERIOUS ECONOMIC ISSUES AND LEADS TO
                            GREATER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS. WHEN WE CHARACTERIZE
                            7TH SS AS CONSTITUTING SOMETHING OF A TEST, IT IS NOT IN SENSE OF
                            EXPECTING A REVOLUTION OR TOTAL REVERSAL IN THE BEHAVIOR OF ALL
                            PARTICIPANTS. RATHER, WE WISH TO SEE WHETHER A NEW START CAN BE MADE
                            TOWARD HANDLING IMPORTANT ISSUES IN MORE COOPERATIVE MANNER. WE HOPE
                            THAT LDCS WILL COME TO ACCEPT THAT CONFRONTATION AND COOPERATION CANNOT
                            CONTINUE TO CO-EXIST, THAT PURSUIT OF CONFRONTATION POLITICS AT UN WILL
                            THREATEN VIABILITY OF ORGANIZATION AND JEOPARDIZE CONTINUING FULL US
                            SUPPORT.</p>

                            SS WE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM ACTION
                            ADDRESSEES WHICH WILL HELP US TO TARGET MOST EFFECTIVELY OUR FUTURE
                            EFFORTS WITH LDCS. CAN POSTS IDENTIFY ANY EXISTING OR EMERGING
                            SUBSTANTIVE INTERESTS WHICH MIGHT LEAD HOST COUNTRIES TO PURSUE
                            INDIVIDUAL CONCERNS AND NEEDS IN DISCUSSION WITH DCS RATHER THAN TO
                            FOLLOW TOTALLY THE MORE RADICAL LDC/NON-ALIGNED LEADERSHIP? (THIS
                            QUESTION OBVIOUSLY NOT RELEVANT FOR SOME ADDRESSEES.) WE HAVE NOTED SOME
                            EMERGING STRAINS BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND OIL PRODUCERS, E.G., PHILIPPINE
                            PRESSURES AGAINST OIL PRODUCERS AT DAKAR CONFERENCE. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD
                            OF GROWING RESENTMENT BY SOME LDCS AGAINST HIGH-HANDED STEAMROLLER
                            TACTICS EMPLOYED BY ALGERIANS AT RECENT NON-ALIGNED AND LDC MEETINGS.
                            CAN THIS SITUATION OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERIOUS CONSULTATIONS WITH
                            LDCS WITH PROSPECT OF GREATER GENUINE COOPERATION LATER? WHAT IS LIKELY
                            TO BE BEST METHOD, TIMING, VENUE AND LEVEL FOR CONSULTATIONS? OUR
                            THINKING HAS BEEN THAT EXAMINATION OF PROBLEMS AND COORDINATION OF
                            GENERAL APPROACHES SHOULD FIRST TAKE PLACE AMONG DCS AND SHOULD EXPAND
                            TO LDCS.</p>

                            CONTACTS, EMBASSIES LEARN THINKING OF HOST OFFICIALS ON SUBSTANTIVE AND

                        <p>SUBJECT: American Strategy at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>President: I almost reconsidered asking you. I read in Human Events
                            something very complimentary about you. [Laughter].</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That Commentary article is one of the most important articles
                            in a long time. That is why it is essential to have him at the UN.</p>
                        <p>President: I am delighted you will do it.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: I will. I have no illusions about it. The Commentary article
                            makes two points: we are still acting in the same posture we had in the
                            past when we had a majority -- so we still seek a consensus. The only
                            consensus now is screw the United States. The reputation of the US keeps
                            eroding and that reputation is important to us.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: We even cooperate in resolutions directed through codewords
                            against us. This erodes our image further.</p>
                        <p>President: Your new posture will delight the Congress. The UN is not the
                            most popular institution in the world here now.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: The public will be delighted. We have to rally the American
                            public and show the world we are strong and determined. If we appear at
                            the UN with Pat's wisdom, strength and toughness. How we are going to
                            behave is important.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Right. Are we going to give up a fight? </p>
                        <p>President: This is our campaign now.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: In the UN we are like the Republicans in Congress. But in doing
                            this we will make some mistakes. But we will make some, as against the
                            total mistake we're making now. But we can't aim only at the Third
                            World. The Soviet Union and China make devastating charges against the
                            US and we never respond.</p>
                        <p>President: I want strong statements and the guts to veto and vote
                            against.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: If you think you are under Soviet and Chinese usages -- you
                            shouldn't initiate, but respond. With China, let's consult on a
                            case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: I have one specific proposal. One mistake we make is acting
                            like the General Assembly has semi-legislative powers. The Soviet Union
                            believed it when we had a majority. Now it is being used against us. We
                            have to go back to the Charter.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: We need a strategy. In principle, I think we should move
                            things from the General Assembly to the Security Council. It is
                            important to see that we have our confidence and nerve. The Tanzanian,
                            if he attacks the Soviet Union, is in trouble; if he attacks the US, he
                            must know he is in equal trouble. Also we must get hold of the
                            Specialized Agencies.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Should we have staff changes?</p>
                        <p>President: Do our people stay there in perpetuity?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: The personnel is ready to rotate anyway. You can clean out
                            both in the Mission and the delegation. We can't do much about the
                            Congressional members. We should pick the other public members for other
                            than pure political reasons.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: For 25 years there have been high politics and low politics in
                            State. High politics was security and that was where reputations work.
                            The UN, etc., was low politics; where Mrs. Roosevelt and those who
                            weren't up to the struggle went. If word went out that words matter, we
                            could turn this around.</p>
                        <p>President: This coincides with what I said Thursday. What we said, we
                            meant. That is what I hope you will do.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: But in a conciliatory not belligerent way. We are too dangerous
                            to be pushed around.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I will staff State to back you up.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Would this carry on the tradition of my nominally being in the
                            Cabinet?</p>
                        <p>President: I plan to see Scali Monday. Is that okay?</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: There aren't six people in State who understand a Leninist
                            argument. We have to retrain people. One thing: They will move to oust
                            Israel. They had the chutzpah to meet in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: This one thing we have to hit -- for the non-aligned to meet
                            in Cuba and claim non-alignment. They can't throw them out but they can
                            refuse them a seat in the General Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> will still be chairman for the Special
                            Session but for the regular session we will have a European. In 1976 it
                            will be someone from the Middle East, though, and we would have a
                            massive problem.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: If we can head it off we can avoid a debacle in '76. It won’t
                            hurt Israel much but it will reduce American support.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: But it is no different from South Africa. That was an outrage.
                            We have to keep fighting that, or the Group of 77 will be deciding UN
                            membership.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: We should say we are not sympathetic to the regime, but it is a
                            matter of principle.</p>
                        <p>President: I hope you can get out around the country to speak.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Yes. And the Congress. <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss> is something a lot of people care about. Israel was
                            expelled. I would like to be firm and say you can't expel Israel and
                            expect us to participate -- because we are getting pressure to get back
                            in and forget the Israeli expulsion.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That should be considered as part of a general strategy. </p>
                        <p>President: I am delighted, Pat. We are on the same wave length.</p>

                                corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> DELIVERED A MAJOR ADDRESS
                            BEFORE AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE IN MILWAUKEE REGARDING BROAD GOALS OF US
                            FOREIGN POLICY AND US PARTICIPATION IN THE UN. WE WISH TO MAKE EVERY
                            EFFORT TO ASSURE THAT THIS SPEECH IS GIVEN CAREFUL ATTENTION BY
                            GOVERNMENT LEADERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR COUNTRIES'
                            POLICIES AT THE SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
                            (SEPTEMBER 1-12), AT THE SUBSEQUENT REGULAR 30TH <gloss

                            CONFERENCES AND CONSULTATIONS. IT IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN INVITING
                            THE ATTENTION OF HOST GOVERNMENTS TO THIS SPEECH TO MAINTAIN A CAREFUL
                            BALANCE BETWEEN OUR CURRENT CONCERNS WITH TRENDS IN THE UN SYSTEM (BLOC
                            VOTING, EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE MEMBER STATES, EFFORTS TO "LEGISLATE" A NEW
                            WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER) AND OUR CONTINUING CONVICTION THAT IT HAS AN
                            INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY BOTH IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND
                            IN THE EVOLUTION OF NEW ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS. EXCEPT AT POSTS WHERE
                            RELATIONSHIPS MAKE IT INAPPROPRIATE, CHIEFS OF MISSION SHOULD CALL ON
                            LEADING OFFICIALS OF THE HOST COUNTRIES AND INVITE THEIR ATTENTION TO
                            THE SPEECH STRESSING THE POINTS WHICH FOLLOW. WITH SENIOR FOREIGN
                            MINISTRY OFFICIALS, THEY SHOULD ALSO INDICATE THAT SPEECH OUTLINES
                            CURRENT US ATTITUDE TOWARD UN BUT DOES NOT ADDRESS IN DETAIL THE ISSUES
                            BEFORE THE TWO FALL SESSIONS WHICH WE WILL BE PREPARED SHORTLY TO
                            DISCUSS WITH APPROPRIATE HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.</p>

                            IN PART AS A RESPONSE TO CONTINUING PUBLIC AND CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN

                            TOWARD PARTICIPATION IN THE ASSEMBLY.</p>
                        <p>HENCE, IT APPEARED TIMELY SIX WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF THE FALL SESSIONS WHILE
                            MEMBER STATES WERE ADDRESSING THEIR OWN POLICIES AND REGIONAL GROUP
                            POLICIES IN THE UN TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CONSIDER THE UN SYSTEM TO BE
                            POTENTIALLY ENDANGERED DESPITE THE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE ROLE IT IS
                            PLAYING IN PEACEKEEPING AND IN THE MANY FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF THE
                            SPECIALIZED AGENCIES AND THE POTENTIALLY VALUABLE ROLE IT CAN PLAY IN
                            WORKING TOWARD AGREEMENT IN CURRENT ECONOMIC ISSUES. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>3. MAIN THEMES:</p>
                        <p>-- THE UNITED NATIONS CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN A WORLD OF
                            INCREASING INTERDEPENDENCE -- BUT ONLY IF RECENT DISTURBING TRENDS ARE
                            REVERSED AND A NEW SPIRIT AND PRACTICE INTRODUCED.</p>
                        <p>-- SECRETARY’S STATEMENT FOUNDED ON CONVICTION THAT UN CONTINUES TO BE AN
                            IMPORTANT FOCUS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION BOTH IN FIELD OF
                            MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AND IN HANDLING GLOBAL
                            PROBLEMS WITH WHICH ONLY WORLD BODY CAN COPE. (SPEECH CONTAINS NUMEROUS
                            POSITIVE REFERENCES REGARDING OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE UNITED NATIONS
                            WHICH HAVE BEEN INADEQUATELY REFLECTED IN US PRESS COVERAGE. YOU SHOULD
                            THEREFORE EMPHASIZE THESE POSITIVE ASPECTS.)</p>
                        <p>-- STATEMENT EMPHASIZES THE HIGH PRIORITY OF PEACEKEEPING IN AREAS OF
                            CONFLICT SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND CYPRUS AND THE URGENT NEED TO HALT
                            THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND REVERSE THE ARMS RACE AMONG MAJOR
                            POWERS.</p>
                        <p>-- STATEMENT IS PART OF A CONCERTED AND LONG-RANGE EFFORT OF THE UNITED
                            STATES TO PLACE OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE DEVELOPING
                            WORLD IN MULTILATERAL FORUMS ON A NEW FOOTING. IT, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE
                            VIEWED AS PART OF A SERIES OF MAJOR STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE AT
                            KANSAS CITY AND THE <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> IN PARIS (WITH
                            WHICH POSTS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR).</p>
                        <p>-- SECRETARY STATES THAT WE INTEND TO CONTRIBUTE PRACTICAL PROPOSALS
                            DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE MUTUAL BENEFIT AND WHICH COULD PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR
                            SERIOUS WORK BETWEEN DCS AND LDCS. WITHIN <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>, WORK IS PROCEEDING INTENSIVELY TO DEVELOP SUCH
                            PROPOSALS ALONG THE LINES EARLIER OUTLINED.</p>
                        <p>-- (IF ASKED, YOU SHOULD SAY THAT FACT THAT HE DID NOT FURTHER ELABORATE
                            ON THE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF POSSIBLE PROPOSALS WHICH WE INTEND TO PRESENT
                            AT THE OPENING OF THE 7TH SPECIAL SESSION IN NO WAY REFLECTS ANY SHIFT
                            IN DIRECTION ON OUR PART FROM THAT WHICH WAS INDICATED BY THE SECRETARY
                            IN HIS PARIS AND OECD SPEECHES, WHERE SOME OF OUR APPROACHES WERE
                            OUTLINED. THIS SPEECH WAS DESIGNED TO BE A SCENE-SETTER, NOT A VEHICLE
                            FOR NEW INITIATIVES.)</p>
                        <p>-- IT IS BECAUSE WE TAKE THIS BASIC CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH THAT WE FEEL IT
                            IS NECESSARY TO SPEAK FRANKLY ABOUT PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED IN
                            RECENT YEARS AND WHICH, AS SECRETARY'S SPEECH POINTS OUT, COULD THREATEN
                            THE FUTURE CAPABILITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND OUR POSSIBILITY OF
                            COOPERATING WITHIN IT.</p>
                        <p>-- A) TO EXCLUDE COUNTRIES FROM PARTICIPATION IN UN ACTIVITIES BY MEANS
                            OTHER THAN THOSE PROVIDED IN ARTICLES 5 AND 6 OF UN CHARTER (WHICH
                            SPECIFY SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION MUST BE RECOMMENDED TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY
                            BY SECURITY COUNCIL) BECAUSE THEIR POLICIES ARE DISLIKED, COULD THREATEN
                            THE INTEGRITY AND SURVIVAL OF THE BODY WHICH EXCLUDES THEM. ARBITRARY
                            IMPOSITION OF SUCH A DECISION OVER THE OPPOSITION OF MEMBER STATES WHICH
                            PROVIDE VITAL SUPPORT TO THE ORGANIZATION COULD JEOPARDIZE THE
                            CONTINUING VIABILITY OF THE UN. FURTHERMORE, IF THE UN IS TO DO SERIOUS
                            BUSINESS AND TO COME TO GRIPS REALISTICALLY WITH IMPORTANT PROBLEMS, IT
                            WOULD BE ILLOGICAL TO EXCLUDE FROM PARTICIPATION COUNTRIES WHOSE
                            POLICIES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS TRYING TO INFLUENCE.</p>
                        <p>-- B) IF A UN SPECIALIZED AGENCY IS TRANSFORMED INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON,
                            IT LOSES THE ABILITY TO COPE WITH ITS FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC, TECHNICAL
                            AND SOCIAL TASKS AND US PUBLIC OPINION WOULD SEE NO PURPOSE IN
                            SUPPORTING SUCH AN AGENCY.</p>
                        <p>-- C) IF WE CANNOT BEGIN TO MAKE A TURNING FROM PAST PATTERNS OF
                            CONFRONTATION AND LAY THE CONDITIONS OF REASONED DISCOURSE AND CONCRETE
                            PROGRESS, THE US AND OTHER NATIONS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED WITH THESE ISSUES
                            MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LOOK TO OTHER WAYS AND FORA IN WHICH TO DEAL
                            WITH THEM. WE THINK IT REASONABLE TO ASK THAT OUR OWN SERIOUS AND NEW
                            EFFORT TOWARDS COOPERATION BE RECIPROCATED. THE WORLD COMMUNITY CANNOT
                            MAKE PROGRESS ON ITS</p>
                        <p>MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS, IN THE UN OR ELSEWHERE, UNLESS THERE IS A
                            CONCERTED AND CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO REVERSE SOME OF THE PRACTICES WHICH
                            HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED IN UNITED NATIONS BODIES, AND THE UNITED STATES
                            WILL NOT BE ABLE, BECAUSE OF CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC, TO BE FORTHCOMING
                            IN THE FACE OF VILIFICATION AND CONFRONTATION. (AMBASSADORS SHOULD MAKE
                            STRONG APPEALS TO FOREIGN MINISTERS TO TAKE DIRECT AND PERSONAL INTEREST
                            IN SEEING TO IT THAT HOST COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES AT UN BODIES MAKE THE
                            NECESSARY EFFORTS TO CONCENTRATE ON AREAS OF COMMON CONCERN AND, IF
                            APPROPRIATE, TO AVOID GETTING COMMITTED PRIOR TO THE TWO SESSIONS TO
                            RIGID POSITIONS WHICH ARE THEN SOMETIMES MAINTAINED AT UN SESSIONS BY
                            NARROW BLOC LEADERSHIP. DECLARATION OF WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AT MEXICO CITY
                            WAS MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF A BLOC DRAFT ON WHICH SPONSORS REFUSED TO
                            NEGOTIATE CHANGES.)</p>
                        <p>-- SECRETARY'S SPEECH, WHILE FOCUSING ON THESE AREAS OF CONCERN, IS AT
                            THE SAME TIME AN APPEAL TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE
                            UNITED NATIONS BOTH ON THE KEY ISSUES BEFORE THE TWO ASSEMBLY SESSIONS
                            AND ON THE METHODS OF RESOLVING THEM. WE ARE ALREADY IN TOUCH AT <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> WITH NUMEROUS OTHER NATIONS'
                            REPRESENTATIVES IN ORDER TO DEFINE ECONOMIC ISSUES WHICH THE SEVENTH
                            SPECIAL SESSION SHOULD ADDRESS AND WILL WISH TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THESE
                            ISSUES WITH HOST GOVERNMENT WHEN THIS PROCESS IS FURTHER ADVANCED.
                            MEANTIME, WE ARE PREPARED TO DISCUSS THE MAIN POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL
                            ISSUES OF INTEREST TO BOTH COUNTRIES AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY (SEE
                            SEPCIRTEL). WE INVITE AT THE SAME TIME CONSIDERED HOST GOVERNMENT VIEWS
                            OF SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON WHICH POSTS MAY OFFER FURTHER CLARIFICATION
                            AND DISCUSSION.</p>
                        <p>4. SINCE THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION AND QUESTIONING ON WHAT SECRETARY'S
                            JULY 14 SPEECH MEANS IN TERMS OF US REACTION IF ISRAEL IS SUSPENDED OR
                            EXCLUDED FROM GENERAL ASSEMBLY, POSTS MAY, IF ASKED, USE FOLLOWING
                            ANSWER GIVEN BY SECRETARY TO PRESS ON JULY 15 IN MINNEAPOLIS NEWS
                            BRIEFING: "WELL, WE HAVE NOT SAID EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL DO IF THE CHARTER
                            OF THE UNITED NATIONS IS VIOLATED IN OUR VIEW. WE BELIEVE THAT THE
                            EXPULSION OF MEMBER STATES BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS A

                            SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN CHECKING THIS MOMENTUM. THE DECISIVE
                            FACTOR MAY WELL BE PROGRESS ON MIDDLE EAST PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. AS USG
                            HAS PUBLICLY STATED AT HIGHEST LEVELS, US IS COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO ANY
                            MOVES TO SUSPEND OR EXPEL ISRAEL FROM THE GA OR ANY PART OF THE UN
                            SYSTEM, WHICH COULD INVOLVE ENTIRE FUTURE OF UN, FAR BEYOND ARAB/ISRAELI
                            QUESTION. AS SECRETARY OF STATE POINTED OUT IN JULY 14 MILWAUKEE SPEECH
                            ON UN, OUR POSITION IS "CONSTITUTIONAL", (BASED ON ARTICLES 5 AND 6) AND
                            OUR CONCERN IS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE UN CHARTER, IN WHICH THE
                            PREROGATIVES OF SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION ARE CLEARLY GIVEN TO THE
                            SECURITY COUNCIL SO THAT INTEGRITY AND FUTURE OF GA MAY BE MAINTAINED.
                            US PUBLIC REACTION TO SUCH A MOVE WOULD BE ENORMOUS AND THIS EROSION OF
                            PUBLIC SUPPORT WOULD IMPERIL FUTURE OF THE UN. THUS, UN WOULD BE

                            ENDANGERED. IN PARTICULAR SUCH AN ACTION WOULD MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD
                            PEACE MORE DIFFICULT BY UNDERCUTTING THOSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
                            ELSEWHERE WHO ARE WORKING FROM THE PREMISE THAT LEADING ARAB GOVERNMENTS
                            ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT ISRAEL AND MAKE PEACE.</p>

                            UNGA, THERE IS NO LIKELIHOOD THAT A MAJORITY OF COMMITTEE WILL APPROVE
                            THEM. ONCE THE ASSEMBLY HAS APPROVED THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT, THE NEW
                            PRESIDENT COULD BE ASKED WHETHER THE CREDENTIALS REJECTION PRECLUDES
                            SOUTH AFRICAN PARTICIPATION IN THE SESSION. IN RULING THAT SOUTH AFRICA
                            BE SUSPENDED FOR REMAINDER OF 29TH UNGA SESSION, BOUTEFLIKA DEPARTED
                            FROM THE HAMBRO PRECEDENT THAT REJECTION OF CREDENTIALS SHOULD BE
                            REGARDED AS CONDEMNATION, BUT HAS NO PRACTICAL EFFECT. US POSITION IS
                            THAT THE CREDENTIALS REVIEW PROCESS IS A TECHNICAL ONE, DESIGNED TO
                            VERIFY THAT PERSONS CLAIMING TO REPRESENT A GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN
                            AUTHORIZED BY THAT GOVERNMENT (SOUTH AFRICA MEETS THE TECHNICAL
                            CRITERIA), AND THAT REJECTION OF CREDENTIALS ON POLITICAL GROUND SHOULD
                            NOT LEAD TO EXCLUSION FROM UNGA (REF B). THIS MISUSE OF THE CREDENTIALS
                            MACHINERY TO PUNISH MEMBER STATES WHOSE INTERNAL POLICIES ARE UNPOPULAR
                            HOLDS OBVIOUS SERIOUS DANGER FOR THE UN. THIS IS METHOD OF SUSPENSION
                            CONTRARY TO CHARTER WHICH WE WILL STRONGLY OPPOSE. IN ADDITION, PRESSURE
                            WHICH SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ON <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                            THROUGH UN CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF SAG PARTICIPATES IN UNGA. USG
                            OPPOSITION TO SUSPENSION OF SOUTH AFRICA IN NO WAY ALTERS OUR STRONG
                            OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID.</p>
                        <p>B. RHODESIA. GA MAY AGAIN CALL ON UK TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO
                            ELIMINATE SMITH REGIME AND MAY CALL FOR AID TO RHODESIAN LIBERATION
                            MOVEMENTS. US REMAINS SYMPATHETIC TO AFRICAN CONCERNS UNDERLYING
                            PROPOSALS ON RHODESIA AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS OF BRITISH AND
                            AFRICANS TO NEGOTIATE END TO WHAT WE CONSIDER ILLEGAL MINORITY REGIME.
                            WE, HOWEVER, MUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE EXTREME SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION
                            AGAINST RHODESIA. OUR POSITION ON RESOLUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON LANGUAGE OF
                            DRAFT TEXTS.</p>
                        <p>C. NAMIBIA. USG ACCEPTED CONCLUSIONS 1971 <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> DECISION THAT SOUTH AFRICA OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW FROM
                            NAMIBIA AND HAS INDICATED REPEATEDLY TO SAG US CONCERN ABOUT SLOW
                            PROGRESS TOWARD POLITICAL SELF-DETERMINATION FOR NAMIBIA. WE WILL
                            CONTINUE TO DO SO. USG COULD NOT SUPPORT JUNE SECURITY COUNCIL
                            RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT BELIEVES MANDATORY SANCTIONS SHOULD BE RESERVED
                            FOR THE MOST ACUTE CASES OF THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.
                            WE ARE READY TO SUPPORT RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR EARLY SELF-DETERMINATION
                            UNDER UN SUPERVISION. USG DOES NOT BELIEVE SANCTIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE
                            IN REMOVING SOUTH AFRICAN ADMINISTRATION FROM NAMIBIA.</p>
                        <p>7. HUMAN RIGHTS. MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AT 30TH GA WILL BE CHILE,
                            TORTURE, IMPLEMENTATION OF ECOSOC 1503 PROCEDURES, AND RECURRING ITEMS
                            SUCH AS RACE DISCRIMINATION, APARTHEID, AND ISRAELI-OCCUPIED ARAB
                            TERRITORIES. CHILE HAS JUST DECIDED TO WITHDRAW ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE
                            WORKING GROUP (<gloss target="#t_WG1">WG</gloss>) SET UP BY HUMAN RIGHTS
                            COMMISSION TO EXAMINE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN CHILE. IT IS TOO EARLY
                            TO KNOW IF IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO GET THE WG BACK ON TRACK. CHILE'S
                            DECISION PUTS COUNTRIES LIKE THE US WHICH SUPPORTED THE MODERATE WG
                            APPROACH IN AN AWKWARD POSITION. FYI. WE HAVE TOLD CHILE THAT WE REGRET
                            ITS EXCLUSION OF THE WG. END FYI. POLEMICAL DEBATE AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS
                            STRONGLY CONDEMNING CHILE ARE VERY LIKELY. WE ALSO HAVE AN INDICATION
                            THAT CUBA MAY MOUNT A CAMPAIGN TO SUSPEND OR EXPEL CHILE FROM UNGA AS A
                            RESULT OF ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE UN. WHILE NOT WISHING TO GIVE WEIGHT
                            TO SUCH A MOVE BY FIGHTING IT PREMATURELY, IF THIS MATTER RAISED YOU
                            SHOULD INDICATE THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE IT STRONGLY ON CONSTITUTIONAL
                            GROUNDS. US IS CONSIDERING INTRODUCING PROPOSAL AT 30TH GA TO BUILD ON
                            LAST GA'S ANTI-TORTURE RESOLUTION AND WORK OF FIFTH UN CONGRESS ON THE
                            PREVENTION OF CRIME AND TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS MEETING IN GENEVA
                            SEPTEMBER 1-12 TO KEEP PRACTICE OF TORTURE BEFORE INTERNATIONAL FORUMS
                            AND PRESS FOR ACTION WHICH WILL RESULT IN EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF SUCH
                            PRACTICES. ECOSOC 1503 RESOLUTION PROVIDES METHODS FOR EXAMINING GROUP
                            OR PRIVATE CLAIMS OF GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. ECOSOC WILL REPORT
                            THAT THESE PROCEDURES RECEIVED INITIAL TEST AT FEBRUARY HUMAN RIGHTS
                            COMMISSION MEETING WHICH WE BELIEVE WAS FAVORABLE. US IS PLEASED THAT A
                            START HAS BEEN MADE TOWARDS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND HOPES THAT OTHER
                            COUNTRIES WILL JOIN IN SUPPORTING THEM. HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES CAN BE
                            EXPECTED TO ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH DEBATES ON SUCH RECURRING THEMES AS
                            RACE DISCRIMINATION, APARTHEID, AND ISRAELI-OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES.
                            SPECIFIC US POSITION ON THESE ITEMS WILL DEPEND ON NATURE OF PROPOSAL OR
                            RESOLUTION PUT FORWARD, BUT IN GENERAL US WILL CONCENTRATE ON PROMOTING
                            AND SUPPORTING MEASURES WHICH ARE BALANCED AND WILL LEAD TO FRUITFUL
                            PRACTICAL RESULTS.</p>
                        <p>8. DISARMAMENT. PROVISIONAL AGENDA OF 30TH UNGA ALREADY INCLUDES 16
                            DISARMAMENT ITEMS. GIVEN INCREASED INTEREST IN DISARMAMENT MATTERS
                            DISPLAYED AT LAST UNGA, WHEN 21 DISARMAMENT RESOLUTIONS WERE APPROVED,
                            THERE COULD WELL BE AS MANY OR MORE RESOLUTIONS THIS YEAR.</p>
                        <p>A. NUCLEAR ISSUES. NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (<gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                >NPT</gloss>) REVIEW CONFERENCE (HELD IN GENEVA MAY 5-30, 1975) MAY
                            GENERATE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AND SEVERAL RESOLUTIONS AT 30TH GA, EVEN
                            THOUGH REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF CONFERENCE RECOMMENDATIONS IS NOT
                            FORMALLY SCHEDULED UNTIL 31ST UNGA (1976). IN LINE WITH THIS US DOES NOT
                            PLAN ANY NPT INITIATIVE FOR 30TH UNGA. WE WERE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH
                            FINAL DECLARATION OF CONFERENCE, WHICH REAFFIRMED IMPORTANCE OF NPT, AND
                            RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN NON-PROLIFERATION EFFORT.
                            NON-ALIGNED AT CONFERENCE PUT FORWARD THREE DRAFT PROTOCOLS TO NPT.
                            FIRST WOULD HAVE KEYED MORATORIUM ON NUCLEAR TESTING BY DEPOSITARY
                            GOVERNMENTS (US, UK, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) TO
                            ADDITIONAL ACCESSIONS TO TREATY, AND CALLED FOR PERMANENT BAN ON ALL
                            TESTING AS SOON AS ALL NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES WERE PREPARED TO AGREE;
                            SECOND CALLED FOR 50 PERCENT REDUCTION OF VLADIVOSTOK CEILINGS ON
                            STRATEGIC ARMS LEVELS ON SAME BASIS; THIRD CALLED FOR NON-USE OF NUCLEAR
                            WEAPONS UNDERTAKINGS BY DEPOSITARIES VIS-À-VIS NON-NUCLEAR WEAPON NPT
                            PARTIES. US OPPOSED PROTOCOLS ON GROUNDS THEY WOULD IN EFFECT AMEND NPT
                            (WHICH WE DID NOT WISH) AND, IN CASE OF FIRST TWO, WOULD IMPOSE
                            UNREALISTIC TIME TABLES AND UNACCEPTABLE TERMS ON PARTIES TO ONGOING
                            NEGOTIATIONS. THIRD PROTOCOL, IN OUR VIEW, COULD IMPAIR SECURITY OF US
                            AND MANY NON-NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES PARTIES TO NPT. (WITH RESPECT TO
                            COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN, US REMAINS COMMITTED TO GOAL OF ADEQUATELY

                            ON-SITE INSPECTION IS REQUIRED.) WHILE NONE OF THESE PROTOCOLS HAD
                            REALISTIC CHANCE OF ADOPTION AT CONFERENCE OWING TO OPPOSITION BY NPT
                            DEPOSITARIES, THEY MAY RESURFACE AS PROPOSALS IN UNGA WHERE LDCS ARE
                            REPRESENTED IN GREATER NUMBERS.</p>

                            INCLUDES CARRY-OVER ITEMS ON NFZS IN MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTH
                            ASIA. IN ADDITION, NEW ZEALAND WILL PROPOSE NEW RESOLUTION ON SOUTH
                            PACIFIC NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE. PURSUANT TO 1974 GA RESOLUTION, UNGA WILL
                            ALSO HAVE BEFORE IT COMPREHENSIVE EXPERTS' STUDY (UNDER <gloss
                                target="#t_CCD1">CCD</gloss> AUSPICES) OF NFZ QUESTION IN ALL ITS
                            ASPECTS. USG CONSIDERS THAT APPROPRIATELY DRAWN NUCLEAR-FREE ZONES CAN
                            COMPLEMENT NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION OBJECTIVES, BUT WILL ASSESS
                            SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ON CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, APPLYING CRITERIA THAT NFZS
                            SHOULD:</p>
                        <p>(1) BE SPONSORED BY STATES IN AREA CONCERNED;</p>
                        <p>(2) INCLUDE ALL STATES IN AREA WHOSE PARTICIPATION IS IMPORTANT;</p>
                        <p>(3) NOT DISTURB NECESSARY SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS; AND</p>
                        <p>(4) PROVIDE FOR ADEQUATE VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION, IN
                            ORDER TO SERVE NONPROLIFERATION OBJECTIVES, ZONES SHOULD NOT PERMIT
                            INDIGENOUS DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVES FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

                            ZONE" DECLARATION CONTAINED IN ORIGINAL IOPZ RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY UNGA
                            IN 1971. TOGETHER WITH MOST MAJOR MARITIME STATES EXCEPT JAPAN, US
                            ABSTAINED ON THAT AND ALL SUBSEQUENT IOPZ RESOLUTIONS. THIS YEAR US
                            DECLINED (ALONG WITH UK, USSR, <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,

                            POSITION, POSTS SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT WHILE US SHARES AIM OF PROMOTING
                            PEACE AND TRANQUILITY IN INDIAN OCEAN REGION, WE DO NOT ACCEPT PREMISE
                            THAT REGIONAL GROUP OF STATES CAN IMPOSE SPECIAL LEGAL REGIME ON CERTAIN
                            PART OF HIGH SEAS, AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT APPROACH OF DECLARING "ZONE
                            OF PEACE" CAN ADEQUATELY RESOLVE COMPLEX QUESTIONS INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT
                            ARMS CONTROL AND LAW OF SEA CONSIDERATIONS.</p>

                            INDICATED IN LAST YEAR'S 5TH COMMITTEE DEBATE THAT SHOULD IT BE
                            NECESSARY TO EXTEND THE FORCES BEYOND OCTOBER 31, 1975, THEY WOULD
                            REOPEN THE RESOLUTION'S FUNDING FORMULA TO INCREASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN

                            COUNCIL. THE US POSITION IS THAT THE PRESENT FUNDING FORMULA SHOULD BE
                            CONTINUED SINCE IT IS AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE WHICH BOTH RECOGNIZES THE

                            INCREASE OF ABOUT 33 PERCENT OVER 1974-75. GIVEN LDC DISSATISFACTION
                            WITH THE AMOUNTS BEING RETURNED TO THEM AND CONCERN AMONG DEVELOPED
                            NATIONS OVER THE HUGE INCREASES THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PAY, CAREFUL
                            SCRUTINY MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL PROPOSALS. EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
                            ECONOMIZE WHERE POSSIBLE AND TO PUT INTO EFFECT MEASURES WHICH WOULD
                            ASSURE THAT SUMS APPROVED PROVIDE FOR DELIVERY OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE
                            BENEFITS TO EACH MEMBER. WE WOULD HOPE THAT EACH NATION WOULD FOCUS ON
                            THE BUDGET IN TERMS OF COST EFFECTIVENESS AND INSTRUCT THEIR DELEGATIONS
                            TO SUPPORT ONLY THOSE ITEMS WHICH IT DEEMS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER THAT
                            INCREASES MAY BE HELD TO A MINIMUM. SUPPORT OF ANY SUCH NEW ESSENTIAL
                            ITEMS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE ELIMINATION OF LESS ESSENTIAL ITEMS.

                            <lb/>FROM: <persName corresp="#p_BMH1">MALCOLM BUTLER</persName>
                            <lb/>SUBJECT: President's Meeting with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MDP1">Moynihan</persName>, 2:00 p.m., Wednesday, August
                            27, 1975</p>
                        <p>I understand this meeting was originally scheduled as a pro forma
                            appointment for a new ambassador with the President, but there are
                            additional items of which you should be aware. First, following the
                            August 9 <gloss target="#t_EPB1">EPB</gloss> meeting on European
                            economic issues, <persName corresp="#p_DJT2">John Dunlop</persName>
                            proposed that a working group on these issues be formed. The President
                            has now approved this proposal, and it was "suggested" that Moynihan be
                            added to the group (memo at Tab A). It is not clear who in the White
                            House urged his inclusion in the working group; Moynihan is not an
                            expert on European affairs, and his responsibilities at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will continue to focus heavily on US
                            relations with the developing countries. <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Bob
                                Hormats</persName> has sent you his own ideas on the issues which
                            this working group could fruitfully address (memo at Tab B).</p>
                        <p>Second, Moynihan may use the meeting with the President to emphasize the
                            importance of the initiatives which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> will announce in his address
                            at the Seventh Special Session. Obviously we agree that these
                            initiatives are important, but you should also be aware that Moynihan’s
                            personal priorities may be different from those of the Secretary. We may
                            wish to make our own points in support of the two proposals with
                            budgetary implications which have not yet received Presidential
                            approval. (<gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> is currently preparing a
                            memo to the President on these items.) For your information, these items
                            are:</p>
                        <p>--International Fund for Agricultural Development (<gloss
                                target="#t_IFAD1">IFAD</gloss>)--OMB's budgetary concern--outlays of
                            $5 million in 1976 and $30 million in 1977--should not be allowed to
                            block this initiative. It has strong Congressional support, and it
                            represents an important joint undertaking with the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries. (They would contribute
                            $600 million compared to our $200 million.)</p>
                        <p>--Tin Agreement--The EPB/<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> task force
                            on commodities has concluded that the international tin agreement has no
                            significant economic costs or benefits. The political advantages of
                            participating, however, would be enormous in that it will demonstrate
                            that our willingness to review commodity agreements case-by-case is not
                            a hollow promise.</p>
                        <p>--International Finance Corporation (<gloss target="#t_IFC1"
                            >IFC</gloss>)--An increase of the IFC’s paid in capital would allow it
                            to play a catalytic role within the World Bank Group in emphasizing
                            private enterprise, particularly in the development of mineral
                            resources. This would cost nothing in 1976 and only $33-42 million in
                            1977.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it may be that Moynihan will take this opportunity to bring
                            before the President his personal views on our UN strategy; these are
                            occasionally somewhat harder line than those of the Secretary. Moynihan
                            has, for example, urged stronger retaliation against those not voting
                            with us in the UN than the Secretary has been willing to approve; the
                            Puerto Rico vote is an example. He also seems to be looking anxiously
                            for an opportunity to express the hard-hitting "loyal opposition" theme
                            of this Commentary article, and the Secretary has pulled him back; the
                            Vietnam-Korea issue was not the appropriate vehicle. In general,
                            Moynihan tends to see things more in a black-and-white,
                            with-us-or-against-us fashion than in the Secretary's multidimensional,
                            shades-of-grey framework. It is important, therefore, that the President
                            stress that Moynihan's original and creative thinking be carefully
                            coordinated with the Secretary's policy thrust.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION <lb/>That you forward the Presidential talker at Tab
                            I.</p>

                            The press left. ]</p>
                        <p>President: I have this practice of having new Cabinet officers in after a
                            month or so to see how they like the job, what the problems are, extras,
                            etc. I read your paper last night on how bilateral ambassadors can help
                            in multilateral organizations. In Congress, with the new electronic
                            tally, we keep a scorecard on how people vote. Your paper strikes me as
                            a device which could be employed. State should keep a tally on how
                            individual countries vote.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: The payroll is computerized, but there is no way to find out
                            how Japan voted in the UN over the past 30 years except manually.</p>
                        <p>President: State should do something like that.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: You will be presiding through a more difficult time than your
                            predecessor. It will be a world where more and more don't like us. I
                            think this does not result from specific actions, but has been in
                            process for 50 years. Early in the 20th Century, America--and the
                            world--saw American institutions as those toward which the world was
                            heading.</p>
                        <p>This feeling peaked out in 1919, when Wilson had enormous world prestige.
                            At that time came the Soviet Communist government, and it before too
                            long was viewed as the wave of the future. Then, after World War II,
                            there was a third manifestation -- the new socialist tradition of the
                            emerging Third World. This bunch is anti-American, just by nature.</p>
                        <p>The success-of Soviet arms in the world is tending the world against the
                            western democracies. We get beat.</p>
                        <p>For the last decade and for the next generation, the U.S. will be a
                            beleaguered garrison in international forums. This is a fact. It will
                            have consequences; we will look like losers. We will lose the Korean UN
                            forces vote. The Third World finds it can impose things by bloc voting
                            in multilateral forums.</p>
                        <p>There is much talk about U.S. companies influencing and controlling
                            foreign governments. Nonsense! But we will find U.S. companies trying to
                            influence the U.S. government on behalf of foreign governments.</p>
                        <p>How do nonaligned vote on Law of the Seas, nuclear energy, etc? Most of
                            the votes go against us. How could we do better?</p>
                        <p>We don't know how to translate multilateral issues into bilateral issues.
                            State is endemically bilaterally oriented. So there are countries which
                            are sworn enemies in multilateral forums and who are still beneficiaries
                            of enormous U.S. favors.</p>
                        <p>Cuba tries to clobber us on Puerto Rico in the UN. We beat it down in the
                            UN and next day we lift the embargo on Cuba. One hand knows not what the
                            other is doing. What do we do about all this? Maybe for certain
                            countries we should say our multilateral relations are more important
                            than our bilateral ones. We in the Mission made up a list and eliminated
                            those with whom we had substantial trade, investment, etc. That left us
                            with 74 countries. Some of these were important to us for other reasons,
                            leaving a net of 64 -- one-half of the world. In those countries, the
                            multilateral relations are most important.</p>
                        <p>We must start being harder on the weak than the strong. We must play hard
                            ball.</p>
                        <p>That is my story.</p>
                        <p>President: How soon can we start?</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: In a month if you want to.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Service is a first-rate bunch. They will do what they are
                            told, but they have never been told.</p>
                        <p>President: This fits into my philosophy. Kissinger hasn't talked to me
                            about it.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: He read my paper just before he left. I am sure he will want to
                            discuss it with you.</p>
                        <p>President: I am attracted to the idea. [To General <persName

                            Kissinger. I know this system worked in the Congress. I like the
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: These countries need us. We feed a lot of them. </p>
                        <p>President: How are your people?</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: I have first-rate people: for example, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAWJB1">Sherer</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GL2"

                        <p>President: The Congress? </p>
                        <p>Moynihan: <persName corresp="#p_FDMK1">Fraser</persName> and Burke.</p>
                        <p>President: Burke is an old duck. Fraser is way out, but I think he may be
                            coming round a bit.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: There is nothing like exposure to others pissing on your
                            country. It should help him along.</p>
                        <p>Anything special you are concerned about? That are your special
                            problems?</p>
                        <p>President: No, but if anything develops, you will hear about them. We
                            will support you.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: The only thing I ask is to see you from time to time. Contact
                            with the President is what counts.</p>
                        <p>President: You can drop in with Kissinger after Cabinet meetings from
                            time to time.</p>

                        <p>August 27, 1975</p>
                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>The 7th Special Session of the UN General Assembly on economic
                            cooperation and development that convenes in New York on September 1
                            will provide an opportunity to reverse the pattern of increasing
                            confrontation between developing and developed countries that has marked
                            major international gatherings on economic issues in the last several
                            years. Failure of the session to produce even limited agreements on
                            issues of importance to the developing states may aggravate the
                            political atmosphere at the regular General Assembly. An abortive
                            Special Session will not only affect the outcome of such issues as the
                            suspension of Israel, but would damage prospects for subsequent, smaller
                            international discussions where the developed countries hope to work out
                            realistic policies on a broad range of issues.</p>
                        <p>Preparations for the Special Session have been under way for the past
                            year with states on all sides working to coordinate positions. The
                            developed countries have concentrated on finding ways to respond to some
                            of the demands put forward by the developing states, while holding the
                            line against costly concessions. These efforts have probably produced a
                            measure of better mutual understanding, but the lack of real progress
                            indicates that a consensus has yet to be reached on the fundamental
                            question of transfer of resources from the wealthy states to the
                            poor.</p>
                        <p>Radicals among the poor insist that what they want is a larger share of
                            the world product. Others among the poor agree with the rich, for the
                            most part, that sustained growth is the best guarantee the poor have of
                            developing their economies. The tone of the Special Session will largely
                            depend on the outcome of the meeting of the nonaligned foreign ministers
                            in Lima--which opened August 25. More than eighty participants and over
                            twenty observers are attending the Lima conference where some developing
                            countries may press for endorsement of "extreme" demands.</p>
                        <p>Under the leadership of Algeria, the nonaligned movement has in recent
                            years become increasingly preoccupied with economic issues. Looming
                            large at the Lima meeting will be the need to reach agreement on a
                            common front for the 7th Special Session. If the nonaligned nations are
                            able to agree on a common position in Lima, they will almost certainly
                            not break solidarity at the UN session--even if the industrialized
                            states subsequently present proposals otherwise acceptable to many of
                            the developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Prospects now appear to be somewhat brighter than earlier this year that
                            the nonaligned may adopt a less belligerent line at Lima. At last
                            month's meeting in Geneva of the UN's Economic and Social Council, those
                            developing countries who have generally avoided rhetorical excesses were
                            able to exert some influence over the policy of the developing-country
                            caucus. The conciliatory atmosphere was maintained in a meeting of the
                            Trade Development Board of <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> in
                            the week following <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and at the
                            third meeting of the preparatory conference for the Special Session,
                            which opened August 18. In fact, delegates to the latter meeting elected
                            to extend the conference into the following week, so as to coincide with
                            the Lima conference. This move may undercut attempts by states such as
                            Algeria to use the Lima session to pick a fight with the industrialized
                            states on issues related to the 7th Special Session. Nevertheless the
                            Algerians should not be underestimated. In informal sessions at ECOSOC
                            the radicals, led by Algeria, were uncompromising, and most of the less
                            extreme developing states remain skeptical of their ability to moderate
                            the deliberations in Lima.</p>
                        <p>A successful session--in the view of most industrialized states and the
                            majority of developing states--would set a constructive tone for
                            subsequent agreement on at least some contentious issues in other, more
                            restricted forums. Few countries, in fact, expect substantive
                            negotiations to take place during the Special Session, but most realize
                            that a major determinant of any future negotiations will be the
                            atmosphere created in New York.</p>
                        <p>If the voices for negotiation rather than confrontation among the
                            developing states are to retain what little influence they have and the
                            developing-country caucus is to be persuaded of the value of dialogue,
                            the industrialized nations will probably have to make
                            concessions--perhaps in the commodities field.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of what the developing countries take to be serious
                            discussions of economic issues, the solidarity of the developing states
                            will be reinforced, and they are likely to vent their frustrations by
                            initiating political resolutions or pushing for UN structural
                            changes.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets and East Europeans--with the exception of Romania and
                            Yugoslavia--will maintain a low profile at the 7th Special Session, as
                            they have at previous meetings dealing with these issues. They will
                            express solidarity with the developing states but will also be careful
                            to avoid costly economic commitments. The Chinese, for their part, will
                            be a strong supporter of the developing countries' positions, but they
                            will not assume a leadership position. Peking will also certainly use
                            the session to continue its attacks on the Soviets.</p>

                        <p>2. CHIEFS OF MISSION ARE URGENTLY REQUESTED TO DELIVER COPIES OF THE
                            SECRETARY'S SPEECH TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF HOST
                            GOVERNMENTS. IN DOING SO, UNLESS THEY SEE REASONS DICTATING OTHERWISE,
                            IT IS SUGGESTED THEY HIGHLIGHT THE POINTS OUTLINED BELOW, WHILE BEING
                            FREE TO DRAW UPON ANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SECRETARY'S SPEECH WHICH THEY
                            FEEL WOULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO EMPHASIZE IN EACH CASE.</p>
                        <p>3. YOU SHOULD STRESS THAT THE SECRETARY'S SPEECH REPRESENTS AN
                            EXTRAORDINARY INITIATIVE BY THE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> TO
                            PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE, PRACTICABLE AND SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE TO
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> DEVELOPMENTAL AND EMERGENCY
                            NEEDS. IT IS A SINCERE EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE
                            LEADING TO CONCRETE SOLUTIONS OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS, WHILE TURNING AWAY
                            FROM CONFRONTATION OVER BROAD, RHETORICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES. WE
                            HAVE HEARD LDC CONCERNS AND ASPIRATIONS. NOW WE MUST BEGIN CONSTRUCTIVE
                            COOPERATION IN REACHING MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS WHEREVER THESE ARE
                            ATTAINABLE.</p>
                        <p>4. WE WANT HOST GOVERNMENTS TO APPRECIATE THAT THE USG LOOKS FORWARD TO
                            SERIOUS AND CONTINUING EFFORT TO WORK OUT THE TYPE OF MEASURES WHICH WE
                            BELIEVE, AS INDICATED IN SECRETARY'S SPEECH, WILL BRING SUBSTANTIAL
                            BENEFITS. VIEWED IN THIS LIGHT, DEMARCHES ARE NOT REQUESTS FOR IMMEDIATE
                            OR SPECIFIC SUPPORT OR ENDORSEMENT BY HOST GOVERNMENTS FOR PARTICULAR
                            PROPOSALS. THESE WILL NATURALLY HAVE TO BE STUDIED CAREFULLY OVER TIME
                            AND BE WORKED ON IN MANY FORUMS. DEMARCHES SHOULD INSTEAD BE VIEWED AS
                            CALLS FOR BEGINNING A NEW PROCESS OF COOPERATION. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT
                            NOW MAKING ANY SPECIFIC REQUESTS, WE WOULD OF COURSE WELCOME IT IF LDC
                            HOST GOVERNMENTS BEGINNING THIS PROCESS OF SERIOUS STUDY AND DIALOGUE
                            WITH US SAW FIT TO PROVIDE GENERAL GUIDANCE TO DELEGATIONS IN NEW YORK
                            IN FAVOR OF SEARCHING FOR A MORE COOPERATIVE APPROACH THAN HAS EXISTED
                            IN THE PAST AND IN FAVOR OF ENCOURAGEMENT OF SERIOUS WORK IN AREAS WHERE
                            CONCRETE GAINS MAY BE POSSIBLE.</p>
                        <p>5. SUMMARY OF THE SECRETARY'S SPEECH FOLLOWS.</p>
                        <p>6. THE U.S. HAS MADE A MAJOR EFFORT, IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS OF
                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TO FORMULATE A PROGRAM OF PRACTICAL STEPS FOR
                            INTERNATIONAL ACTION; WE ARE PREPARED TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF
                            OTHERS; AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO A CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORT. HOWEVER, WHILE
                            THE WORLD HAS THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE A TOLERABLE STANDARD OF
                            LIFE FOR ITS PEOPLE, ECONOMIC ISSUES BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED
                            COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MOUNTING CONFRONTATIONS WHICH COULD
                            RESULT IN HARDENING BLOCS AND DIVISIONS THAT WOULD UNDERMINE COOPERATION
                            AND DEVELOPMENT--A SITUATION FOR WHICH THE LDC'S WOULD PAY THE GREATER
                            COST. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE WORLD ECONOMY IS A SINGLE GLOBAL
                            SYSTEM OF TRADE AND MONETARY RELATIONS ON WHICH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL
                            ECONOMIES HINGES, SO THAT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES SHOULD UNITE RATHER THAN
                            DIVIDE.</p>
                        <p>7. THE ASSEMBLED NATIONS HAVE THE CHOICE OF OFFERING THEIR PEOPLE SLOGANS
                            OR SOLUTIONS, OF DEALING IN RHETORIC OR REALITY. WE MUST GET DOWN TO
                            BUSINESS AND PUT ASIDE THE STERILE DEBATE OVER WHETHER A NEW ECONOMIC
                            ORDER IS REQUIRED OR WHETHER THE OLD ECONOMIC ORDER IS ADEQUATE. THERE
                            MUST BE CONSENSUS, WITHOUT WHICH WE WILL ACHIEVE NOTHING--A CONSENSUS
                            ACKNOWLEDGING OUR RESPECTIVE CONCERNS AND MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND THAT
                            ALL OF US HAVE RIGHTS AND DUTIES; A CONSENSUS EMBRACING THE ROLE AND
                            VOICE OF THE LDC'S IN DECISIONS AFFECTING THEM AND A COMMENSURATE VOICE
                            FOR THOSE WHO ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND EFFORT.</p>
                        <p>8. THE U.S. OFFERS CONCRETE PROPOSALS FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTION TO PROMOTE
                            LDC DEVELOPMENT, GROUPED IN FIVE FUNDAMENTAL AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT
                            STRATEGY: BASIC ECONOMIC SECURITY, ACCELERATED GROWTH, TRADE,
                            COMMODITIES, AND THE NEEDS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES, ADDING AT THE END
                            THE POLITICAL DIMENSION OF DECISION-MAKING AND STRUCTURAL REFORM. THE
                            FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THESE PROPOSALS (NUMBERING OVER THIRTY PROPOSALS
                            AND STATEMENTS OF NEW POLICY):</p>
                        <p>A. ECONOMIC SECURITY</p>
                        <p>OUR FIRST TASK IS TO ENSURE BASIC ECONOMIC SECURITY IN THE FACE OF
                            DAMAGING SHOCKS AND CYCLES. DEVELOPING ECONOMIES ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE
                            TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INCLUDING SHARP INCREASES IN THE
                            PRICE OF OIL AND FOOD, AND RECESSION IN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES. </p>
                        <p>1) THE U.S. HAS SUPPORTED THE PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF INDUSTRIALIZED,
                            OIL PRODUCING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO RE-LAUNCH A DIALOGUE ON
                            PROBLEMS OF ENERGY, DEVELOPMENT, RAW MATERIALS AND RELATED FINANCIAL
                            ISSUES. ARBITRARY INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OIL HAVE SHATTERED THE
                            ECONOMIC PLANNING AND PROGRESS OF MANY NATIONS AND ANOTHER INCREASE
                            COULD SLOW DOWN OR REVERSE THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>2) THE MAJOR U.S. PROPOSAL IN MEETING THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF FLUCTUATIONS
                            AND SHORTFALLS IN LDC EXPORT EARNINGS IS TO ESTABLISH A NEW DEVELOPMENT
                            SECURITY FACILITY WITHIN THE <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> TO
                            STABILIZE OVERALL EXPORT EARNINGS. ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES COULD DRAW MOST OR
                            UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ALL OF THEIR IMF QUOTAS, IN ADDITION TO
                            THEIR NORMAL DRAWING RIGHTS. THE FACILITY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IT COULD LOAN UP TO $2.5 BILLION, OR MORE, IN A
                            SINGLE YEAR AND A POTENTIAL TOTAL OF $10 BILLION IN LOANS OUTSTANDING.
                            THE POOREST COUNTRIES COULD, UNDER PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS, CONVERT LOANS
                            FROM THE FACILITY INTO GRANTS THROUGH THE NEW IMF TRUST FUND. THE
                            DEVELOPMENT SECURITY FACILITY WOULD REPLACE THE IMF'S COMPENSATORY
                            FINANCING FACILITY.</p>
                        <p>B. ACCELERATING ECONOMIC GROWTH</p>
                        <p>THIS IS A PROCESS REQUIRING THE INFUSION OF CAPITAL, TECHNOLOGY AND
                            MANAGERIAL SKILLS ON A MASSIVE SCALE, BOTH FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE
                            SOURCES.</p>
                        <p>1) TO IMPROVE LDC ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS: (A) THE U.S. AND OTHER DC'S
                            ARE JOINING IN A $6 BILLION EXPANSION OF THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT
                            BANK; THE U.S. WILL PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE REPLENISHMENT OF
                            THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK; AND WE ARE SEEKING CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY
                            TO JOIN THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND. (B) THE U.S. WILL SUPPORT A MAJOR
                            EXPANSION OF THE WORLD BANK'S INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION (<gloss
                                target="#t_IFC1">IFC</gloss>) FROM A PRESENT LEVEL OF $100 MILLION
                            TO AT LEAST $400 MILLION. (C) THE U.S. PROPOSES THE CREATION OF AN
                            INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT TRUST MANAGED BY THE IFC TO CHANNEL PUBLIC AND
                            PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT INTO LDC PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND MIXED
                            ENTERPRISES. (D) THE U.S. WILL CONTRIBUTE ACTIVELY TO THE WORK OF THE
                            IMF/WORLD BANK DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP OTHER MEASURES TO
                            IMPROVE LDC ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.</p>
                        <p>2) PRIORITY AREAS FOR THE TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT ARE:
                            ENERGY, FOOD, OTHER RESOURCES, AND INDUSTRIALIZATION. ENERGY
                            REQUIREMENTS ARE CRITICAL. THE ENORMOUS RISE IN THE COST OF OIL IN THE
                            LAST TWO YEARS HAS MORE THAN WIPED OUT THE TOTAL FOREIGN AID RECEIVED BY
                            LDC'S. (A) THE U.S. INVITES OTHER NATIONS TO JOIN US IN INCREASED
                            BILATERAL SUPPORT FOR TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP LDC'S
                            DEVELOP NEW SOURCES OF FUEL AND ENERGY; WE WILL PROPOSE THE CREATION OF
                            AN INTERNATIONAL ENERGY INSTITUTE TO BRING TOGETHER DC'S, LDC'S,
                            CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS ON THE PROBLEM OF ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. (B) THE
                            U.S. IS PREPARED TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THE VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL
                            AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTERS AND THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP FOR
                            INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH; AND WE ARE SUPPORTING LEGISLATION
                            TO ENABLE OUR UNIVERSITIES TO EXPAND THEIR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND
                            RESEARCH IN AGRICULTURE. (C) THE U.S. PROPOSES THE CREATION OF A
                            CONSORTIUM TO COORDINATE AND FINANCE ASSISTANCE IN IMPROVING THE
                            PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF NON-FOOD AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY
                            PRODUCTS. (D) THE U.S. SUPPORTS THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL
                            INDUSTRIALIZATION INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY AND AN
                            INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR THE EXCHANGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION; WE
                            WILL EXPAND OUR BILATERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE AREA OF INDUSTRIAL
                            TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY SUITED TO LDC NEEDS; AND WE WILL WORK WITH OTHER
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> MEMBERS IN PREPARING GUIDELINES
                            FOR THE TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY.</p>
                        <p>3) TRANSNATIONAL ENTERPRISES HAVE BEEN POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS OF
                            MODERNIZATION; THE WORLD COMMUNITY CANNOT AFFORD TO TREAT THEM AS
                            OBJECTS OF ECONOMIC WARFARE; IF NATIONS CANNOT REACH A CONSENSUS ON
                            THEIR ROLE, LDC'S WILL LOSE AN INVALUABLE ASSET. (A) THE U.S. BELIEVES
                            THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD DEVELOP STANDARDS OF CONDUCT FOR BOTH
                            TNE'S AND GOVERNMENTS, WHICH THE UN COMMISSION ON TRANSNATIONAL
                            CORPORATIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES HAVE BEGUN TO DO. TNE'S
                            SHOULD OBEY LOCAL LAW; REFRAIN FROM UNLAWFUL INTERVENTION; TAKE ACCOUNT
                            OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES; RESPECT LOCAL CULTURE; AND EMPLOY
                            AND TRAIN LOCAL PERSONNEL. HOST GOVERNMENTS SHOULD TREAT TNE'S
                            EQUITABLY, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION AMONG THEM AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
                            INTERNATIONAL LAW; AND SHOULD MAKE EXPLICIT THEIR DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
                            AND STANDARDS FOR TNE'S AND MAINTAIN THEM WITH REASONABLE CONSISTENCY.
                            BOTH TNE'S AND GOVERNMENTS SHOULD RESPECT THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
                            THEY FREELY UNDERTAKE. PRINCIPLES SHOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO DOMESTIC
                            ENTERPRISES--WITH SPECIFICALLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS--AND TO PRIVATE, STATE
                            AND MIXED ENTERPRISES. (B) ADDITIONALLY, WE SHOULD DEVELOP OTHER WAYS OF
                            RESOLVING THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING TNE'S, SUCH AS HARMONIZING TAX
                            TREATMENT, FACT-FINDING AND ARBITRAL PROCEDURES, LAWS AGAINST
                            RESTRICTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES, MULTILATERALIZED INSURANCE FOR FOREIGN
                            INVESTMENT, AND MORE EFFECTIVE BILATERAL CONSULTATION.</p>

                            IN GENEVA ARE CENTRAL TO MAKING THE TRADING SYSTEM BETTER SERVE
                            DEVELOPMENT GOALS.</p>
                        <p>1) LDC'S IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT SHOULD RECEIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT,
                            BUT AS THEY PROGRESS THEY SHOULD GRADUALLY ASSUME THE SAME OBLIGATIONS
                            OF RECIPROCITY AS OTHER COUNTRIES AND AT SOME POINT BE PREPARED TO
                            COMPETE ON MORE EQUAL TERMS.</p>
                        <p>2) WE MUST IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR OF LDC'S.
                            TO THIS END THE U.S. WILL PUT INTO EFFECT ITS GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF
                            PREFERENCES ON JANUARY 1, 1976, AND BEFORE THEN WILL CONSULT WITH
                            EXPORTING LDC'S ON HOW TO BENEFIT FROM THESE OPPORTUNITIES.</p>
                        <p>3) IN ORDER TO ADAPT RULES ON NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO LDC NEEDS, THE U.S.
                            WILL NEGOTIATE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR LDC'S IN SETTING STANDARDS FOR
                            GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT; AND WILL ALSO NEGOTIATE ON THE BASIS THAT, UNDER
                            PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS, CERTAIN SUBSIDIES WILL NOT TRIGGER COUNTERVAILING
                            DUTIES FOR A PERIOD GEARED TO ACHIEVING PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT
                            OBJECTIVES.</p>
                        <p>4) WE WILL WORK TOWARD EARLY AGREEMENT IN THE MTN ON LOWERING TARIFFS ON
                            TROPICAL PRODUCTS.</p>
                        <p>5) IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES THAT FAVORS
                            THE IMPORT OF RAW MATERIALS OVER OTHER GOODS, THE U.S. WILL GIVE HIGH
                            PRIORITY IN THE GENEVA MTN TO REDUCING TARIFFS ON MANUFACTURES AND
                            PROCESSED GOODS SO AS TO ENCOURAGE THESE INDUSTRIES IN LDC'S. </p>
                        <p>6) ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING LDC'S HAVE AN OBLIGATION NOT TO ARBITRARILY
                            WITHHOLD NORMAL EXPORTS, THUS DISRUPTING OTHER ECONOMIES. WE URGE
                            NEGOTIATIONS TO LIMIT AND GOVERN THE USE OF EXPORT RESTRAINTS; AND THE
                            U.S. WILL JOIN OTHERS IN NEGOTIATING SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO GUARANTEE
                            THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMODITIES THAT WE EXPORT AS PART OF THE RECIPROCAL
                            EXCHANGE OF CONCESSIONS.</p>
                        <p>D. COMMODITIES</p>
                        <p>BOTH LDC'S AND DC'S WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE STABLE CONDITIONS OF TRADE
                            AND EXPANDED PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IN TRADE, DC'S BEING THE LARGEST
                            EXPORTERS OF FOOD AND MOST MINERALS.</p>
                        <p>1) THERE SHOULD BE A GLOBAL APPROACH TO THE VITAL PROBLEM OF FOOD
                            SECURITY. THE U.S. DECLARES THAT IT IS TIME TO CREATE THE INTERNATIONAL
                            SYSTEM OF NATIONALLY HELD GRAIN RESERVES PROPOSED AT THE WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE. TO MEET POTENTIAL SHORTFALLS, TOTAL RESERVES MUST REACH 30
                            MILLION TONS OF WHEAT AND RICE, AND THE ADDITION OF COARSE GRAINS SHOULD
                            BE CONSIDERED; RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOLDING RESERVES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED
                            FAIRLY, AND THE U.S. IS PREPARED TO HOLD A MAJOR SHARE; ACQUISITION AND
                            RELEASE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS; FULL PARTICIPANTS
                            SHOULD RECEIVE ASSURED ACCESS; AND SPECIAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE EXTENDED
                            TO PARTICIPATING LDC'S TO ENABLE THEM TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO HOLD
                            RESERVES.</p>
                        <p>2) THE SAME COOPERATIVE APPROACH SHOULD BE APPLIED TO OTHER PRIMARY
                            COMMODITIES BESET BY FLUCTUATIONS BUT, SINCE NO SIMPLE FORMULA CAN APPLY
                            EQUALLY TO ALL, THE U.S. PROPOSES TO DISCUSS NEW ARRANGEMENTS ON A
                            CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE IN MANY CASES WILL BE
                            THROUGH BUFFER STOCKS. PRICE FIXING AND RESTRICTED PRODUCTION WOULD
                            RESULT IN DISTORTIONS AND DISLOCATIONS. (A) THE U.S. RECOMMENDS THAT
                            CONSUMER-PRODUCER FORUMS BE ESTABLISHED FOR EVERY KEY COMMODITY TO
                            PROMOTE THE EFFICIENCY, GROWTH AND STABILITY OF ITS MARKET, WITH
                            PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR GRAINS AND COPPER. THE U.S. INTENDS TO SIGN
                            THE TIN AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL CONSULTATIONS AND
                            RATIFICATION; WE ARE PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY IN NEGOTIATIONS ON COFFEE IN
                            HOPES OF A SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT; AND WE WILL ALSO JOIN IN THE
                            FORTHCOMING COCOA AND SUGAR NEGOTIATIONS. (B) THE U.S. WILL SUPPORT
                            LIBERALIZATION OF THE IMF'S FINANCING OF BUFFER STOCKS, TO ASSURE THAT
                            THIS FACILITY IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT REDUCING OTHER DRAWING RIGHTS.</p>
                        <p>3) TO EXPAND WORLDWIDE CAPACITY IN MINERALS AND OTHER CRITICAL RAW
                            MATERIALS, (A) THE U.S. PROPOSES A MAJOR ROLE FOR THE WORLD BANK GROUP,
                            IN CONCERT WITH PRIVATE SOURCES, IN DEVELOPING RAW MATERIAL RESOURCES IN
                            LDC'S, FOR WHICH $2 BILLION IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL SHOULD BE THE
                            TARGET; AND (B) THE U.S. WILL CONTRIBUTE TO AND ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE NEW
                            UN REVOLVING FUND FOR NATURAL RESOURCES EXPLORATION AND
                            EXPLOITATION.</p>
                        <p>E. POOREST NATIONS</p>
                        <p>THE CHALLENGE OF ONE BILLION PEOPLE ON THE MARGIN OF EXISTENCE MUST BE
                            MET BY PROVIDING ELEMENTAL ECONOMIC SECURITY, IMMEDIATE RELIEF, AND
                            PREFERENCE FOR THEIR NEEDS FOR FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH. POOREST COUNTRIES
                            HAVE BEEN MOST CRUELLY AFFECTED BY THE RISE IN COST OF OIL, FOOD AND
                            OTHER IMPORTS.</p>
                        <p>1) TO PROVIDE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SUPPORT FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES
                            DURING PERIODS OF ADVERSITY, THE U.S. LAST NOVEMBER PROPOSED A TRUST
                            FUND IN THE IMF OF UP TO $2 BILLION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF, AND WILL PRESS
                            THIS PROPOSAL IN THE IMF MEETINGS NOW UNDERWAY.</p>
                        <p>2) THE U.S. PROPOSAL FOR A NEW IMF DEVELOPMENT SECURITY FACILITY CAN
                            PROVIDE MAJOR NEW ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THE POOREST.</p>
                        <p>3) THE U.S. FOOD AID BUDGET PROVIDES ALMOST SIX MILLION TONS OF
                            FOOD-GRAINS THIS FISCAL YEAR,--I.E., ROUGHLY 60 PER CENT OF THE WORLD
                            FOOD CONFERENCE TARGET OF 10 MILLION TONS ANNUALLY AND A 20 PER CENT
                            INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR.</p>
                        <p>4) WE URGE THAT THE <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>, IN CONJUNCTION
                            WITH THE <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss> AND WORLD BANK, DEVELOP A
                            COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO CUT IN HALF BY 1985 POST-HARVEST LOSSES IN THE
                            POOREST COUNTRIES, E.G., THROUGH BETTER STORAGE AND PESTICIDES. </p>
                        <p>5) THE U.S. WILL SUPPORT A MAJOR EXPANSION IN PRESENT EFFORTS, IN
                            COOPERATION WITH <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, TO DEVELOP
                            COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICES, COMBINING HEALTH, FAMILY
                            PLANNING AND NUTRITIONAL SERVICES AND INFORMATION.</p>
                        <p>6) POOREST COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE PREFERENTIAL ACCESS TO OFFICIAL,
                            CONCESSIONARY FINANCIAL AID. THERE SHOULD BE EXPANDED LOW-INTEREST LOANS
                            BY THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO THE POOREST COUNTRIES.
                            THE U.S. WILL JOIN OTHERS IN A SUBSTANTIAL FIFTH REPLENISHMENT OF THE
                                <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> FOR THIS PURPOSE PROVIDED OIL
                            EXPORTING COUNTRIES MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION.</p>
                        <p>7) TO CONTRIBUTE TO A MASSIVE INCREASE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY THE
                            POOREST COUNTRIES, THE USG IS ASKING CONGRESS FOR AUTHORIZATION TO
                            DOUBLE ITS BILATERAL AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE TO $582 MILLION, AND WE
                            URGE OTHERS TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.</p>
                        <p>8) THE U.S. PROPOSES THE EARLY ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL
                            FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (<gloss target="#t_IFAD1"
                            >IFAD</gloss>) AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF CAPITAL TO MEET THE CRITICAL
                            PROBLEMS OF THE POOREST LDC'S. THE USG WILL SEEK AUTHORIZATION FOR A
                            DIRECT CONTRIBUTION OF $200 MILLION, PROVIDED OTHERS WILL LEND THEIR
                            SUPPORT FOR A COMBINED GOAL OF AT LEAST $1 BILLION.</p>
                        <p>F. POLITICAL DIMENSION</p>
                        <p>1) RESPONDING TO LDC DESIRES FOR A GREATER VOICE IN DECISIONS AFFECTING
                            THEM, THE U.S. BELIEVES PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL DECISION-MAKING
                            MUST BE WIDELY SHARED AND THAT THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING SHOULD BE
                            FAIR, REALISTIC, RESPONSIVE TO CHANGE, AND TAILORED TO THE ISSUES AT
                            HAND.</p>
                        <p>2) WITH RESPECT TO IMPROVING THE UN MACHINERY IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
                            SECTORS, THE U.S. WELCOMES THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S GROUP
                            OF 25 EXPERT ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND WILL CONSIDER VERY SERIOUSLY ITS
                            RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR VIEW IS THAT IMPROVEMENTS SHOULD INCLUDE
                            RATIONALIZATION OF THE UN'S FRAGMENTED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, STRENGTHENED
                            LEADERSHIP, STREAMLINING <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>,
                            BETTER CONSULTATIVE PROCEDURES, AND A MECHANISM FOR INDEPENDENT PROGRAM
                            EVALUATION. THE U.S. PROPOSES THAT THE SPECIAL SESSION FORM AN
                            INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE TO BEGIN WORK IMMEDIATELY ON RECOMMENDATIONS
                            TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE GA IN ITS 1976 SESSION. <persName

                        <p>Organizing for “Multilateral” Diplomacy</p>
                        <p>Adopting a Multilateral Approach</p>
                        <p>In his paper, “Bilateral Trends and Multilateral Realities,” Ambassador
                            Moynihan points out that we are taking a beating in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and related international bodies as well
                            as at important international conferences. He observes that this
                            situation is not only harming our interests but sometimes makes nonsense
                            of serious efforts to deal with important international issues. It also
                            risks undermining Congressional and public support for the UN and
                            international conferences on acute world problems. This situation has
                            resulted not only from the hostility of communist, nonaligned and less
                            developed states but also from a simple failure to exert our diplomatic
                            influence. Moynihan believes we can most effectively come to grips with
                            this problem by giving our “multilateral” interests--specifically voting
                            patterns in the UN and other international bodies--priority over our
                            bilateral relations with those countries with which we have no
                            significant bilateral interests. He has identified 64 such countries.
                            Since these states provide the bulk of the votes against us in
                            international bodies, we should launch a powerful campaign to change the
                            way they are voting.</p>
                        <p>Problems of This Approach</p>
                        <p>While Moynihan’s ultimate objective will have no opposition in the
                            Department, strong disagreement will arise over our scope for exerting
                            greater influence and the means of implementing the new approach, both
                            in terms of our overseas diplomacy and of the institutional arrangements
                            in the Department to carry it out. There are a number of weaknesses to
                            the approach that will immediately be pointed out.</p>
                        <p>Countries where the bilateral relationship is insignificant are precisely
                            the countries where we will have the least potential to carry out a
                            policy of rewards and punishments. With no economic, political or
                            security ties, there is little or nothing we can offer by way of
                            inducement or threaten by way of punishment for the actions of those
                            countries in the UN. Even in the case of countries were we have an
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program, such a policy lacks
                            credibility. A country such as Mauritania, for instance, is completely
                            dependent on Libyan support and largely indifferent to our threats or
                            promises. In any case, an AID program can be cut off only once and, if
                            stopped, would probably make that country more hostile to us. Some AID
                            programs, as that with Mali, are for humanitarian purposes, such as to
                            limit mass starvation, and to withdraw them would probably be impossible
                            for domestic political reasons. Moreover, the US government is not
                            usually institutionally able to initiate an AID program (as a reward to
                            a compliant country) rapidly.</p>
                        <p>The countries at issue generally have little interest in international
                            problems, poor communications and an inadequate civil service;
                            consequently their UN ambassadors are largely on their own. Pressure in
                            capitals could have little or no impact.</p>
                        <p>A list of “multilateral” states will eventually become known; such a
                            classification might be considered second-rate status and as a result
                            reduce or destroy our influence there.</p>
                        <p>The major nonaligned states, and those with significant influence in
                            international organizations, are no “multilateral” ones. As a result of
                            the new approach we would find ourselves concentrating our pressure on
                            the 64 weakest and least influential states in the world. Many of these
                            countries are, moreover, apt to follow the lead of the major nonaligned
                            states rather than succumb to our pressure.</p>
                        <p>Reasons to Go Ahead</p>
                        <p>The points are generally valid as far as they go, and they ought to
                            caution us not to expect overnight miracles. But the arguments by no
                            means diminish the cardinal fact that the US is not without prestige and
                            influence in any country and that we have generally failed not only to
                            bring pressure to bear but even to make our position on international
                            issues known. Small influence or large, we must do what we can and there
                            is a lot more we can do.</p>
                        <p>The fact that we have no evident means of exerting pressure on a
                            nonaligned state, or may not wish to retaliate against unfriendly
                            behavior, is no reason not to inform the country that we deplore its
                            voting practices and that we intend to take this into account at any
                            time that the country may seek our support on any bilateral or
                            multilateral issues. In this connection, this new approach will force
                            the Department to think through a precise catalog of potential rewards
                            and punishments which can be resorted to if such were ever deemed
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>The situation the US faces, to reiterate, is a dangerous erosion of our
                            diplomatic position in the world. This is most acutely evident in
                            international forums, and we see Moynihan’s approach essentially as a
                            take-off point for launching a broad initiative to try to solve this
                            broader problem. Our strategy must be a comprehensive one and will have
                            to include Allies, friends, neutrals and nonaligned, both influential
                            and not. The immediate aim of this approach, however, should be to focus
                            on those nonaligned states where our bilateral interests are of minimal
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>There is a great deal the Department can do right away. Using our
                            computer capability, we should examine voting records (which we have
                            already begun to do) as a basis for our efforts. We should inform all
                            our ambassadors that issues in international forums are priority matters
                            and that they and their staffs must be prepared to give to these issues
                            whatever time and attention are necessary. We should then support our
                            embassies with full and timely information and instructions. We should
                            also raise these issues in Allied capitals and perhaps in multilateral
                            forums such as NATO; we should also instruct embassies throughout the
                            world to work with other friendly, especially NATO, embassies in our
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>From here on the problem will be more difficult. Producing a list of
                            countries and giving appropriate ambassadors full and timely
                            instructions will certainly help, but these steps will probably not
                            elicit the institutional and psychological changes needed in the
                            department if the new approach is to be effectively implemented. We will
                            face suspicion from the regional bureaus that their authority will be
                            undermined and we will encounter the long-standing lack of authority of
                            functional bureaus, in this case <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>.
                            There are various ways of restructuring the Department, from the
                            creation of a new bureau for “multilateral” affairs to reliance on
                            exhortation and periodic monitoring. (<gloss target="#t_SP2">S/P</gloss>
                            has already done a useful study of this issue; this paper is attached at
                            Tab 2.)</p>
                        <p>The Initial Step</p>
                        <p>We think it is best to proceed with a join memorandum from us describing
                            the proposal in general terms. We attach a draft memorandum for your
                            approval (Tab 1). With your authorization, we would raise with the
                            Assistant Secretaries, though only orally at this point, the proposed
                            list of countries which is attached for your information at Tab 3. We
                            think it would be unwise, given the danger of leaks, to include the list
                            of countries with the memo.</p>
                        <p>As soon as we have an agreed list, we will have to develop with the
                            bureaus more precise methods of implementing the concept—determining
                            what scope we have for greater diplomatic persuasion in each individual
                            case, how we can improve our “persuasion” of countries not on the list
                            (a factor that might otherwise be forgotten in the aftermath of our
                            emphasis on “multilateral” countries), and how we might work with
                            friendly third countries (for example, Britain, France and Germany) and
                            organizations (such as the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>At the same time, and perhaps of most importance, we will have to
                            determine what changes will have to be made in the organization of the
                            Department. While we do not yet see all of these clearly, it seems
                            evident that IO will have to bear the brunt of the responsibility. We
                            are inclined at the moment to think a new office under a strong director
                            should be established there for “multilateral relations.” It may even be
                            advisable to establish a new Deputy Assistant Secretary in IO to take
                            charge of this work. It would be understood that IO would also have a
                            watching brief for other countries whose support in international forums
                            is needed. Disagreements between IO and the geographic bureaus will have
                            to be referred to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. We do not
                            believe we should pull our “multilateral” countries out of the regional
                            bureaus, though we may later on consider, as S/P suggests in the
                            attached paper, the establishment of an office of “multilateral country”
                            affairs within <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We ourselves cannot agree on one key issue: the degree of IO’s control of
                            “multilateral” countries. Eagleburger believes that IO should have
                            complete authority on issues relating to multilateral forums though
                            clearing instructions with regional bureaus, while regional bureaus
                            would clear instructions on other matters with IO. He believes that
                            short of having such authority, IO would be unable to assert the control
                            necessary to achieve the objectives of the new approach. He knows that
                            you have doubts about developing a “superstructure” to handle this
                            approach. Perhaps they are justified, but he now feels strongly that
                            anything short of a substantial shift of the organizational center of
                            gravity will be doomed to failure. We have seen the building at work for
                            too long. Lord is less certain that such drastic surgery is necessary.
                            This, too, is an issue which will have to be thoroughly discussed with
                            the bureaus and worked out as we go along. In any case we would prefer
                            to wait to give you our final recommendations on all of these questions
                            until after we have explored them thoroughly with the Assistant
                            Secretaries.</p>
                        <p>Once the approach has been agreed on, we will have to work with the
                            bureaus to draft a telegram to all missions to inform them of the new
                            approach, how we intend to implement it and what the new additional
                            responsibilities of ambassadors will be in “multilateral” countries.</p>
                        <p>Should this approach prove successful, it could serve as a pilot project
                            for the Department in handling those other functional issues that are
                            going to be major elements of foreign affairs in the coming decades.</p>

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to the United Nations.]</p>
                        <p>Lopez: There is an increasing number of countries in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who are voting against you. Will it not
                            bring an end to your patience? I ask, because it seems to me something
                            must happen sooner or later.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Look at some of the new countries--Sao Tome, Cape Verde. There
                            they sit with an equal vote and are very susceptible to radical
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>President: And I guess they can be easily corrupted.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: They have little to discuss, so they attack the United States. It
                            is a conversation topic.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: And it's free. But we are beginning to keep a log of who talks
                            and votes against us. Some of these guys are amazing; <persName
                                corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> sat right here and in answer to
                            a question as to how to help get the right party elected in Angola, he
                            said: "You get them in power first, then we will hold the elections."
                            Then in his evening toast he blasted us for undemocratic practices.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: The fact is the UN standards are lowering every year. I suspect
                            sooner or later something will happen.</p>
                        <p>President: If the abuse continues to expand, I think Congress will react
                            adversely. They can deny money.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: Or force your withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>President: We have to keep a record so we can go to them and say we won't
                            take this abuse and have you come back bilaterally for help.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: It is popular to vote against you.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: But it will no longer be free.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: I hear they are thinking of expelling Chile from the UN. I'll find
                            out more this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: We will fight it. And South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: Even that?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I told the Africans we abhorred apartheid, but if it is done
                            for one reason one time, it can be done for another reason another
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: Even if they violate the Charter?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: You can argue Namibia, but not apartheid.</p>
                        <p>Lopez: I am glad to hear, privately, that you will not tolerate abuse
                            from the radicals. It looks bad for the moderates not to look as
                            good.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF STATE<lb/>WASHINGTON</p>
                        <p>October 16, 1975</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR ALL REGIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARIES</p>
                        <p>Subject: U.S. Position in International Organizations</p>
                        <p>An increasing share of American foreign policy is being conducted in
                            international organizations and conferences, and a substantially larger
                            proportion of my own time is being devoted to the preparation and
                            presentation of our position in these forums. Yet the mood and conduct
                            of many in the United Nations and other international gatherings have
                            become increasingly hostile to us.</p>
                        <p>In the Department and at our posts overseas there must be a greater
                            appreciation of the importance of our stake in multilateral diplomacy
                            and correspondingly greater attention to the actions and attitudes of
                            other countries in international forums. On matters of significant
                            concern to the United States all regional bureaus must clearly
                            understand our interests in issues that arise in the various
                            international forums and must endeavor to gain the maximum possible
                            support from countries in their area on these issues.</p>
                        <p>There are many countries where our bilateral relations are of less
                            significance than our relations with those countries within the
                            multilateral context. We must therefore make a more systematic effort to
                            ensure that our bilateral and multilateral interests are mutually
                            supportive.</p>
                        <p>In some cases a simple lobbying effort or a more skillful use of
                            available bilateral tools, however small, may suffice to move another
                            government in our direction. In other cases it may become necessary for
                            us to react against those who persistently and vigorously oppose us.</p>
                        <p>As part of this effort I am directing <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss>
                            to provide regional bureaus and embassies with complete and timely
                            information on significant issues coming up in international
                            organizations and conferences as well as on our policy views regarding
                            these matters. I am also directing IO to exploit more fully our computer
                            capability in order to develop a better statistical base and to make it
                            possible for us to analyze the positions taken by other countries in
                            international meetings.</p>
                        <p>Telegrams reporting developments in United Nations and related
                            international meetings will be assigned for action to IO, and it will be
                            the responsibility of that Bureau to prepare instructions for a proper
                            follow-up. These instructions will, of course, be cleared with the

                        <p>Organizing for Multilateral Diplomacy</p>
                        <p>Reaction to Moynihan's Proposals</p>
                        <p>At my recent meeting with regional assistant Secretaries on Pat
                            Moynihan's proposals regarding multilateral diplomacy, I found strong
                            agreement on the fundamental point of giving greater weight to foreign
                            government actions on multilateral issues of importance to the United
                            States. But there was deep skepticism regarding some of the suggested
                            tactics, such as a list of "multilateral countries." It is believed that
                            we should concentrate our efforts not on weak, "multilateral countries"
                            but should engage in a year-round effort throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>The assistant Secretaries also believe that the scope for threats or
                            blandishments is limited and either will depend on your own support for
                            any real impact. In their view we must organize ourselves better in this
                            area; we must bring our influence to bear early; and we will need the
                            consistent support of you and the President if other countries are to be
                            convinced that we are serious about multilateral issues.</p>
                        <p>In short, the bureaus are prepared to cooperate but will need a lead from
                            the Seventh Floor to introduce institutional changes. (Individual bureau
                            views are contained in memoranda attached at Tab 1.)</p>
                        <p>What Has Been Done</p>
                        <p>As an initial step we have established in <gloss target="#t_IO1"
                                >IO</gloss> an Office of Multilateral Affairs, headed by a deputy
                            assistant secretary with a staff of four. (I have talked to Bev Carter
                            about the job. He is interested, but wants to think about it and will be
                            back to me early in the week.) This office will</p>
                        <p>--provide bureaus and embassies with full and timely background
                            information and instructions on all matters of importance arising in
                            international forums,</p>
                        <p>--work closely and continuously with bureaus to insure that multilateral
                            considerations are taken into account in all bilateral diplomatic
                            activities,</p>
                        <p>-- use computer data for the preparation of guidance and instructions to
                            posts.</p>
                        <p>We have already begun to employ the Department's computer capability to
                            establish basic data regarding voting in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. IO plans to use this data in analyzing voting trends
                            and in other ways that may promote our multilateral diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>Personnel is now developing a new code system which will make possible
                            the identification of various skills related to multilateral diplomacy.
                            This system will assist the Department in making assignments to key
                            Multilateral affairs positions and in developing a skilled corps of
                            multilateral officers.</p>
                        <p>What We Plan To Do</p>
                        <p>The essence of the job will be persistent and skillful lobbying carried
                            out throughout the year by the Department, <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> and embassies. A much fuller flow of background
                            information and guidance to the posts will be vital. While the burden of
                            operational responsibility will fall on IO, certain further steps should
                            be taken to create better means of insuring that multilateral affairs
                            receive significantly greater attention than in the past. Among the
                            immediate steps that I recommend are:</p>
                        <p>--a letter from you to each ambassador informing him of what we are doing
                            and instructing to give personal attention to multilateral affairs.
                            (Draft letter attached at Tab 2.)</p>
                        <p>Approve <lb/>Disapprove</p>
                        <p>Letter should be from:</p>
                        <p>--encouraging each bureau in cooperation with IO to designate a position
                            in certain embassies for multilateral affairs.</p>
                        <p>Approve<lb/>Disapprove</p>
                        <p>-- direct each assistant secretary to designate one of his deputies to be
                            responsible for multilateral affairs and to serve as a contact point for
                            IO's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. Suggest that
                            bureaus consider appointing an officer to maintain working level liaison
                            between desks and IO regarding these ratters.</p>
                        <p>Approve<lb/>Disapprove</p>
                        <p>--authorize bureaus in cooperation with IO to send a high-level expert
                            once a year from Washington to key overseas posts to discuss
                            multilateral affairs.</p>
                        <p>Approve<lb/>Disapprove</p>
                        <p>Long-Term Goals</p>
                        <p>There are a number of other steps now under consideration which could
                            strengthen our ability to conduct more effective multilateral diplomacy.
                            These are long-term aims intended to develop a group of officers with
                            expertise in the field and to assign them in accordance with a
                            systematic policy. (A memorandum on this subject prepared by IO is
                            attached at Tab 3.) These proposals include:</p>
                        <p>--special incentives to attract outstanding officers to the multilateral
                            specialty.</p>
                        <p>--special and separate handling of assignment for multilateral officers
                            similar to that for other major bureaus.</p>
                        <p>--firm personnel policy regarding senior assignment for multilateral
                            officers.</p>
                        <p>--training programs for multilateral affairs specialists.</p>
                        <p>The steps we have already taken along with those proposed here for your
                            approval will give us the institutionalization necessary to move ahead
                            in this area. Effective results will depend on the Department's
                            constancy of determination in the months ahead. Plain hard work twelve
                            months a year around the world will be necessary if we are to have the
                            necessary impact.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: Organizing for Multilateral Diplomacy</p>
                        <p>Following our meeting in October on how to our diplomatic activity in the
                            United Nations and related organizations, I sent a memorandum to the
                            Secretary informing him both of what we have already done and of your
                            suggestions on further measures. The Secretary has approved these
                            additional proposals and has asked us to proceed to implement them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary himself will send a telegram to all ambassadors informing
                            them of the Department’s increased interest in multilateral diplomacy,
                            describing the steps we are taking in response to this and suggesting
                            what each embassy might do in this regard.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the Secretary would like you to take a number of
                            immediate steps on your own. He requests you to designate one of your
                            deputies to take responsibility for multilateral affairs for your bureau
                            and to serve as a primary contact point for Assistant Secretary

                            the near future <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> will establish an
                            Office of Multilateral Affairs headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary.)
                            The Secretary leaves it up to you to decide whether you wish in addition
                            to appoint one of your officers to maintain working level liaison
                            between the desks and IO regarding these matters. The Secretary would
                            also like you to work with IO to determine which of your embassies
                            should designate a position for multilateral affairs. Finally, he wants
                            you to maintain closer contact with your posts on multilateral affairs
                            and in this connection authorizes you to send a bureau principal,
                            presumably the deputy you designate for multilateral work, to brief your
                            key posts once a year on multilateral affairs.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this the Secretary will rely on each bureau to decide how it can
                            best further our interests in the multilateral sphere. I hope you will
                            give this issue your continued personal attention and will work with IO
                            to instruct your posts on the specific ways they can implement the
                            Secretary's desire for a greater effort in multilateral affairs. I
                            attach for your information a copy of a telegram which <gloss
                                target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> has sent its embassies.</p>
                        <p>I will be in touch with the functional bureaus to inform them of these
                            steps and to ask for their cooperation.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: ORGANIZING FOR MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY</p>
                        <p>FOR AMBASSADOR FROM THE SECRETARY</p>
                        <p>1. WITH THE INCREASING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND RELATED
                            ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY, I ASKED THE REGIONAL ASSISTANT
                            SECRETARIES SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TO CONSIDER WAYS TO PROMOTE OUR POLICY
                            INTERESTS MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MULTILATERAL FORUMS. THERE WAS A
                            CONSENSUS THAT WE MUST GIVE GREATER ATTENTION TO MULTILATERAL RELATIONS
                            AND DO MORE TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITIONS. THIS TELEGRAM IS TO
                            INFORM YOU OF THE INCREASED IMPORTANCE THAT WE INTEND TO ATTACH TO OTHER
                            COUNTRIES' ACTIONS ON MULTILATERAL ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNITED
                            STATES AND OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL INITIATIVES WE HAVE TAKEN IN THE
                            DEPARTMENT TO INTENSIFY OUR MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY.</p>
                        <p>2. ONE OF THE FACTORS BY WHICH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WILL MEASURE THE
                            VALUE ANOTHER COUNTRY ATTACHES TO ITS RELATIONSHIP TO US WILL BE ITS
                            STATEMENTS AND ITS VOTES ON MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO US IN INTERNATIONAL
                            FORUMS. UNFRIENDLY ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS--INDISCRIMINATE OPPOSITION TO
                            RESOLUTIONS OF SIGNIFICANCE TO US OR SPEECHES BROADLY ATTACKING THE
                            UNITED STATES--MAY WELL HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR BILATERAL
                            RELATIONSHIP. THE FACT THAT SMALL STATES HAVE AN EQUAL VOICE WITH THE
                            GREAT POWERS IN MOST INTERNATIONAL FORUMS REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD
                            BEHAVE WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND AN AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT THEIR POSITION
                            CAN HAVE IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH US.</p>
                        <p>3. FOR THESE REASONS I AM REQUESTING YOU AND ALL OTHER AMBASSADORS, AS I
                            HAVE ALREADY REQUESTED THE REGIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARIES, TO TAKE
                            GREATER PERSONAL INTEREST IN MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY. TO PROVIDE
                            ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT FOR YOUR EFFORTS, I HAVE DIRECTED <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSW1">SAM LEWIS</persName> TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF
                            MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS WITH A DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY AND A SMALL
                            SUPPORTING STAFF. THIS OFFICE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THE
                            OTHER BUREAUS TO PROVIDE OVERSEAS POSTS WITH THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND
                            INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS. IT WILL ALSO DRAW ON THE DEPARTMENT'S
                            COMPUTER CAPABILITY TO COMPILE AND ANALYZE DATA ON VOTING TRENDS IN
                            INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. PERSONNEL IS NOW DEVELOPING A NEW CODE
                            SYSTEM WHICH WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE IDENTIFICATION OF VARIOUS SKILLS
                            RELATED TO MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY. THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP THE DEPARTMENT
                            IN MAKING ASSIGNMENTS TO KEY MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS POSITIONS AND IN
                            DEVELOPING A SKILLED CORPS OF MULTILATERAL OFFICERS. I HAVE ALSO ASKED
                            EACH ASSISTANT SECRETARY TO DESIGNATE ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES AND POSSIBLY A
                            MEMBER OF THE BUREAU STAFF TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MULTILATERAL
                            DIPLOMACY IN THAT BUREAU.</p>
                        <p>4. IN THESE WAYS I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU
                            WITH THE FLOW OF TIMELY GUIDANCE THAT YOU WILL NEED TO SUPPORT OUR
                            POSITION WITH YOUR HOST GOVERNMENT. SUCCESS WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE
                            EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR MISSION'S WORK WITH ITS HOST GOVERNMENT. TO
                            PARALLEL OUR OWN ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATIONS, YOU MAY WISH TO DESIGNATE
                            ONE OF YOUR SENIOR OFFICIALS TO TAKE DAY-TO-DAY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE
                            MATTERS AND IN SOME EMBASSIES WE MAY LATER ON DESIGNATE ONE POSITION FOR
                            MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS. WHATEVER INSTITUTIONAL STEPS YOU TAKE, I HOPE YOU
                            WILL GIVE THESE MATTERS PERSONAL ATTENTION.</p>
                        <p>5. WORKING TOGETHER, THE DEPARTMENT AND THE OVERSEAS POSTS WILL, I
                            BELIEVE, BE ABLE TO DEVELOP GREATER SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITION IN
                            INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND IN THIS WAY STRENGTHEN THESE
                            ORGANIZATIONS WHILE FURTHERING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. <persName

                        <p>SUMMARY: UNLIKE LAST DECEMBER, WHEN THE AFRICAN GROUP AS A WHOLE LEFT THE
                            29TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN A STATE OF EUPHORIA, MOST AFRICANS RETURNING
                            HOME THIS YEAR DO SO FRUSTRATED. FOR THEY CARRY ONLY THAT FOR WHICH THEY
                            IN CONCERT WITH OTHER GROUPS WERE RESPONSIBLE: MANY EXTREME,
                            UNENFORCEABLE AND OFTEN CONFLICTING RESOLUTIONS; AN ALUM OF ACRIMONY;
                            AND A RECORD OF UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC EXPRESSIONS OF DIFFERENCE. END
                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. WITH THE ADDITION OF FOUR MORE AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS
                            THIS YEAR, AFRICAN STATES (EXCLUDING SOUTH AFRICA) NOW NUMBER FORTY-SIX,
                            OR ALMOST A THIRD OF THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> MEMBERSHIP.
                            WHEREAS THE WATCHWORD OF THE AFRICAN GROUP PRIOR TO THIS GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN, LITERALLY, THAT "PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF DISAGREEMENT
                            AMONG AFRICAN MEMBERS ARE A SIGN OF POLITICAL IMMATURITY", THIS
                            GUIDELINE WAS REVERSED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE 30TH UNGA. DISAGREEMENT
                            NOW IS LAUDED AS A SIGN OF POLITICAL MATURITY. WHAT EFFECTED THIS
                            CHANGE? FIVE KEY FACTORS WERE INVOLVED: </p>
                        <p>A. AN ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP: THE LEADERSHIP EXERCISED BY
                            ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER <persName corresp="#p_BAA1"
                                >BOUTEFLIKA</persName> AT THE 29TH UNGA WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
                            THE "SUCCESS" OF THE AFRICAN GROUP LAST YEAR. BOUTEFLIKA, FOR REASONS
                            PRESUMABLY BEST EXPLAINED BY INTERNAL ALGERIAN POLITICAL DYNAMICS, DID
                            NOT PERFORM THAT VITAL FUNCTION THIS YEAR. BOUTEFLIKA'S COMPARATIVE
                            INACTION DOES NOT EXPLAIN ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, WHY ALGERIA, WHICH WANTED
                            SO TO CONTINUE IN ITS LEADERSHIP POSITION, LOST ITS SPELL OVER THE
                            AFRICANS (AND OTHERS) IN VIRTUALLY ALL <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            COMMITTEES. PERHAPS THE MISTAKE CAN BE TRACED TO EARLY THIS YEAR, WHEN
                            ALGERIAN PERM REP <persName corresp="#p_RA3">RAHAL</persName> STATED
                            THAT THE 30TH UNGA BEGAN JANUARY 1, 1975. HE WAS REFERRING TO THE MYRIAD
                            OF CONFERENCES LEADING UP TO THE SESSION -- CONFERENCES WHICH, IN 1974,
                            UNDER ALGERIAN LEADERSHIP, HAMMERED OUT MOST OF THE POSITIONS WHICH WERE
                            HEEDED BY THE "NON-ALIGNED" DURING THE 29TH GA. BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED
                            ON THE WAY TO NEW YORK. THE ALGERIANS DISCOVERED AT REGIONAL CONFERENCES
                            THAT ALGERIAN MINISTERS OTHER THAN BOUTEFLIKA LACKED THE FOREIGN
                            MINISTER'S CHARM AND ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. HIS REPLACEMENTS RESORTED
                            INSTEAD TO STRONG-ARM TACTICS, WHICH ANTAGONIZED MORE THAN ANYTHING
                            ELSE. NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BOUTEFLIKA EMERGED FROM ELSEWHERE DURING THE
                            30TH UNGA, INCLUDING THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> OBSERVER'S
                            OFFICE, AND THAT AFRICAN LEADERSHIP WHICH THERE WAS WAS EXERCISED BY
                            INEFFICIENT DEMAGOGUES WHO WERE THE GROUP'S MONTHLY CHAIRMEN --
                            REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LIKES OF BENIN AND EQUATORIAL GUINEA. THE
                            INABILITY OF THE ALGERIANS TO INFLUENCE CRITICAL DECISIONS RELATING TO
                            THE SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION AND SPANISH SAHARA MAY HAVE AFFECTED AS WELL
                            THEIR "LONG-RANGE" LEADERSHIP ROLE AT THE UNITED NATIONS. IN THE VIEW OF
                            MANY, IT WAS THE ALGERIANS WHO LOST THE MOST DURING THE 30TH UNGA. THE
                            TITULAR HEAD OF THE "NON-ALIGNED" NOW BECOMES SRI LANKA. BUT, WITH
                            LITTLE IDEOLOGICAL STRENGTH, OR DEPTH IN MANPOWER, AND DESPITE SRI
                            LANKA'S PROBABLE PRESIDENCY OF THE 31ST UNGA, SEVERAL, INCLUDING THIS
                            MISSION, VIEW THE HEIR APPARENT TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE "NON-ALIGNED"
                            (INCLUDING THE AFRICANS HERE) TO BE THE VIETNAMESE. THE FRENCH
                            AMBASSADOR SHARES THIS VIEW. NEXT YEAR? PERHAPS NOT, BUT CERTAINLY A
                            DEVELOPMENT WORTH WATCHING.</p>
                        <p>B. ARAB PARSIMONY: THE AFRICANS HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD
                            RECEIVE FAR MORE AID THAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FROM THE ARABS, IN RETURN
                            FOR BREAKING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL AND VOTING SYMPATHETICALLY ON ARAB
                            CAUSES. IN FACT, THE ARABS HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE AT ALL IN THE AREA OF
                            AID TO AFRICA, AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN LOST ON THE AFRICANS. SUCH IS
                            IRONIC INDEED, SINCE MOST BLACK AFRICANS CONCEDE TO US PRIVATELY THAT
                            "BLOC VOTING" WOULD RESUME WERE THE ARABS TO BECOME MORE GENEROUS.</p>
                        <p>C. NEW ASPECTS OF THE DECOLONIZATION PROCESS: SOLUTIONS TO "COLONIAL
                            QUESTIONS" ARE NO LONGER SIMPLE FOR THE AFRICANS. PREVIOUSLY, THESE WERE
                            ISSUES WHICH OCCASIONED VIRTUALLY AUTOMATIC AFRICAN UNANIMITY. THE UN'S
                            CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR OF SPANISH SAHARA, FRENCH SOMALILAND, BELIZE,
                            TIMOR, AND ANGOLA SHOWED UNPRECEDENTED FACTIONALISM AND OPEN
                            DISAGREEMENT. ON THE SAHARA, FOR INSTANCE, IN PLENARY VOTING, THE
                            MOROCCAN-INSPIRED RESOLUTION WAS APPROVED, 56(US)-42-34. THIRTEEN
                            AFRICAN STATES VOTED "YES", 22 VOTED "NO", 7 ABSTAINED. ON THE
                            PRO-ALGERIAN RESOLUTION, WHICH PASSED, 88-0-41(US), 30 AFRICAN STATES
                            VOTED FOR, 11 ABSTAINED. EVEN ON RHODESIA AND NAMIBIA, THERE WERE PUBLIC
                            EXPRESSIONS OF DIFFERENCES AMONG THE AFRICANS CONCERNING MODALITIES FOR
                            SOLUTIONS.</p>
                        <p>D. MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE: ON THE ZIONISM ISSUE AND ON ANGOLA, THE MAJORITY
                            OF SUB-SAHARAN NON-ISLAMIC, NON-RADICAL AFRICAN STATES WERE NOT TO BE
                            PUSHED AROUND BY THE ARABS AND THE COMMUNISTS. THEY ARGUED THEIR
                            PRINCIPLES, AND GAVE SUPPORT TO POSITIONS SHARED BY THE UNITED STATES.
                            ON ZIONISM, THIS WAS THE SAME COALITION WHICH HAD DEVELOPED IN KAMPALA
                            AND LIMA. IT INVOLVED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AN ARTICULATE AND FORCEFUL
                            ROLE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF ZAIRE. IN PLENARY VOTING ON THE ZIONISM
                            EQUALS RACISM RESOLUTION, AMONG SUB-SAHARAN BLACK AFRICAN STATES WITHOUT
                            A SIGNIFICANT ISLAMIC POPULATION AND NOT UNDER A POLITICALLY "RADICAL"
                            INFLUENCE, 26 EITHER OPPOSED EQUATING ZIONISM WITH RACISM OR ABSTAINED,
                            WHILE ONLY 2 IN THAT CATEGORY DID LINK IT. ON A PREVIOUS MOTION, 12 IN
                            THAT SAME CATEGORY HAD VOTED TO DEFER THE QUESTION UNTIL NEXT YEAR; ONLY
                            2 OPPOSED DEFERRAL, AND 3 ABSTAINED.</p>
                        <p>E. SPECIAL SESSION: THE SUCCESS OF THE SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION ALSO
                            ENCOURAGED SPLITS WITHIN THE AFRICAN GROUP AT THE 30TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                            IT IS A SIMPLE FACT THAT MANY FOURTH WORLD COUNTRIES, ON THE BRINK OF
                            STARVATION, CHOSE FOOD FROM AND COOPERATION WITH THE WEST RATHER THAN
                            THE STERILE RHETORIC OF THEIR THIRD WORLD BROTHERS. THUS, THE MOOD
                            GENERATED PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE 30TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS A
                            SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN SHAPING VOTING THEREAFTER.</p>
                        <p>2. AFTER CATALOGUING THESE ELEMENTS OF DISUNITY, THE RECORD MUST BE MADE
                            COMPLETE BY FLAGGING THE FACT THAT ALL THE EX-PORTUGUESE AFRICAN
                            TERRITORIES NOW IN THE UNITED NATIONS ARE BEHAVING AND VOTING ALMOST
                            EXCLUSIVELY WITH THE SOVIETS. ALSO ADD BENIN, THE COMOROS, AND SEVERAL
                            OTHERS TO THAT GROUP, WHOSE RELIABILITY IN SUPPORTING MOSCOW PARALLELS
                            POLAND'S. CONSIDER GENERAL AFRICAN SUPPORT ON KOREA: TAKING FIRST THE
                            NINE SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES WITH A SIGNIFICANT ISLAMIC POPULATION, THE
                            VOTING PATTERNS IN PLENARY ON THE US-COSPONSORED RESOLUTION AND THE
                            COMMUNIST-SPONSORED RESOLUTION WERE 0(US)-5-4 FOR THE US-COSPONSORED
                            RESOLUTION, 7-0(US)-2 FOR THE COMMUNIST-SPONSORED RESOLUTION. TAKING
                            NEXT THE THIRTY-TWO SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ISLAMIC
                            POPULATIONS, THE VOTING PATTERNS IN PLENARY ON KOREA WERE AS FOLLOWS:
                            US-COSPONSORED RESOLUTION 8(US)-19-5, COMMUNIST-SPONSORED RESOLUTION
                            20-7(US)-5. (ABSENCES ARE COUNTED FOR THIS PURPOSE AS ABSTENTIONS; SOUTH
                            AFRICA IS EXCLUDED FROM THESE STATISTICS.</p>
                        <p>3. HOW HAS THE UNITED STATES BEEN PERCEIVED BY THE AFRICANS DURING THE
                            30TH SESSION? AS IN ALL QUESTIONS HERE, THERE IS A PUBLIC AND A PRIVATE
                            RESPONSE. PUBLICLY, AFRICANS SEEM TO FEEL ABOUT US AS DID THE FRENCH AT
                            THE HEIGHT OF PARIS' TOURIST BOOM IN THE 1950'S. AMERICANS ARE NOISY AND
                            PUSHY, AND WE'D JUST AS SOON DO WITHOUT YOU. PRIVATELY, AFRICANS TALK OF
                            US AS DID THE FRENCH HOTEL OWNERS OF THE 1970'S: WE DON'T LIKE YOU THAT
                            MUCH, BUT YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER WHICH WE NEED DESPERATELY, AND
                            NO ONE ELSE REALLY CARES ABOUT US AS MUCH. AND IN ALL THE CORRIDOR AND
                            PUBLIC DEBATE GOING ON OVER ANGOLA, THERE HAS BEEN FEAR OF SOVIET
                            RECOLONIZATION AND OF SOUTH AFRICAN RECOLONIZATION, BUT NOT OF AMERICAN
                            COLONIZATION OF AFRICA. FURTHER, THE EXAMPLE OF THE UNITED STATES
                            SPEAKING OUT AT THE 30TH UNGA MAY WELL HAVE ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO DO SO,
                            AND COULD DO SO EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE. VERY FEW WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THIS,
                            SINCE IT IS NOT A PARTICULARLY POPULAR REACTION TO CONCEDE.</p>
                        <p>4. SO, MANY AFRICANS RETURN HOME LICKING THEIR WOUNDS FROM OPEN SPLITS ON
                            KEY ISSUES AT THE 30TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED OVER WHAT
                            MANY, INCLUDING LEADERS SUCH AS SALIM OF TANZANIA, FEEL TO BE AN
                            ABANDONMENT OF IDEALS (SAHARA, TIMOR). "BROTHERS" TURNED OUT NOT TO BE
                            BROTHERS AFTER ALL. (HOW MANY REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE IN THE FIRST
                            PLACE?) WHILE THE RADICALISM REMAINS, AND AFRICANS ACCOUNTED FOR FULLY A
                            THIRD OF THE ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC AT THE 30TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY, WE
                            NEVERTHELESS CONCLUDE OPTIMISTICALLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR OWN
                            NATIONAL INTERESTS. THE AFRICANS HERE ARE BEHAVING MORE AND MORE
                            INDIVIDUALISTICALLY. SUCH REALISM IS INDEED IN OUR OWN INTERESTS. BESET
                            WITH MOUNTING AND COMPLICATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS, THE
                            AFRICANS MAY BE SENSING TO A GREATER DEGREE THE NEED FOR PRACTICAL
                            RATHER THAN PURELY DEMONSTRATIVE RESULTS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. IF
                            THIS IS SO, AGAIN, IT IS IN OUR INTERESTS. <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"

                        <p>DURING THE 30TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY (UNGA),
                            THE 22-MEMBER "WESTERN EUROPEAN AND OTHERS" GROUP (<gloss
                                target="#t_WEO1"> WEOG</gloss>) WAS MARKED IN PARTICULAR BY
                            INCREASING COHESION WITHIN ITS KEY <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss>
                            COMPONENT. THERE WERE, HOWEVER, SERIOUS INSTANCES OF LACK OF EC-9 AND
                            NATO SOLIDARITY ON KEY ISSUES AND SUPPORT FOR U.S. AND NATO INTERESTS
                            WAS NOTABLY DEFICIENT.</p>
                        <p>USUN ATTENDED WEOG AMBASSADORIAL- LEVEL MEETINGS AS AN OBSERVER AND WEOG
                            LOWER-LEVEL MEETINGS AS A PARTICIPANT. ADDITIONALLY, USUN PARTICIPATED
                            AT AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL IN VINCI GROUP MEETINGS (WEOG PLUS U.S. AND
                            JAPAN). ACTIVE U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE WEOG CONTINUES TO BE WELCOME BY
                            THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WEOG MEMBERS. WITHIN THE WEOG, THERE HAS BEEN A
                            FIRMING OF POSITION AGAINST LEFTIST TACKS BY WEOG MEMBERS SUCH AS SWEDEN
                            OR MALTA. GIVEN THE ROLE AT THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> OF THE
                            WEOG AS A PRINCIPAL FONT OF SUPPORT FOR WESTERN DEMOCRATIC POSITIONS, IT
                            BEHOOVES US TO MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP PARTICULARLY CLOSE TIES AND
                            COORDINATION WITH THIS GROUP. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. COMPOSITION OF THE WEOG:</p>
                        <p>THE WEOG IN THE UN CONTEXT COMPRISES ALL THE NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES OF
                            WESTERN EUROPE (INCLUDING MALTA, BUT NOT CYPRUS) PLUS AUSTRALIA, CANADA,
                            AND NEW ZEALAND (22 COUNTRIES IN ALL). AT AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL WEOG
                            MEETINGS, THE U.S. PARTICIPATES AS AN OBSERVER AS DO SWITZERLAND AND THE

                            MEETINGS), THE U.S. PARTICIPATES AS A FULL MEMBER. ADDITIONALLY, USUN AT
                            AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL PARTICIPATES IN VINCI GROUP (<gloss
                                target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>) MEETINGS (WEOG PLUS U.S. AND
                            JAPAN). THE EC-9 ACTS AS A CORE WITHIN THE WEOG ON MOST IMPORTANT
                            ISSUES. OTHER WEOG MEMBERS ARE INFLUENCED BY EC-9 POSITIONS (AS IS THE
                            WEOG BY U.S. POSITIONS). HOWEVER, THIS INFLUENCE VARIES FROM ZERO IN THE
                            CASE OF MALTA TO MUCH IN THE CASE OF CANADA, WHICH ON MOST ISSUES
                            PARALLELS THE EC-9. THE NORDIC COUNTRIES AND AUSTRIA SOMETIMES LINE UP
                            WITH THE EC-9. AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND HAVE OFTEN SIDED WITH THE
                            NON-ALIGNED, BUT SO HAVE THE STRONGLY SUPPORTED WESTERN POSITIONS.
                            JAPAN, ALTHOUGH NOT A WEOG MEMBER, PARTICIPATES IN THE VINCI GROUP AND
                            OFTEN IDENTIFIES ITSELF WITH <gloss target="#t_WEO1">WEO</gloss> AND
                            EC-9 POSITIONS IN BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREAS. FINALLY SPAIN,
                            PORTUGAL, GREECE, AND TURKEY ARE INDIVIDUAL CASES. AS DISCUSSED IN
                            REFTEL, THERE IS NO PURELY NATO CAUCUS IN NEW YORK. HOWEVER, THE WEOG
                            AND THE VINCI GROUP PROVIDE FOR MEETINGS OF ALL NATO MEMBERS ALBEIR IN
                            THE COMPANY OF OTHERS.</p>
                        <p>3. EC-9 AND NATO PERFORMANCE:</p>
                        <p>(A) EC-9 AND OFTEN FRUSTRATING AND DISAPPOINTING 30TH UNGA, EC-9
                            COHESIVENESS AND GENERAL ALIGNMENT WITH U.S. POSITIONS WAS ENCOURAGING.
                            THE EC-9 ARE PROUD OF THEIR INCREASING COHESIVENESS AND SAY SO IN
                            PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. THEY HAVE POINTED OUT THAT AT THE 27TH UNGA (1972)
                            THEY VOTED IN PLENARY AS A BLOC ON 67 PERCENT OF THE ISSUES WHILE AT THE
                            30TH SESSION THE PERCENTAGE ROSE TO 84 PERCENT. AT THE 30TH UNGA, ITALY
                            AS EC-9 PRESIDENT, DELIVERED COMMON STATEMENTS OF POSITION FOR THE EC-9,
                            INCLUDING SEVEN IN PLENARY. AT THE 30TH UNGA THERE WAS, NEVERTHELESS,
                            DIVERGENCE AMONGST THE EC-9 ON 34, SOMETIMES KEY, RESOLUTIONS. THERE
                            WERE, HOWEVER, FEW CASES WHERE ONE OR MORE OF THE EC-9 VOTED "NO" OR
                            "YES" WHEN THE MAJORITY VOTED THE OTHER WAY. DIVERGENCE WAS MOST OFTEN
                            REFLECTED BY ABSTENTIONS. ON KOREA AND "ZIONISM," THE EC-9 WERE WITH US
                            FOURSQUARE, BUT ON PALESTINE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND GUAM THEY SPLIT.
                            FRANCE, DENMARK, IRELAND AND THE NETHERLANDS MOST OFTEN VOTED
                            DIFFERENTLY THAN THE MAJORITY OF THE EC-9. USUN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE
                            EC-9 ON ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE US, WHILE NORMALLY CONDUCTED IN THE
                            BROADER WEOG CONTEXT, WERE HELPFUL IN OUR LOBBYING EFFORTS. UNDER
                            ITALY'S ENERGETIC EC-9 LEADERSHIP, THERE EMERGED A STRONGER SENSE OF
                            WESTERN DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY THAN IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE THE
                            IMPRESSION THAT, AS THE EC-9 DEVELOP COHESION OF VIEWS, THEY GAIN
                            COURAGE AND INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS TEND TO BE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE MAVERICK
                            POSITIONS IN THE UN.</p>
                        <p>(B) NATO</p>
                        <p> MOST REGRETTABLY ON THE GUAM RESOLUTION ELEVEN NATO MEMBERS (BELGIUM,
                            CANADA, DEMARK, FRANCE, GREECE, ICELAND, ITALY, NETHERLANDS, NORWAY,
                            PORTUGAL AND TURKEY) ABSTAINED RATHER THAN JOIN <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>, LUXEMBOURG, THE <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> AND
                            THE US IN VOTING AGAINST IT. LACK OF NATO SOLIDARITY WAS ALSO STRIKING
                            ON THE BASKET RESOLUTION ON DECOLONIZATION AND ON THE RESOLUTION ON
                            DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON DECOLONIZATION. NATO VOTES ON THE FIRST
                            WERE: IN FAVOR (8) - CANADA, DENMARK, GREECE, ICELAND, ITALY, NORWAY,
                            PORTUGAL AND TURKEY; AGAINST (1) - US; ABSTAIN (6) - BELGIUM, FRANCE,
                            FRG, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS AND THE UK. NATO VOTES ON THE SECOND WERE:
                            IN FAVOR (13) - BELGIUM, CANADA, DENMARK, FRP, GREECE, ICELAND, ITALY,
                            LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PORTUGAL, TURKEY AND THE UK; AGAINST
                            (1) - US; ABSTAIN (1) FRANCE. THE SPECTACLE OF NATO IN DISARRAY ON THESE
                            RESOLUTIONS WAS DEPLORABLE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE BASKET RESOLUTION ON
                            DECOLONIZATION ENDORSED A REPORT FEATURING, FOR INSTANCE, GROSSLY FALSE
                            ALLEGATION OF NATO SUPPORT FOR RHODESIA AND THE RESOLUTION ON
                            DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON DECLONIZATION CALLED FOR ACTION WHICH
                            WOULD RESULT IN BROAD DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH A FABRICATION. MORE
                            POSITIVELY, HOWEVER NATO VOTES ON THE "ZIONISM" RESOLUTION WERE: IN
                            FAVOR (2) - PORTUGAL AND TURKEY; AGAINST (12) - BELGIUM, CANADA,
                            DENMARK, FRG, ICELAND, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, UK, US;
                            ABSTAIN (1) GREECE.</p>
                        <p>4. OTHER ASPECTS OF WEOG PERFORMANCE:</p>
                        <p>THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS REPRESENTED IN THE WEOG COMBINE A WIDE VARIETY
                            OF NATIONAL INTERESTS AND PROBLEMS. THEREFORE, A FEW COMMENTS ON
                            INDIVIDUAL WEO COUNTRIES AND GROUPINGS SEEM APPROPRIATE:</p>
                        <p>A. FRANCE:</p>
                        <p>EVEN MORE THAN LAST YEAR AS THE FRENCH POSITION BECAME MORE HARMONIOUS
                            UNDER <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">GISCARD D'ESTAING</persName>, THE
                            FRENCH LINED UP MORE EASILY WITHIN THE EC-9 COMMUNITY AND SEEMED MUCH
                            MORE COMFORTABLE IN DEALING WITH US POSITIONS. FOR INSTANCE, FRANCE WITH
                            ITS AMENDMENTS, GAVE US STRONG SUPPORT ON KOREA AND WAS CRUCIAL IN
                            MAINTAINING AND DEVELOPING SUPPORT FOR THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION. ALL THE
                            SAME, FOR INSTANCE, ON SOME DISARMAMENT AREAS AND ON THE RACIAL
                            DISCRIMINATION RESOLUTIONS, FRANCE VOTED INDEPENDENTLY OF EC-9 AND U.S.
                            POSITIONS. USUN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE'S MISSION REMAINS
                            EXCELLENT.</p>
                        <p>B. MALTA:</p>
                        <p>ON EVERY UN ISSUE OF INTEREST TO THE U.S., MALTA SIDED WITH THE
                            NON-ALIGNED OR THIRD-WORLD VIEW. MALTA'S CONTINUED THIRD-WORLD POSITION
                            GAVE HEARTBURN TO MANY WEOG AND EC-9 MEMBERS. SOME (E.G. THE FRG AND THE
                            NETHERLANDS) SUGGESTED INFORMALLY WITHIN THE EC-9 THAT THE TIME MAY HAVE
                            COME TO EXPEL MALTA FROM THE WEOG. </p>
                        <p>C. AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND:</p>
                        <p>WITH NEW CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS JUST INSTALLED, THESE TWO ACTIVE WEOG
                            MEMBERS MAY BECOME LESS INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE NONALIGNED AND MAY
                            RETURN MORE TO THE INNER FOLD OF WEO THINKING. NEVERTHELESS, AT THE 30TH
                            UNGA AUSTRALIA GAVE US OUTSTANDING SUPPORT ON PUERTO RICO AND NEW
                            ZEALAND ON KOREA.</p>
                        <p>D. THE NORDIC GROUP:</p>
                        <p>DURING THE 30TH UNGA, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DIVINE NORDIC SOLIDARITY ON
                            MANY ISSUES. FINLAND ABSTAINED ON THE KOREAN RESOLUTION, VOTED AGAINST
                            US ON GUAM AND THE NORDICS SPLIT ON PALESTINE. ON ZIONISM AS A FORM OF
                            RACISM, ALL THE NORDICS VOTED AGAINST THE RESOLUTION. AMONGST THE
                            NORDICS, SWEDEN AND FINLAND TEND TO TAKE THE MORE DIVERGENT VIEWS.
                            SWEDEN'S ACTION IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN PARTING COMPANY WITH WESTERN
                            MEMBERS TO VOTE UNDER A PRESTIGE-ACCRUING FORMULA TO INVITE THE <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL TABLE PROBABLY
                            STRUCK THE NADIR.</p>
                        <p>E. GREECE AND TURKEY:</p>
                        <p>GREECE AND TURKEY ARE PREOCCUPIED BY CYPRUS AND THEIR VOTING POSITIONS ON
                            OTHER ISSUES USUALLY REFLECT THEIR QUESTS FOR SUPPORT ON CYPRUS
                            RESOLUTIONS.</p>
                        <p>5. FUTURE US-WEOG COOPERATION AT UN:</p>
                        <p>(A) WHILE AT WEOG AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL MEETINGS WE PRESERVE OUR UNIQUE
                            SPECIAL STATUS OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE REGIONAL GROUPS AND ATTEND AS
                            OBSERVERS, ACTIVE US. PARTICIPATION IN THE WEOG CONTINUES TO BE WELCOME
                            BY A GREAT MAJORITY OF ITS MEMBERS. DURING THE 30TH UNGA, WE ATTENDED
                            ALL AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL MEETINGS AND WERE CONSULTED INFORMALLY ON ALL
                            ISSUES. IN THE CASE OF SELECTION OF THE WEOG CANDIDATE FOR THE
                            INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ELECTION, WE PARTICIPATED AT
                            AMBASSADORIAL-LEVEL IN A SECRET STRAW-BALLOT TO HELP THE CHAIRMAN
                            DETERMINE THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE FIVE WEO CANDIDATES. HOWEVER, AT
                            ALL COMMITTEE-LEVEL WEOG MEETINGS WE PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY. WE CHAIRED
                            THE SIXTH COMMITTEE (LEGAL) WEOG MEETINGS. WITH GROWING ECJAO
                            COHESIVENESS ON MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH WHICH WE AND THE EC-9 ARE
                            CONCERNED, THERE HAS BEEN A CERTAIN FIRMING OF POSITIONS AGAINST LEFTIST
                            TACKS TAKEN BY COUNTRIES SUCH AS SWEDEN AND MALTA. NOT SURPRISINGLY,
                            AFTER THE DECISIVE SWEDISH VOTE IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN FAVOR OF PLO
                            PARTICIPATION, A NUMBER OF EC-9 PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES INFORMALLY
                            SUGGESTED THAT SWEDEN MIGHT NOT CONTINUE TO DESERVE WEO SUPPORT. MALTA
                            ALREADY HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM WEOG FIFTH AND SIXTH COMMITTEE MEETINGS.
                            CONVERSELY, BOTH THE EC-9 AND THE WEOG AS A WHOLE, SEEM TO FAVOR CLOSER
                            U.S. PARTICIPATION AND THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF OUR POSITIONS AND
                            VIEWS ON AREAS OF MUTUAL IMPORTANCE. WE SHOULD POINT OUT, THOUGH, THAT
                            CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE U.S., THE EC-9 AND THE WEOG WOULD ENTAIL
                            CERTAIN DANGERS. AS THE EC-9 BECOME MORE COHESIVE, THEY TEND TO CONSULT
                            LESS WITH THE WEOG AS A WHOLE. FURTHERMORE, WITH THEIR POLICY OF
                            CONSENSUS, THE EC-9'S LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR CAN SOMETIMES WEAKEN A
                            SITUATION WHERE THE U.S. COULD COMMAND FULLER SUPPORT FROM SOME MEMBERS
                            OF THE EC-9.</p>
                        <p>(B) DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF COUNTRIES SUCH AS MALTA AND CUBA IN THEIR
                            RESPECTIVE GROUPINGS, THE 22-MEMBER WEOG, AND THE 26-MEMBER LATIN
                            AMERICAN GROUP PROVIDE THE PRINCIPAL WEIGHT OF UN SUPPORT FOR WESTERN
                            DEMOCRATIC POSITIONS. IN 1976 THESE TWO GROUPS WILL PROBABLY REPRESENT
                            LESS THAN 1/3 OF THE UN MEMBERSHIP WHICH NOW TOTALS 144 AND WHICH MAY
                            WELL BE AUGMENTED BY NEW MEMBERS SUCH AS ANGOLA, THE AFARS AND ISSAS,
                            AND THE SEYCHELLES. THUS IT BEHOOVES US TO MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP
                            PARTICULARLY CLOSE TIES AND CONSULTATION WITH THE WEOG, MANY OF WHOSE
                            MEMBERS CAN HELP INFLUENCE FAVORABLY SIGNIFICANT THIRD AND FOURTH WORLD
                            ELEMENTS. FURTHERMORE, INCREASED CONSULTATIONS AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL OF
                            NATO COMBINED WITH THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF KEY ISSUES SHOULD IMPROVE
                            THE NATO PERFORMANCES ON UN ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY WILL PROVIDE MORE WEO
                            SUPPORT FOR US INTERESTS. <lb/>

                        <p>SUMMARY: THE POLICY OF RESISTING ATTACKS AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND IN
                            OTHER SUCH FORUMS SEEMS TO BE SUCCEEDING. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE THOSE
                            WHOSE INTEREST IT IS CONFIDENTIAL TO DEPICT THE POLICY AS FAILING. THIS
                            IS A BIT OF A LOSS AT A TIME WHEN THE REPUBLIC COULD DO WITH A LITTLE
                            SUCCESS AND NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT IT. END SUMMARY. </p>
                        <p>1. TWO BITS OF INTELLIGENCE COMING OUT OF AFRICA SUGGEST THE TIME MAY BE
                            AT HAND TO CONSIDER WHETHER WE HAVE NOT MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS THIS
                            YEAR TOWARD A BASIC FOREIGN POLICY GOAL, THAT OF BREAKING UP THE MASSIVE
                            BLOCS OF NATIONS, MOSTLY NEW NATIONS, WHICH FOR SO LONG HAVE BEEN
                            ARRAYED AGAINST US IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS AND IN DIPLOMATIC ENCOUNTERS
                            GENERALLY. OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND IT IS BY NO
                            MEANS FULLY ACCOMPLISHED. AT MOST WE BEGIN TO SEE SOME SIGNS OF SUCCESS.
                            NOT SURPRISINGLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE DEPARTMENT
                            IS RELUCTANT TO RECOGNIZE THESE SIGNS, OR AT LEAST SLOW TO DO SO. THIS
                            BECOMES A PROBLEM IN ITSELF, AND IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BRIEF ESSAY.</p>
                        <p>2. THE TACTIC, INITIATED AT THIS MISSION ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE
                            PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE, HAS BEEN TO RESPOND TO ATTACK BY
                            COUNTERATTACK. A RECENT ARTICLE IN THE LONDON TIMES DESCRIBED US AS
                            HAVING "TAKEN THE WAR TO THE ENEMY". THIS WAS GENEROUS, BUT PERHAPS NOT
                            ACCURATE. SAVE ON A VERY FEW ISSUES, SUCH AS THE PROPOSAL OF A WORLD
                            WIDE AMNESTY FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS, OUR POSITION AT THE UNITED NATIONS
                            HAS BEEN REACTIVE. FROM A DISTANCE IT MAY HAVE APPEARED CONFRONTATIONAL,
                            BUT THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD
                            BECOME THE SETTING OF SUSTAINED, DAILY ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES,
                            SUCH THAT OUR COUNTERATTACKS MADE IT LOOK LIKE ALL HELL WAS BREAKING
                            LOOSE UP HERE. ACTUALLY WE HAD A NORMAL SESSION WHICH LOOKED ABNORMAL
                            ONLY BECAUSE WE HAD GOT INTO THE PRACTICE OF RESPONDING IN WAYS WHICH
                            OTHERWISE WOULD SEEM QUITE NORMAL AND PREDICTABLE. I RECALL A LUNCHEON
                            EARLY IN THE FALL AT WHICH I WAS ASKING THE YUGOSLAV AMBASSADOR TO TRY
                            TO UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERN THAT THE DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE (THE
                            COMMITTEE OF TWENTY-FOUR), OF WHICH HIS COUNTRY IS A MEMBER, HAD SEEMED
                            SO DETERMINED TO LAUNCH AN INSURGENCY IN PUERTO RICO BY GIVING OFFICIAL
                            OBSERVER STATUS TO THE PUERTO RICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT, WHICH STATUS
                            HAD ALREADY BEEN ACCORDED BY THE "NONALIGNED" AT THEIR LIMA MEETING IN
                            AUGUST. IN THE MOST PLACATORY WAY I SUGGESTED THAT HE CERTAINLY WOULD
                            NOT LIKE THE UNITED STATES TO START SUPPORTING SOME CROATIAN LIBERATION
                            MOVEMENT AT THE UNITED NATIONS. WELL HE SURE WOULDN'T. HE TURNED PURPLE
                            AND STARTED RAVING ABOUT FASCISM. IN NO TIME OUR EMBASSY IN BELGRADE WAS
                            BEING ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION "OF THIS OUTRAGEOUS PROVOCATION."
                            FORTUNATELY OUR AMBASSADOR THERE WAS NOT ABOUT TO BE INTIMIDATED, BUT IT
                            IS THE FACT THAT THE YUGOSLAV REACTION WAS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, NORMAL,
                            WHILE OUR WILLINGNESS TO PUT UP WITH VASTLY GREATER PROVOCATIONS HAS
                            BEEN SINGULAR. WHATEVER THE ORIGINAL SOURCES OF THIS POLICY, IT CAME TO
                            BE DEFENDED ON THE GROUNDS THAT TO DO OTHERWISE -- TO RESIST AGGRESSIVE
                            ACTS -- WOULD SEEM UNFRIENDLY AND WOULD LEAD TO EVEN GREATER AGGRESSION.
                            NOW CLEARLY THOSE INVOLVED WOULD OBJECT TO THIS CHARACTERIZATION, AND
                            WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY ONLY OPPOSE NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE RESPONSES. BUT
                            IT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS MISSION THAT ALMOST ANY RESPONSE WILL BE
                            CHARACTERIZED AS NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE. THIS DOES NOT TAKE PLACE AT THE
                            HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT, BUT IS ENDEMIC TO THE SYSTEM. FOR
                            MONTHS THE RUMOR MILLS IN WASHINGTON HAVE GROUND OUT ASSERTIONS OR
                            INSINUATIONS THAT THE US MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN
                            NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE AND IN CONSEQUENCE HAS LOST CRUCIAL VOTES AND HAS
                            AROUSED YET NEW LEVELS OF HOSTILITY FROM VARIOUS BLOCS OF NATIONS,
                            ESPECIALLY THE SO-CALLED "NONALIGNED."</p>
                        <p>3. JUST AS CLEARLY, THE NATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN OBJECTS OF COUNTERATTACK
                            HAVE SOUGHT TO CONFIRM THIS VIEW. THUS IN AUGUST 1975 THE SECRETARY
                            DIRECTED THAT NOTES BE SENT TO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE DECOLONIZATION
                            COMMITTEE TO THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> STATING THAT SUPPORT
                            FOR THE CUBAN RESOLUTION ON PUERTO RICO WOULD BE REGARDED BY US AS AN
                            UNFRIENDLY ACT. OUR PREVIOUS PATTERN OF NON-RESPONSE HAD BECOME SO FIXED
                            THAT SOME NATIONS SENSED THAT WE HAD MADE A COSTLY BLUNDER. COPIES OF
                            OUR NOTE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE, WERE
                            REPRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED AT THE NONALIGNED CONFERENCE AT LIMA AS
                            EVIDENCE OF AMERICAN PERFIDY FOR WHICH COMPENSATION WOULD HAVE TO BE
                            PAID. THE GOVERNMENT OF TANZANIA EVEN SENT COPIES TO AMERICAN
                            CONGRESSMEN, WHO IT WAS ASSUMED WOULD DEMAND THAT OUR GOVERNMENT RETRACT
                            AND MAKE AMENDS. IN EARLY JANUARY, A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICER SENT A
                            LONG MEMORANDUM TO A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER REVEALING THE SHOCKING NEWS
                            THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD BEGUN THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING FAVORS TO
                            NATIONS WHICH VOTED AGAINST US ON IMPORTANT UN ISSUES, AND TRYING FOR A
                            BIT EXTRA TO THOSE WHO SUPPORTED US.</p>
                        <p>4. ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE, THEN, ARE RECENT REPORTS WHICH SUGGEST THAT
                            OUR NEW STANCE IS HAVING MORE OR LESS THE EFFECT THAT WAS HOPED
                            FOR--THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO THINK THAT ANTI-AMERICAN POSTURES
                            AT THE UN AND ELSEWHERE ARE NOT WITHOUT COST AND THAT THE COST HAS TO BE
                            CALCULATED.</p>
                        <p>5. ITEM. IN A REPORT WE ARE SENDING, WE DESCRIBE THE REACTION OF THE UN
                            ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL FOR SPECIAL POLITICAL QUESTIONS ABDULRAHIM
                            FARAH OF SOMALIA, (PROTECT), THE HIGHEST AFRICAN IN THE UN HIERARCHY,
                            WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> SUMMIT AT
                            ADDIS ABABA. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FAILURE OF THE SOVIETS AND OTHERS TO
                            OBTAIN ENDORSEMENT FOR THE <gloss target="#t_MPLA1">MPLA</gloss> IN
                            ANGOLA, FARAH ASCRIBED SOME OF THE SUCCESS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION,
                            AS HE SAW IT, GIVEN BY AFRICANS TO <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            REPORTS THAT US AID WOULD BE DECREASED TO THOSE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA NOT
                            SYMPATHETIC TO US POSITIONS. THE OFFICER WHO MET WITH FARAH DENIED THAT
                            THERE WAS ANY "BLACK LIST", BUT FARAH OBSERVED THAT WHETHER IT EXISTED
                            OR NOT AFRICANS WERE TAKING SERIOUSLY AND THAT IT WAS, IN HIS WORDS "ALL
                            TO THE GOOD."</p>
                        <p>6. ITEM. EMBASSY KHARTOUM REPORTS THAT AT THE AFRO-ARAB SYMPOSIUM ON
                            LIBERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HELD THERE EARLIER THIS MONTH, TANZANIA TOLD
                            THE CONFERENCE THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD SUSPENDED $28 MILLION IN AID
                            BECAUSE OF TANZANIA'S UNHELPFUL VOTING RECORD AT THE LAST GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY. THE TANZANIAN REPRESENTATIVE URGED THE MEETING TO TAKE A STAND
                            SPECIFICALLY CONDEMNING THE US GOVERNMENT FOR SUCH PRESSURE TACTICS. THE
                            CONFERENCE DECLINED TO DO SO.</p>
                        <p>7. ITEM. IN DECEMBER THE UNITED STATES PRESENTED TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
                            A REPORT ON POLITICAL PRISONERS IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT WAS WITHOUT
                            PRECEDENT IN ITS SPECIFICITY AND DETAIL. WE MAY BE SO BOLD AS TO SUGGEST
                            THAT IN MOVING FROM THE LEVEL OF ABSTRACT GENERALITY TO THAT OF MINUTE
                            PARTICULARS IN THE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AT THE UN, WE MAY
                            HAVE INTRODUCED A CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY COMPARABLE TO THE APPEARANCE OF
                            THE "BRANDEIS BRIEF" IN AMERICAN LEGAL PRACTICE. THIS WAS NOT, HOWEVER,
                            THE REACTION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, WHERE THE DELEGATES BARELY
                            LISTENED TO MR. MITCHELL'S STATEMENT. THE TANZANIAN DELEGATION, WHICH
                            SITS NEXT TO OURS, NEVER INTERRUPTED A NOISY CONFERENCE ABOUT SOME
                            WHOLLY UNRELATED MATTER. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE NEVER
                            CEASED WALKING ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER, TALKING TO OTHER DELEGATES,
                            WHILST OURS WAS SPEAKING FROM THE PODIUM. SUCH WAS THE RECEPTION GIVEN
                            BY THE VERY SAME AFRICANS WHO HAD APPEALED TO US FOR YEARS TO MAKE THIS
                            KIND OF STATEMENT. WE WERE NOT AMUSED. WITHIN TEN MINUTES I PROTESTED TO
                            THE TANZANIAN AMBASSADOR (WHO WAS NOT HIMSELF PRESENT.) A MISSION
                            OFFICER PROTESTED TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE. IN THE
                            WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED THIS MISSION DID INDEED VERGE ON THE NEEDLESSLY
                            PROVOCATIVE, AS WE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY TO SUGGEST THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF
                            THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT DAY CAST GENUINE DOUBT ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF
                            THE ANTI-APARTHEID POSITIONS MOST GOVERNMENTS ASSUME. TODAY, HOWEVER, WE
                            LEARN THAT THE APARTHEID COMMITTEE HAS REPRODUCED IN ONE OF ITS
                            PUBLICATIONS A CONDENSED VERSION OF THE MITCHELL BRIEF. THIS IS THE
                            FIRST OCCASION ANY OF US HERE CAN RECALL ANY SUCH FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO
                            THE UNITED STATES BY THAT COMMITTEE.</p>
                        <p>8. THESE ARE MERELY ITEMS. MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IS THE PATTERN OF VOTING
                            AND DECISION MAKING ON MAJOR ISSUES. ANGOLA IS SUCH AN ISSUE. CLEARLY
                            THE PATTERN OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY HAS BEEN COMPLEX IN THIS MATTER, AS IT
                            SHOULD BE, AND THIS MISSION PROBABLY DOES NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT MOST OF
                            THE MEASURES WE TOOK TO BRING ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AT ADDIS
                            ABABA. BUT WE ARE CLEAR THAT WE TOOK THE ISSUE HEAD ON HERE IN NEW YORK.
                            ON DECEMBER 8, A ROUTINE ANTI-SOUTH AFRICA RESOLUTION PASSING THE
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE A CONDEMNATION OF INTERVENTION
                            IN ANGOLA. ZAIRE PROTESTED THAT SOUTH AFRICA WAS NOT THE ONLY FOREIGN
                            POWER INTERVENING THERE. THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWED BY READING TO THE
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY THE MORNING NEW YORK TIMES, RECOUNTING SOVIET AND CUBAN
                            INVOLVEMENT. EUROPEAN ARMIES WERE BACK IN AFRICA, WE SAID, THE
                            RECOLONIZATION OF THE CONTINENT HAD BEGUN. THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER THE
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY CARED SO LITTLE ABOUT THIS, THAT IT WOULD NOT EVEN
                            ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. NOW THIS PROVOKED MANY DELEGATIONS, NO
                            DOUBT, BUT DEBATE ON THE RESOLUTION WAS IMMEDIATELY HALTED, AND TWO DAYS
                            LATER THE AMENDMENT WAS WITHDRAWN.</p>
                        <p>9. THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING ABOUT THIS. THE NON-ALIGNED OR THE GROUP
                            OF SEVENTY-SEVEN, OR WHATEVER, ARE GROUPS MADE UP OF EXTRAORDINARILY
                            DISPARATE NATIONS, WITH GREATLY DISPARATE INTERESTS. THEIR RECENT
                            BLOC-LIKE UNITY WAS ARTIFICIAL AND WAS BOUND TO BREAK UP. MAINTAINING
                            SOLID RANKS WAS SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TOO MANY MEMBERS, AS WITNESS
                            THE COST OF SAYING NOTHING ABOUT THE <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> PRICE INCREASES WHICH HURT THE DEVELOPING NATIONS FAR
                            MORE THAN THE DEVELOPED ONES. JUST SO ANGOLA. IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT
                            SAVE FOR CONGO NOT A SINGLE AFRICAN COUNTRY ANYWHERE NEAR ANGOLA HAS
                            RECOGNIZED THE MPLA REGIME, WITH ITS RUSSIAN ARMS AND CUBAN GURKHAS. AT
                            THE RECENT GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THE NONALIGNED WERE SIMILARLY DIVIDED IN
                            THE VOTING ON THE SAHARA AND ON TIMOR.</p>
                        <p>10. TO REPEAT, THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS HAVING SO
                            MUCH DIFFICULTY RECOGNIZING THAT OUR PRESENT POLICY, WHICH IS DESIGNED
                            TO HELP WHAT COMES NATURALLY, IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME RESULTS. THE
                            DEPARTMENT RESPONSE ON THE ZIONISM VOTE AT THE LAST <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> WAS A CLASSIC INSTANCE OF REFUSING TO
                            ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WAS IN TRUTH A CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS. NOW THE FACTS ARE
                            THESE. IN THE CRUCIAL VOTE TO POSTPONE CONSIDERATION OF THE RESOLUTION,
                            NINETEEN SUB-SAHARAN NATIONS EITHER VOTED WITH US, OR WERE ABSENT OR
                            ABSTAINED. TWENTY-ONE VOTED AGAINST US. ALMOST A PERFECT SPLIT. LEAVING
                            OUT THOSE SUB-SAHARAN NATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL MOSLEM POPULATIONS, THE
                            VOTE BECOMES EIGHTEEN FOR THE US POSITION, AS AGAINST ONLY TWELVE
                            OPPOSED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE UNITED STATES HAD QUITE A SUCCESS WITH
                            THESE AFRICAN NATIONS. YET FROM THE DAY OF THE VOTE WE HAVE FOUND
                            OURSELVES TALKING TO REPORTERS WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD IN THE STATE
                            DEPARTMENT THAT BECAUSE THE US DELEGATION HAD BEEN "NEEDLESSLY
                            PROVOCATIVE" "CRUCIAL AFRICAN VOTES" HAD BEEN LOST. NO ONE IN THE
                            DEPARTMENT HAS EVER HAD THE COURTESY OR COURAGE TO NAME A SINGLE SUCH
                            CRUCIAL VOTE, WHATEVER CRUCIAL MEANS. THE FACT IS WE WERE NEVER ANYWHERE
                            NEAR WINNING ON THE ZIONISM ISSUE. BUT IN ANY EVENT, THE REAL PHENOMENON
                            TO EXPLAIN IS HOW WE CAME TO GET SO MANY VOTES. NOT WHY WE DIDN'T GET
                            MORE. BUT THOSE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO WERE CONVINCED WE WOULD GET NONE,
                            ARE IMPERVIOUS TO THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS NOT SO. THIS MISSION DOES
                            NOT EXPECT SUCH PERSONS TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS. WE DO ASK HOWEVER THAT
                            OUT OF A DECENT RESPECT FOR THEIR PROFESSION THEY STOP BLABBING TO THE
                            PRESS WHAT IS NOT SO.</p>
                        <p>11. MORE GENERALLY, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT APPEARS TO THIS MISSION THAT
                            THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN TO MAKE A GENERAL, INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF OUR
                            NEW POSTURE AT THE UNITED NATIONS. WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE WOULD BE
                            OPEN TO EVIDENCE OF FAILURE, AND ARE AWARE THAT NO ONE SHOULD ACCEPT OUR
                            OWN ASSESSMENT OF SUCCESS WITHOUT SOME INDEPENDENT ENQUIRY. BUT WE DO
                            FEAR THAT THERE NECESSARILY REMAINS IN THE DEPARTMENT A LARGE FACTION
                            WHICH HAS AN INTEREST IN OUR PERFORMANCE BEING JUDGED TO HAVE FAILED.
                            THIS FACTION HAS NOT HESITATED TO PASS THIS ASSESSMENT ON TO THE PRESS
                            AND TO CONGRESS, AND TO PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT OTHERWISE WOULD
                            HAVE NO VIEW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THIS IS BAD FOR THE PRESIDENT'S
                            POLICY WHICH THE SECRETARY STRIVES TO CARRY OUT. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE
                            SO FEW ALLIES, AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE SLIPPING INTO ALMOST IRREVERSIBLE
                            PATTERNS OF APPEASEMENT BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT AMERICAN POWER IS
                            IRREVERSIBLY DECLINING, WE WOULD HOPE THAT SOME BRAVE SPIRITS IN
                            WASHINGTON AND AROUND THE WORLD WOULD EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE, AND THAT IF
                            CONVINCED THAT THINGS HAVE NOT GONE THAT BADLY UP HERE, TAKE SOME
                            FOREIGN DIPLOMAT TO LUNCH AND TELL HIM SO. <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"

                        <p>1. RESPONSES TO REFERENCED CABLES TO POSTS HAVE PRODUCED A NUMBER OF
                            COMMENTS AND USEFUL QUESTIONS WHICH WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THIS CIRCULAR
                            IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF PROCESS OF OUR MORE REGULAR
                            INJECTION OF MULTILATERAL ISSUES INTO THE CONDUCT OF DECISION-MAKING
                            RELATING TO BILATERAL RELATIONS. THESE ARE DEALT WITH IN Q AND A FORM IN
                            THE PARAGRAPHS BELOW. THEY ARE INTENDED FOR THE INFORMATION OF POSTS
                            ONLY, NOT RPT NOT AS TALKING POINTS.</p>
                        <p>2. ARE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> VOTES ALL THAT IMPORTANT?
                            MOST OF THEM ARE NOT. THE VOTES WE CONSIDER IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO IMPACT
                            ON OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR RANGE BETWEEN 10 AND 20
                            COMMITTEE AND PLENARY BALLOTINGS. THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN TWO
                            CATEGORIES:</p>
                        <p>A. VOTES WHICH AFFECT THE STATUS, LEGITIMACY OR DIPLOMATIC STANDING OF A
                            GIVEN COUNTRY, ENTITY, DEPENDENT TERRITORY OR MOVEMENT IN A NEGATIVE OR
                            POSITIVE WAY, E.G., GUAM, ISRAEL, KOREA, PUERTO RICO, <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> AND PERHAPS NOW THE PANAMA CANAL
                            ZONE.</p>
                        <p>B. ISSUES INVOLVING PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL CONDUCT WHICH WE OR
                            OTHERS ARE TRYING TO LEGITIMIZE: PERMANENT SOVEREIGNTY OVER NATURAL
                            RESOURCES, CONFISCATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION (<gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss> ISSUES); NARROW TRAVERSABLE OR TERRITORIAL SEAS,
                            CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM, TORTURE, (US ISSUES); EVACUATION OF ILLEGALLY
                            OCCUPIED TERRITORY (ARABS VS. ISRAEL, AFRICANS VS. SOUTH AFRICA).</p>
                        <p>3. WHEN SHOULD THESE ISSUES BE DISCUSSED? THEY SHOULD BE DISCUSSED
                            REGULARLY IN THE COURSE OF EMBASSY CONTACTS WITH SENIOR GOVERNMENT
                            OFFICIALS AND BY APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU OFFICERS WITH FOREIGN
                            AMBASSADORS IN WASHINGTON. THIS CAN OFTEN BE DONE BY INTRODUCING THE
                            SUBJECT THROUGH DISCUSSION OF THE KEY <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            CONCERNS OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT AND ILLUSTRATING US RESPONSES TO THESE
                            CONCERNS AND US EXPECTATION OF CONSIDERATION OF ITS CONCERNS. FOR
                            EXAMPLE, IF A HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL MENTIONS THE IMPORTANCE TO IT OF
                            THE LOCAL <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss> PROGRAM, WE MIGHT NOTE
                            THE MAJOR SUPPORT THE US HAS GIVEN THE UNDP OVER THE YEARS IN RESPONSE
                            TO THE CONCERNS OF THE HOST AND SIMILAR GOVERNMENTS, AND EXPRESS THE
                            HOPE THAT OUR OWN CONCERNS IN THE UN WILL RECEIVE A SIMILAR
                            RESPONSIVENESS BY THOSE GOVERNMENTS. </p>
                        <p>4. WHY ARE YEAR-ROUND DISCUSSIONS NECESSARY? THE POSITIONS WHICH
                            REGULARLY GOVERN THE ACTIONS OF UNINSTRUCTED REPRESENTATIVES TO THE UNGA
                            AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES ARE OFTEN SET DOWN IN GROUP
                            DECISIONS OF THE NON-ALIGNED GROUP (92 MEMBERS) AND THE <gloss
                                target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> (107 MEMBERS). THE POTENTIAL FOR
                            OVERWHELMING UN VOTES THAT COMES OUT OF THESE GROUP DECISIONS MAKES IT
                            INCUMBENT UPON US TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE FORMULATION OF THESE DECISIONS
                            THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND WELL IN ADVANCE OF THEIR BEING TAKEN. DIALOGUE
                            WITH THE GOVERNMENTS BELONGING TO THESE GROUPS, EMPHASIZING THE ISSUES
                            OF CONCERN TO US WHICH THESE GROUPS ARE APT TO CONSIDER IS NATURAL
                            BECAUSE THESE ISSUES ARE PART OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS AND SHOULD BE
                            SO HANDLED, AND BECAUSE SO MANY OTHER NATIONS REGARD INTERNATIONAL
                            ORGANIZATIONS AS THE BEST WAY TO PURSUE MANY OF THEIR MOST IMPORTANT
                            FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES.</p>
                        <p>5. DOES THIS INVOLVE USING LEVERAGE AND DO WE HAVE ANY? THE EMPHASIS OF
                            THE EFFORT IS ON PERSUASION. CLEARLY, WE CANNOT ARGUE THAT WE ARE
                            MEETING ALL ARAB CONCERNS ON THE ISRAELI ISSUE, OR ALL AFRICAN CONCERNS
                            ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN ISSUES, BUT WE ARE MEETING SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF
                            THESE COUNTRIES ON THESE ISSUES, AND MANY OF THEIR CONCERNS ON OTHER
                            ISSUES, PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT MATTERS. IT
                            IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WE FEEL ENTITLED TO ASK FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION
                            OF OUR KEY CONCERNS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THESE ISSUES ARE OF SECONDARY
                            IMPORTANCE TO THEM. THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING ON AN
                            ANNUAL BASIS THE DEGREE OF THEIR RESPONSIVENESS ON THESE SELECTED ISSUES
                            SHOULD PROVIDE CLEAR INDICATION THAT THIS RESPONSIVENESS WILL BE TAKEN
                            INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DECISIONS WE MAKE WITH RESPECT TO BILATERAL
                            RELATIONS.</p>
                        <p>6. HOW IS BILATERAL AID LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED? IN TERMS OF ONGOING
                            DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS OF HUMANITARIAN RELIEF, WE
                            DO NOT PLAN, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS WISHES US TO PLAN, TO
                            MANIPULATE SUCH PROGRAMS IN RESPONSE TO VOTING PATTERNS. FOR THE MOST
                            PART, OUR REACTIONS TO UNRESPONSIVENESS TO OUR CONCERNS ON UN ISSUES
                            WILL BE EXPRESSED IN OTHER WAYS THAN THROUGH LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT AND
                            HUMANITARIAN AID PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE RELATIVELY RARE
                            INSTANCES WHEN NEW DECISIONS IN SUCH US PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY
                            INFLUENCED BY VOTING PATTERNS, BUT SUCH INSTANCES MAY OCCUR
                            OCCASIONALLY. BY THE SAME TOKEN US AID PROGRAMS IN THIS CATEGORY WILL
                            ONLY RARELY BE AFFECTED BY MULTILATERAL ACTIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THE US
                            AND ALMOST NEVER AS A RESULT OF A SINGLE VOTE.</p>
                        <p>7. DO WE BEAR ALL THE BURDEN OR WILL ALLIED DEVELOPED COUNTRIES JOIN IN
                            THIS APPROACH? ON ISSUES WHICH ARE AS IMPORTANT TO OUR ALLIES AS THEY
                            ARE TO US, WE WILL ENCOURAGE A SIMILAR APPROACH; IN FACT, MANY COUNTRIES
                            ALREADY USE THIS APPROACH. HOWEVER, ON A NUMBER OF KEY QUOTE STATUS END
                            QUOTE ISSUES, WE GIVE GREATER EMPHASIS TO VOTING OUTCOMES THAN SOME OF
                            OUR ALLIES. GUAM, ISRAEL, KOREA, PUERTO RICO, AND PERHAPS SOON PANAMA,
                            ARE EXAMPLES. OUR ALLIES HAVE BEEN HELPFUL ON ONE OR MORE OF THESE
                            ISSUES, BUT WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THEY MAY NOT
                            CONSIDER THAT THEY HAVE AS GREAT A STAKE IN THE OUTCOME AS WE DO.</p>
                        <p>8. DO WE HAVE THE LEVERAGE WHERE IT COUNTS, E.G., WITH THE LEADING
                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES? WITH A NUMBER OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WE HAVE, IN
                            A WORLD IN WHICH RESOURCES ARE GETTING TIGHTER, MUCH MORE AT STAKE THAN
                            UN VOTES, E.G., ALGERIA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA, IRAN, IRAQ, NIGERIA, SAUDI
                            ARABIA, VENEZUELA AND ZAIRE. WITH SEVERAL OTHERS, EGYPT, JORDAN AND
                            SYRIA, FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDERATIONS OF PEACE-MAKING ARE PARAMOUNT.
                            THEREFORE, THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR VOTING PATTERNS IN OUR BILATERAL
                            RELATIONS WITH THEM WILL BE OUTWEIGHED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IN THE CASE
                            OF STATES WHERE WE HAVE LESS AT STAKE. IN THE RARE CASES IN WHICH
                            NEGATIVE VOTING PATTERNS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE NEGATIVE DECISIONS ON
                            ASSISTANCE LEVELS, IT WILL MORE LIKELY BE SMALLER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE
                            AFFECTED. THESE COUNTRIES WILL THUS BE UNDER GREATER PRESSURE TO BE
                            RESPONSIVE TO OUR UN CONCERNS. HOWEVER, WE WILL, IN MANY CASES, NOT BE
                            ASKING THEM TO ABANDON POSITIONS SUPPORTED BY THEIR LARGER NEIGHBORS.
                            RATHER WE WILL BE ASKING THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM A POSITION HOSTILE TO US
                            OR TO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS EQUALLY AS
                            (DIS)ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM AS TO US.</p>
                        <p>9. IS IT OUR OBJECTIVE TO BREAK UP BLOCS BY THIS PROCEDURE? IT IS NOT OUR
                            OBJECTIVE TO BREAK UP ANY REGIONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL GROUPING. WE RECOGNIZE
                            EVERY STATE'S RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE WITH OTHER STATES IN PURSUIT OF COMMON
                            OBJECTIVES, WHETHER REGIONAL OR ECONOMIC. WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN UN
                            FORUMS, HOWEVER, IS THAT THESE GROUPINGS, PARTICULARLY THE NON-ALIGNED
                            GROUP, ARE FREQUENTLY LED INTO ENDORSEMENT OF POSITIONS WHICH ARE
                            ANTAGONISTIC TO US ON ISSUES WHICH ARE NOT OF MAJOR CONCERN TO MANY OF
                            THEIR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. THIS PRODUCES PRESSURES ON COUNTRIES NORMALLY
                            FRIENDLY TO US TO VOTE ANTAGONISTICALLY. WE WANT, THEREFORE, TO GIVE
                            THESE STATES A STRONG MOTIVATION FOR LOOKING AT ISSUES ON THEIR MERITS
                            AS INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES RATHER THAN AS A BLOC. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS WOULD
                            WEAKEN THE PRACTICE OF BLOC VOTING ON SOME ISSUES, BUT WOULD NOT BE
                            DESIGNED TO DESTROY THE BLOC OR GROUP ITSELF. TO BE FRANK, THERE IS A
                            BETTER CHANCE TO DO THIS BY REGULAR CONTACTS WITH MODERATE SMALLER
                            STATES SUCH AS SIERRE LEONE, GABON, ZAMBIA, ECUADOR, MALAYSIA, AND
                            SINGAPORE, THAN WITH SOME OF THE RESOURCE-RICH STATES SUCH AS VENEZUELA,
                            OR ARAB CONFRONTATION STATES SUCH AS SYRIA.</p>
                        <p>10. SINCE MANY NATIONS DECIDE THEIR UN VOTES IN NEW YORK, OR AT LEAST ARE
                            HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THEIR PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AT THE UN, WHY NOT
                            FOCUS OUR MAIN EFFORT ON THE MISSIONS THERE? WE WANT TO CONVINCE AS MANY
                            COUNTRIES AS POSSIBLE OF THOSE WHO LEAVE THEIR DELEGATES LARGELY
                            UNINSTRUCTED THAT THIS IS NOT A PRACTICE WHICH IS IN THEIR INTEREST. IN
                            MANY CASES, CAPITALS ARE UNAWARE OF ACTIVITIES BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
                            AT THE UN WHICH OFFEND US, AND IN FACT TAKE ACTION PROMPTLY WHEN
                            INFORMED, AS OUR EXPERIENCE DURING AND AFTER THE 30TH UNGA DEMONSTRATED.
                            IN OTHER SITUATIONS, REPEATED APPROACHES SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE ABOUT
                            SUCH BEHAVIOR AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL RELATIONS CAN HAVE A
                            CUMULATIVE POSITIVE EFFECT WHEN THE TIME COMES TO CHOOSE A NEW
                            REPRESENTATIVE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW RESOLUTELY INSOUCIANT OR
                            HOSTILE GOVERNMENTS, MOST COUNTRIES DO ACCEPT AT LEAST THE BASIC IDEA
                            THAT AN INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO GOVERNMENTS, WHEREVER IT OCCURS
                            GEOGRAPHICALLY, IS PROPERLY A PART OF THEIR BILATERAL RELATIONS. OUR
                            LEVERAGE IN NEW YORK IS LIMITED IN THAT WE CANNOT QUOTE DELIVER END
                            QUOTE IN A LOG ROLLING SENSE THE WAY THE LDC OR <gloss target="#t_NAG1"
                                >NAG</gloss> BLOCS CAN. WE, THEREFORE, CANNOT MATCH IN NEW YORK THE
                            INFLUENCE WE CAN EXERT BY REGULARLY CONFRONTING GOVERNMENTS IN CAPITALS
                            WITH THE NEED TO WEIGH THEIR MULTILATERAL ACTS AND INTERESTS IN THE
                            BALANCE OF THEIR BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH US. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET
                            NEW YORK PERMREPS INSTRUCTED TO BE CAREFUL OF OUR CONCERNS.</p>
                        <p>11. DON'T WE LOOK NEGATIVE IN PUTTING SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON DEFEATING
                            PROPOSALS SUCH AS ON KOREA, ISRAEL, AND PUERTO RICO? WE ARE AMONG THE
                            SMALL MINORITY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN THE UN SYSTEM.
                            THIS MEANS OFTEN BEING ON THE DEFENSIVE. BUT WE ARE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE
                            OF MANY DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AND THIS SHOULD BE EQUALLY STRESSED,
                            PARTICULARLY TO LDCS. WE HAVE ALSO MADE POSITIVE PROPOSALS ON TERRORISM,
                            TORTURE AND POLITICAL PRISONERS, BUT THESE LATTER HAVE NOT FOUND SUPPORT
                            IN THE THIRD WORLD. </p>
                        <p>12. IF WE ARE MOVING ON MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, WHY DOESN'T THIS
                            PROVIDE US THE LEVERAGE WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE RESULTS ON KEY POLITICAL
                            ISSUES? THIS FORWARD MOVEMENT DOES HELP, BUT ITS NOT ENOUGH. MANY
                            COUNTRIES--INCORRECTLY IN OUR VIEW--VIEW THIS MOVEMENT AS SOMETHING OWED
                            THEM BY THE DEVELOPED (QUOTE COLONIAL END QUOTE) POWERS. FOR THIS REASON
                            AND FOR THE REASON THAT WE CANNOT MANIPULATE, ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY
                            BASIS DEVELOPMENTAL RESOURCES IN MULTILATERAL CHANNELS, WE NEED TO DEAL,
                            AS MOST COUNTRIES DO, WITH KEY MULTILATERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AS AN
                            ASPECT OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS AS WELL.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: 30TH UNGA - THE SOVIET PERFORMANCE</p>
                        <p>1. SUMMARY: AS IN RECENT UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY (UNGA) SESSIONS,
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AGAIN TOOK DETENTE AS ITS
                            MAJOR THEME IN 30TH UNGA. THIS TIME, HOWEVER, SOVIETS STRESSED BOTH
                            POLITICAL AND MILITARY DETENTE, PUTTING EMPHASIS ON CONFERENCE ON
                            SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (<gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>) AND DISARMAMENT ISSUES. NEVERTHELESS, THE SOVIETS
                            WERE CONSISTENTLY AT ODDS WITH US ON MANY MAJOR ISSUES. EXCHANGES
                            BETWEEN CHINESE AND SOVIETS REMAINED ACRIMONIOUS. PREDICTABLY, TOO,
                            SOVIETS SOUGHT TO CARRY ON AS "CHAMPIONS" OF AFRICAN AND ARAB CAUSES.
                            END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. AS AT 28TH AND 29TH UNGA'S DETENTE WAS AGAIN THE MAJOR SOVIET THEME AT
                            30TH UNGA. IN 1975, HOWEVER, SOVIETS FOCUSED ON SUPPLEMENTING "POLITICAL
                            DETENTE" WITH "MILITARY DETENTE," PUTTING A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS ON
                            CSCE AND DISARMAMENT. FOCUS ON DISARMAMENT NOT ONLY WAS CLEAR IN GENERAL
                            DEBATE STATEMENTS BUT WAS APPARENT DURING SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION OF
                            UNGA WHERE SOVIETS LINKED NEED FOR DISARMAMENT WITH PROBLEMS OF
                            DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>3. WHILE MAINTAINING A POSTURE OF DETENTE AND COOPERATION WITH THE US,
                            PARTICULARLY ON AN ITEM SUCH AS CHARTER REVIEW, USSR ORCHESTRATED MORE
                            DETAILED AND SPECIFIC ATTACKS ON OTHER <lb/>US POSITIONS THROUGH ITS
                            ALLIES, MOST NOTICEABLY CUBA. THIS METHOD OF ATTACK VIA PROXY WAS DONE
                            LARGELY IN THIRD COMMITTEE AND ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE NOTABLE US
                            INITIATIVE FOR A GENERAL AMNESTY RESOLUTION FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS.
                            WHILE SOVIETS AND THEIR WARSAW PACT ALLIES ATTACKED US VEHEMENTLY ON
                            KOREA IN FIRST COMMITTEE, SOVIET STATEMENTS IN FIRST AND SPECIAL
                            POLITICAL COMMITTEES OFTEN WERE REPLETE WITH COMPLIMENTARY REMARKS ABOUT
                            FRUITS OF DETENTE.</p>
                        <p>4. KEEPING SUBJECT OF DETENTE VERY MUCH ALIVE THROUGHOUT SESSION, AS THEY
                            DID WITH US IN BILATERAL PRE-UNGA DISCUSSIONS LAST SUMMER, SOVIETS
                            ALLUDED TO POLICY IN GREAT DETAIL IN BOTH GENERAL DEBATE STATEMENTS.
                            NEVERTHELESS, DURING 30TH UNGA, SOVIETS WERE CONSISTENTLY AT ODDS WITH
                            US ON MOST MAJOR ISSUES, FROM VIETNAMESE <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS TO DECOLONIZATION. THEN TOO
                            SOVIET AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MJA4">MALIK</persName> MADE
                            SEVERAL PERSONAL ATTACKS ON AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"
                                >MOYNIHAN</persName>, CULMINATING WITH MALIK'S UNPRECEDENTED
                            WALK-OUT PRIOR TO MOYNIHAN'S TRADITIONAL HOST GOVERNMENT SPEECH AT CLOSE
                            OF <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> SESSION. MALIK CHARACTERIZED SPEECH
                            AS "AN UNFRIENDLY ACT."</p>
                        <p>5. DISARMAMENT. AT 30TH UNGA SOVIETS INTRODUCED TWO RATHER THAN ONE
                            "SHOWCASE" INITIATIVE: 1) A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY RESOLUTION
                                (<gloss target="#t_CTB1">CTB</gloss>), AND 2) A RESOLUTION CALLING
                            FOR PROHIBITION OF NEW MASS DESTRUCTION WEAPONS AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS
                                (<gloss target="#t_MDW1">MDW</gloss>). SOVIETS ONLY WENT THROUGH
                            MOTIONS OF PRESSING FOR SUPPORT ON CTB INITIATIVE, BUT TOOK PRO-FORMA
                            ACTION FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION, TO SET UP COMMITTEE ON
                            NON-NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATES TO PARTICIPATE IN CTB NEGOTIATIONS. ON MDW
                            INITIATIVE, SOVIETS MOUNTED A MAJOR HIGH-LEVEL, LOBBYING EFFORT WITH
                            DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ISSRAELYAN PRESSING MATTER REPEATEDLY WITH US
                            AND <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss>. IN THIS INSTANCE SOVIETS
                            ADDRESSED EC-9 AS UNIT ON POLITICAL ISSUES FOR FIRST TIME.</p>
                        <p>6. NEITHER CTB NOR MDW INITIATIVE FARED PARTICULARLY WELL BY UN
                            STANDARDS. ON CTB INITIATIVE, IN ADDITION TO EXPECTED CHINESE AND
                            ALBANIAN VOTES AGAINST RESOLUTION, 34 NATIONS ABSTAINED, INCLUDING U.S.
                            MANY EUROPEANS, AS WELL AS AFRICAN AND ASIAN NON-ALIGNED COUNTRIES.
                            SOVIETS DID SOMEWHAT BETTER ON MDW INITIATIVE WITH ONLY ALBANIA VOTING
                            AGAINST RESOLUTION (CHINA DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN VOTE) AND 15 NATIONS
                            ABSTAINING, INCLUDING US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, AND FRANCE.
                            THE GENERAL REACTION OF MANY THIRD WORLD NATIONS TO SOVIET DISARMAMENT
                            MOVES WAS ONE OF INCREASING SKEPTICISM, ALTHOUGH SOME DELEGATIONS
                            COMMENTED THAT ONE OF THE SUPERPOWERS HAD AT LEAST TAKEN AN INITIATIVE
                            ON A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN--AN OBJECTIVE SHARED BY MANY DELEGATIONS.
                            NET RESULT WAS FAVORABLE TO SOVIET IMAGE.</p>
                        <p>7. THE REQUIREMENT IN THE CTB RESOLUTION THAT NEGOTIATIONS BE ENTERED
                            INTO BY ALL FIVE NUCLEAR-WEAPON STATES PRIOR TO MARCH 31, 1976 WAS
                            PERCEIVED BY MANY DELEGATIONS AS VERY UNREALISTIC IN LIGHT OF WELL-KNOWN
                            CHINESE ATTITUDES ON THE SUBJECT.</p>
                        <p>8. OF THE 25 DISARMAMENT RESOLUTIONS, US AND SOVIET VOTING POSITION
                            COINCIDED ON 20 RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING RESOLUTION ON ROLE OF UN IN
                            DISARMAMENT ON WHICH THE SOVIETS VOTED AGAINST BUT LATER ANNOUNCED THEY
                            HAD INTENDED TO ABSTAIN. IN ADDITION TO US ABSTENTIONS ON THE TWO SOVIET
                            INITIATIVES DISCUSSED ABOUT THE US-SOVIET VOTING ALSO DIFFERED ON
                            RESOLUTIONS REGARDING: 1) DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF A
                            NUCLEAR-WEAPON-FREE ZONE, 2) PROTOCOL II OF THE TREATY OF TLATELOLCO, 3)
                            AND STRENGTHENING OF UN DISARMAMENT AFFAIRS DIVISION. HOWEVER, ON SOME
                            DISARMAMENT ISSUES OF GENUINE MUTUAL INTEREST SUCH AS RESOLUTION ON
                            ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATION, SOVIET-US COOPERATION WAS QUITE GOOD.</p>
                        <p>9. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS. POLEMICS BETWEEN USSR AND PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF
                            CHINA (<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>) CONTINUED UNABATED. ALTHOUGH
                            THE QUANTITY OF CHINESE ATTACKS ON THE "SUPERPOWERS" CLOSELY PARALLELED
                            THOSE DURING THE 29TH UNGA, THE CHINESE AT THE 30TH UNGA SEEMED TO BE
                            BEGINNING TO DEVOTE MORE TIME AND RHETORIC TO THEIR SOVIET NEIGHBOR THAN
                            TO U.S. HEIGHT OF THIS DISPUTE WAS LUSTY AND SOMETIMES SHRILL CHINESE
                            OPPOSITION TO SOVIET-PROPOSED NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY, WHICH CHINESE
                            CHARACTERIZED AS "SUPERPOWER HEGEMONY" AGAINST THIRD WORLD NATIONS, AND
                            TO ANGOLA SITUATION WHERE CHINESE HAMMERED AWAY AT SOVIET AGGRESSION AND
                            INTERVENTION. ON BOTH THESE ISSUES, CHINESE, IN ADDITION TO ATTACKING
                            SOVIET POLICIES IN DEBATE, CONDUCTED STRONG CORRIDOR CAMPAIGNS AS WELL. </p>
                        <p>10. EVEN IN MATTERS WHERE THE SOVIETS AND CHINESE WERE IN AGREEMENT, SUCH
                            AS KOREA AND ADMISSION OF TWO VIETNAMS, THERE SEEMED LITTLE EVIDENCE OF
                            COLLABORATION.</p>
                        <p>11. THE SOVIETS, IN RIGHTS OF REPLY, RIDICULED THE CHINESE, SMUGLY
                            ASSERTING THAT THEY PLUS THIRD WORLD IN GENERAL WERE THOROUGHLY BORED
                            WITH CHINESE RHETORIC.</p>
                        <p>12. DURING PERIOD OF 30TH UNGA, SOVIET-CHINESE FEUD DEGENERATED TO POINT
                            WHERE AMBASSADOR HUANG HUA KEPT SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS WAITING
                            FORTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE APPEARING FOR CONSULTATIONS ON FIRST DAY THAT
                            USSR PRESIDED OVER COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER. ALTHOUGH THESE POLEMICS CAN BE
                            AMUSING AND CAN ENLIVEN OFTEN WEARY DEBATES, MOST DELEGATIONS ARE TIRING
                            OF THE WHOLE MATTER AND NEITHER CHINESE NOR SOVIETS ARE SCORING POINTS
                            WITH THEIR TIRADES.</p>
                        <p>13. SOVIET-NON-ALIGNED RELATIONS. THE USSR AGAIN STROVE TO BE "CHAMPION"
                            OF NON-ALIGNED CAUSES. IT GAVE TOTAL SUPPORT TO DECOLONIZATION AND
                            APARTHEID RESOLUTIONS. MAJOR PROBLEMS CAME WHERE THE AFRICANS THEMSELVES
                            WERE DIVIDED OVER ISSUES SUCH AS SPANISH SAHARA AND ZIONISM. COMING DOWN
                            REGULARLY ON RADICAL SIDE OF LEDGER, SOVIETS COULD NOT PLEASE ALL.
                            FURTHERMORE, ANGOLA BROUGHT INTO OPEN AFRICAN FEARS ABOUT SOVIET
                            COLONIZATION. SOVIET EFFORTS TO CHAMPION DECOLONIZATION AND
                            SIMULTANEOUSLY TO RECOLONIZE ANGOLA UNDER AFRICAN NOSES HAVE FORCED
                            SEVERAL AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO REASSESS THEIR POSTURE VIS-A-VIS THE
                            SOVIETS. ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, SOVIETS ARE WELL AHEAD AND CLEARLY ON
                            EXPANSIONIST COURSE.</p>
                        <p>14. UNLIKE CHINA, WHICH AVOIDS TAKING POSITIONS ON AFRICAN QUESTIONS ON
                            WHICH AFRICAN STATES THEMSELVES ARE DIVIDED, USSR AT UN FEELS
                            CONSTRAINED TO HAVE FIRM POSITION ON VIRTUALLY EVERY AFRICAN ISSUE.
                            SOVIET STRATEGY HERE OBVIOUSLY IS CONSISTENT WITH MOSCOW'S ACTIVITIES ON
                            AFRICAN CONTINENT, WHICH ARE CLEARLY SUPPORTIVE OF "PROGRESSIVE"
                            ELEMENTS, AND WHICH HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE, AIMED, INTER
                            ALIA, AT SECURING CONTROL OVER INDIAN OCEAN AND SOUTH ATLANTIC SEA
                            LANES. SOVIET OFFICIALS DEALING WITH AFRICA HERE ARE SOMEWHAT RETIRING,
                            HOWEVER. PART OF REASON IS DUE TO STAFFING PROBLEMS. SOVIET AFRICAN -
                            WATCHERS IN NEW YORK ARE NOT PARTICULARLY OUTGOING. THE PRIMARILY
                            FEATHER NESTS OF THOSE WHOM THEY KNOW TO BE THEIR CLIENTS, E.G., GUINEA,
                            SOMALIA, ET AL. AT LEAST PUBLICLY, THEIR COURTING OF NATIONS SUCH AS
                            NIGERIA, WITH WHOM SOVIETS HOPE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS, IS NOT APPARENT.
                            MUCH OF SOVIET SOCIALIZING AND NEGOTIATING WITH AFRICANS IN NEW YORK IS
                            DONE BY SURROGATES FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND, AS IN ANGOLA, CUBA.</p>
                        <p>15. BY VIRTUE OF THEIR DESIRE TO TAKE FIRM POSITION ON AFRICAN AND OTHER
                            COLONIAL ISSUES, SOVIET PERFORMANCE AT 30TH UNGA WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS
                            PROBLEMS. USSR TOOK STANDARD "ANTI-COLONIALIST" POSITIONS ON BELIZE,
                            DJIBOUTI, AND OTHER TERRITORIES, BUT WAS GENUINELY IN A QUANDARY OVER
                            SPANISH SAHARA. IN WORDS OF ONE SOVIET MISSION OFFICER, SUPPORTING
                            ALGERIAN POSITION WAS TO DEFEND UNGA RESOLUTION 1514," A KHRUSHCHEV
                            INITIATIVE" "WHILE SUPPORTING MOROCCAN RESOLUTION WAS TO BACK, IN A WAY,
                                "<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">BREZHNEV</persName> DOCTRINE." MOSCOW
                            WISHED GOOD RELATIONS WITH RABAT WHILE GUARDING FRIENDLY TIES WITH
                            ALGIERS. NEVERTHELESS, GIVEN ALGERIAN PRESSURES, RELATED TO SOVIET
                            AIRCRAFT REFUELING THERE ENROUTE TO ANGOLA, SOVIETS CHANGED THEIR VOTE
                            ON MOROCCAN-INSPIRED RESOLUTION FROM AN ABSTENTION IN COMMITTEE TO A
                            "NO" IN PLENARY.</p>
                        <p>16 THE SOVIETS, BOLSTERED BY WARSAW PACT MEMBERS HAVE BEEN UNABASHED IN
                            DEFENDING THEIR ROLE AND THAT OF CUBA, IN ANGOLA, BY CLAIMING TO BE
                            SUPPORTING ANGOLA'S "LEGITIMATE" GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED
                            WITHOUT CAUSING IRRITATION TO MANY AFRICANS. BUT, AS WITH THEIR
                            INTERVENTIONS IN HUNGARY AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA, THAT IRRITATION MAY BE
                            CONSIDERED NEGLIGIBLE BY SOVIET POLICY MAKERS COMPARED TO VALUE OF PRIZE
                            THEY SEEK IN ANGOLA.</p>
                        <p>17. THE SOVIETS HAD LESS DIFFICULTIES IN VOTING RIGHT DOWN THE LINE WITH
                            THE ARABS ON ZIONISM AND MIDDLE EAST ISSUES. </p>
                        <p>18. ECONOMIC MATTERS. SOVIET UNION AND OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN SOVIEALIST
                            STATES ARE PERIPHERAL TO CENTRAL UN DEBATES ON ECONOMIC MATTERS. THIS IS
                            CASE, SINCE EASTERN EUROPEANS DO NOT BELONG TO OR DO NOT TAKE ACTIVE
                            PART IN A LARGE NUMBER OF MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH PLAY
                            IMPORTANT ROLES IN NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOVIET UNION IS
                            NOT A MEMBER OF <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> NOR OF <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, AND AS CONSEQUENCE ITS PARTICIPATION
                            IN DEBATES ON TRADE AND MONETARY QUESTIONS IN UNITED NATIONS CONTEXT ARE
                            DISTINCTLY MARGINAL TO CONCERNS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ALSO, FINANCIAL
                            CONTRIBUTIONS OF SOVIET UNION TO UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ARE
                            NOT ONLY SMALL BUT ARE MADE IN NON-CONVERTIBLE CURRENCIES. RECENTLY
                            COMPLETED UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME GOVERNING COUNCIL
                            SESSION, MAIN FOCUS OF WHICH WAS A CASH FLOW PROBLEM AFFECTING TECHNICAL
                            ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN ALL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IS GOOD EXAMPLE OF
                            PROBLEMS CREATED, IN PART, BY SOVIET UNION'S POLICY OF PARSIMONIOUS
                            CONTRIBUTIONS TO MULTILATERAL AGENCIES.</p>
                        <p>19. UPSHOT OF THIS SITUATION IS THAT ISSUES OF OVER-RIDING INTEREST IN
                            NORTH/SOUTH DEBATE ON ECONOMIC ISSUES AT UNITED NATIONS IS ONE WHICH
                            TAKES PLACE BETWEEN <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S AND THE
                            INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES WITH SOVIET UNION MERELY STANDING BY,
                            OCCASIONALLY INTERVENING TO MAKE A PROPAGANDA POINT. PERIPHERAL ROLE OF
                            THE EASTERN EUROPEANS WAS AT NO TIME MORE NOTABLE THEN AT SEVENTH
                            SPECIAL SESSION. SOCIALIST COUNTRIES UNDERTOOK NO INITIATIVES, RELYING
                            EXCLUSIVELY ON RHETORIC OF SIXTH SPECIAL SESSION AND CHARTER OF ECONOMIC
                            RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES. NONE OF SOCIALISTS WAS INCLUDED IN ANY OF
                            KEY NEGOTIATING GROUPS. THEIR PARTICIPATION IN ENTIRE SESSION WAS
                            LIMITED TO A FEW LAST-MINUTE POTSHOTS AT THE DOCUMENT NEGOTIATED BETWEEN
                            LDC'S AND KEY MEMBERS OF WESTERN COMMUNITY.</p>
                        <p>20. SOVIETS, HOWEVER, BENEFIT BY COINCIDENCE OF THEIR ECONOMIC VIEWS AND
                            THOSE OF ALMOST ALL OF MOST ACTIVE AND VOCAL OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
                            LATTER ALSO FAVOR LARGE ECONOMIC ROLE FOR STATE. UNFORTUNATELY, LDC'S
                            FAVORING MARKET ECONOMY TEND TO HANG BACK AND TO GO ALONG WITH LEADERS
                            OF <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss>. CONSEQUENTLY, RHETORIC OF THIRD
                            WORLD AND USSR ARE USUALLY MUTUALLY SUPPORTING.</p>
                        <p>21. SOVIET/CHINESE RIVALRY EXTENDS TO ECONOMIC FORUMS. WHILE TWO VIE WITH
                            ONE ANOTHER IN CURRYING FAVOR WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, PRINCIPALLY BY
                            SUPPORTING LDC DEMANDS ON DEVELOPED WORLD, CHINESE AND SOVIETS DISAGREE
                            ACRIMONIOUSLY ON SEVERAL POINTS. CHINESE LUMP SOVIETS TOGETHER WITH ALL
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS "IMPERIALIST EXPLOITERS," WHILE SOVIETS DISAVOW
                            ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLIGHT OF LDC'S. CHINESE CHARGE THE SOVIETS WITH
                            BEING HEGEMONISTS. CHINESE ALSO OPPOSE SOVIET PROPOSAL FOR 10 PER CENT
                            REDUCTION OF MILITARY BUDGETS OF PERMANENT MEMBERS OF SECURITY COUNCIL
                            (ROB) AND ITS LINK WITH AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR DEVELOPMENT. CHINESE
                            POSITION ON THESE QUESTIONS IS STATED FREQUENTLY, AND SOVIETS APPEAR
                            UNABLE TO RESIST RESPONDING TO OR BAITING CHINESE. <lb/>

                                >Scranton</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your office indicated you wanted to call Governor Scranton to indicate to
                            him in general terms some of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            issues that he might be questioned on in his upcoming contacts in the
                            Congress. The major items I think are the following (I understand that
                            he has begun contacts with State for detailed briefings):</p>
                        <p>--He will be asked if he intends to continue the tactics used by Moynihan
                            in the United Nations. Not all the Congress supported these tactics. I
                            should think Governor Scranton could respond that he intends to follow
                            the policy of the President and the Secretary and that this was the same
                            position that Ambassador Moynihan took. He can note that when the
                            President announced his nomination, the President noted we had great
                            responsibilities in the United Nations, that the Secretary's speech to
                            the Seventh Special Session made progress with the underdeveloped
                            countries, and that the policy of the U.S. of standing up against some
                            of the unfair attacks against us has been good from the point of view of
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>--In a similar vein, he will be asked what his position is on the efforts
                            of the Third World to politicize the UN in ways detrimental to the
                            United States. He can reiterate that the President has made it clear
                            that this trend disturbs us and that we intend to speak up for our
                            interests and for what we believe in. He might be asked if there is a
                            "ZAP" list in the State Department for countries who vote contrary to us
                            in the United Nations and if he approves of such a list. He should
                            indicate there is no such list, that the United States does take into
                            consideration in its bilateral relations with individual countries how
                            those countries and we relate in the multilateral field.</p>
                        <p>--He may be queried on the question of the U.S. contributions to the UN,
                            both our mandatory assessment to the UN budget and our voluntary
                            contributions to specialized agencies. There are pending in the Congress
                            some resolutions that would call for us to decrease by a small
                            percentage point on an annual basis our mandatory assessment which
                            currently is 25%. On the basis of our capacity to pay, the U.S.
                            assessment is less than that of other countries. In addition, when our
                            assessment was lowered to the 25% figure several years ago by the United
                            Nations, we agreed that we would not seek further reductions. We have
                            also taken the position that we believe our budget requests this year
                            for specialized agencies should not be cut.</p>
                        <p>--Governor Scranton may be asked about our letter of intent to withdraw
                            from the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>, whether we are serious
                            about this, or whether this is being done merely to please <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG8">George Meany</persName>. The letter of intent does
                            represent the U.S. Government's view, and in particular that of the
                            President, and that we have sent it to the ILO in the hope that
                            necessary reforms will be made in order that we can continue our
                            membership. On this subject, Governor Scranton may be asked if the U.S.
                            withdrawal from the ILO would signal a withdrawal from other UN
                            agencies. Here I think Governor Scranton should indicate that the ILO is
                            a unique agency, particularly its tripartite character, with unique
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>--He will receive questions on the efforts in the UN to take punitive
                            actions against Israel. Governor Scranton can say we will continue to
                            oppose vigorously and rally others to oppose efforts to apply sanctions
                            to, suspend or expel Israel in the United Nations and other
                            international organizations, as well as opposing efforts to equate
                            Zionism with racism.</p>
                        <p>-- On the Middle East and Cyprus, we will support the important
                            peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations in the Middle East. The
                            United Nations Emergency Force (<gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss>)
                            in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force on the

                            support for them should be continued. (Prime Minister Rabin made a

                            with respect to negotiations on Middle East questions and Cyprus, and we
                            intend to continue working closely with him.</p>

                            Nations</p>
                        <p>This memorandum reviews the main elements of the setting; it then sets
                            forth our principal working objectives; and, finally, it focuses on
                            several key problem areas offering opportunity for innovation and
                            progress toward our goals.</p>
                        <p>We think we have a fair chance of making some progress on our major
                            problems. But there will be treacherous pitfalls along the way, and
                            events external to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can have great
                            impact. We conclude, barring major upheaval like large-scale violence in
                            the Middle East-or Southern Africa, that the UN system should be able to
                            contribute positively in 1976 to the central goal advanced in your
                            address before the 30th <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>,--building
                            an international order in which the newer countries believe they possess
                            a genuine stake.</p>
                        <p>I. THE SETTING</p>
                        <p>Factors bearing on our work in the UN system are in considerable flux.
                            Many major problems remain; but some elements are shifting in our
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>--Success at the 7th Special Session significantly altered many
                            perceptions as to whether it was possible in a universal multilateral
                            forum to engage in serious dialogue, to pursue concrete initiatives, and
                            to escape the sterility of bloc confrontation. In 1974, following the
                            6th Special Session, it looked as though the economic sphere had
                            experienced the height of confrontation. But in the fall of 1975, in
                            your speech at the 30th UNGA, you praised the 7th Special Session as an
                            example of how the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> ought to pursue its
                            work. By and large this change in perceptions survived the turmoil of
                            the regular UNGA and remains thus far in the <gloss target="#t_CIEC1"
                                >CIEC</gloss> commissions and in <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                            preparations for <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>--Widening fissures have been opening in the solidarity of nonaligned
                            coalitions. Although majorities existed at the last UNGA for some highly
                            objectionable resolutions, it is probably of more long-range
                            significance that radical leaders found it increasingly difficult to
                            produce overwhelming majorities for extreme resolutions. (A more
                            detailed analysis of the "breaking up of the blocs" is attached.)</p>
                        <p>--Our intensified effort to call governments to account for irresponsible
                            actions by their representatives has hardly produced a revolution of
                            responsibility. Nevertheless, we can see some improvement, and the
                            potential for more.</p>
                        <p>--Some signs have appeared that nonaligned delegations are showing
                            dissatisfaction with their extremist leadership. For example, an
                            Algerian hardliner seeking reelection as the leader of the Group of 77
                            at <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> was supplanted by an
                            Iranian; we were told that the cause was dissatisfaction with
                            confrontational policies. Sri Lanka will be taking over leadership of
                            the nonaligned this summer in place of Algeria. There are already
                            indications that Sri Lanka intends to try, within its limits, to steer a
                            more moderate course.</p>
                        <p>--Although many had feared in early 1975 that "politicization" was a
                            spreading disease that would infect and debilitate the specialized
                            agencies, we saw throughout the year that the agencies were generally
                            continuing to perform competently their assigned technical tasks.</p>
                        <p>--There have been pluses and minuses in working with our friends. They
                            have been fairly energetic on some issues of importance, like the
                            Zionism issue. On the other hand, timidity in countering attacks and a
                            proclivity to avoid taking unpopular stands are likely to persist.</p>
                        <p>--The Security Council has been notable for serious and responsible work.
                            Its agenda has been heavy and there are some indications that Third
                            World countries may increasingly be regarding it as a vital arena for
                            conflict resolution diplomacy.</p>
                        <p>But despite these generally favorable elements, the fundamental features
                            of the problem remain. We are dealing in the UN framework with countries
                            deeply dissatisfied with the cards they were dealt when they became
                            nations. Their impatience to narrow gulfs of inequality, to remove
                            quickly what they regard as fundamental injustices, will ensure that it
                            remains a formidable task to muster support for what may actually be
                            feasible,--gradual, partial, practical measures.</p>
                        <p>In this environment, we face some far-reaching and intellectually
                            challenging questions:</p>
                        <p>--Can a strengthened U.S. multilateral diplomatic effort produce more
                            than ephemeral and token changes,--the shifting of a few votes? Can it
                            engender a significant and lasting increase in responsibility in the way
                            governments approach multilateral enterprises?</p>
                        <p>--Can our leadership in dealing with global development problems, which
                            we seized at the 7th Special Session through an arresting and
                            unprecedented array of proposals, be sustained as easier steps are
                            accomplished and more intractable problems come to the fore? Will
                            constraints on our freedom of action in an election year be minor or
                            decisive?</p>
                        <p>--Can we continue to use the UN, and particularly the Security Council,
                            to reinforce the thrust of our major diplomatic initiatives, as
                            peacekeeping decisions have done in the Middle East? Or, will conditions
                            outside the UN, such as a glacial pace in Middle East negotiations,
                            produce dramatic steps, like exclusion of Israel from the General
                            Assembly, which would put at risk the future of the UN itself?</p>
                        <p>--Will the American public and the Congress perceive that multilateral
                            forums, including the UN system, despite their difficulties, offer
                            unique opportunities to advance U.S. approaches to the management-of
                            global problems? Or, will there be a withdrawal of essential support,
                            including severe reductions in contributions, which could cripple our
                            capability?</p>
                        <p>II. OBJECTIVES </p>
                        <p>Our most important working objectives for this year are the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>--Protect and strengthen the effectiveness, responsibility, and prestige
                            of the Security Council, which will remain for the United States the
                            paramount body within the UN system.</p>
                        <p>--Build up our new operational capacity to relate multilateral and
                            bilateral diplomacy, so that we create more incentives and deterrents to
                            promote more responsible behavior in international organizations, less
                            gratuitous hostility, greater readiness to deal with issues on their
                            individual merits, continued erosion of bloc voting, and overall, more
                            support for U.S. positions on critical issues.</p>
                        <p>--Develop more effective means of concerting with our allies, both to
                            enhance support for our positive initiatives and to defend more
                            staunchly Western interests when they are subjected to irresponsible or
                            hostile attack.</p>
                        <p>--Maintain the initiative in dealing with issues of economic
                            interdependence and global development which we seized at the 7th
                            Special Session.</p>
                        <p>--Pursue throughout the UN system what is essentially a functional
                            approach, by taking initiatives and promoting projects in areas where
                            broad mutual interests exist and common benefits can be realized,
                            thereby gradually expanding the area of consensus and increasing the
                            common stake in an effective UN system.</p>
                        <p>--Work to strengthen specialized agencies as organizations where serious,
                            competent work is done on their assigned technical, economic, and social
                            missions.</p>
                        <p>--Continue in the General Assembly and elsewhere to counter firmly and
                            forcefully when we are attacked, both to show others that cheap shots
                            are not cost-free and to maintain support and confidence from the
                            American public.</p>
                        <p>--Promote sound proposals to improve the structure and functioning of the
                            United Nations, including the goals we advanced at the Seventh Special
                            Session for restructuring the economic and social side of the UN's
                            work.</p>
                        <p>--Intensify our efforts with Congress and the public to maintain
                            essential support, particularly financial support, for activities within
                            the United Nations system.</p>
                        <p>III. MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS</p>
                        <p>A. Development of more effective multilateral diplomacy. Our efforts will
                            have wide sweep:</p>
                        <p>--Covering both political and economic issues;</p>
                        <p>--Affecting not merely relations with LDCs, but also with our friends and
                            allies,--in order to stiffen spines;</p>
                        <p>--Dealing not solely with the UNGA, where difficulties have been most
                            notorious, but also with the specialized agencies where practical
                            reasons for promoting responsible diplomacy are especially
                            compelling.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the year, we will be testing some innovative, and we
                            hope productive, concepts:</p>
                        <p>(1) Development of incentives and mutual goals. Through a more continuous
                            dialogue between our embassies and foreign ministries, it should be
                            possible to acquire a better catalogue of the goals of individual
                            countries, both LDCs and allies, within multilateral organizations. This
                            would cover not only major substantive interests, but also relatively
                            minor objectives, like the desire to serve on various committees. We
                            should then be better able to identify some realistic "carrots",--early
                            offers of US support--, which can be brought to bear to influence
                            behavior. (We would also, of course, be identifying potential
                            "sticks",--the withholding of our support in the event of uncooperative
                            behavior.) This approach can have several advantages:</p>
                        <p>--It would be more usable (and therefore more credible) than many of the
                            threats we have heretofore considered, because it would involve
                            retribution of a comparable order of magnitude and because there would
                            be a closer relationship between the offense (misbehavior at the UN) and
                            our response (withholding or granting of support at the UN).</p>
                        <p>--It could apply to large and influential countries as well as to weak
                            ones. An anomaly and flaw in our approach to date has been that
                            countries most responsible for causing us difficulties in the UN system,
                            like Algeria and Mexico, are exempted from threats of retaliation
                            because, quite properly, we cannot prejudice larger interests involved
                            in our relationships outside the UN.</p>
                        <p>--Our allies, who particularly need our support to gain their ends within
                            the UN system, might find it increasingly in their interest to be more
                            staunchly supportive if they found that our staunchness in behalf of
                            their causes, while offered generously, was not immutable.</p>
                        <p>(2) Encouragement of greater responsibility. Throughout the UN system,
                            many representatives receive only very general instructions,--"stick
                            with the nonaligned group". As a result, many have felt free to play
                            whatever role, constructive or destructive, which they find congenial
                            and personally rewarding. This affects many activities,--drafting
                            resolutions, proposing amendments, leading the opposition in
                            negotiations, taking the floor to make extreme statements,--all of which
                            can have an important effect, not only on the climate of a meeting, but
                            on the shape of the final vote.</p>
                        <p>By more frequent and earlier contacts with foreign offices, some of our
                            embassies, better armed with substantive arguments, should be able to
                            encourage the issuance of more detailed instructions. Protesting
                            irresponsible or gratuitously hostile behavior should gradually bring
                            home to foreign ministers that a new standard of care and involvement is
                            required if governments want to avoid burdening their bilateral
                            relations with us merely because of free-wheeling activities by a UN
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>An essential supporting element in this effort will, of course, be more
                            detailed monitoring of how representatives of countries conduct
                            themselves in a myriad of UN activities, not merely at the time of
                            voting. <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> has begun more detailed
                            reporting of this sort. We will also be establishing this approach
                            throughout the system.</p>
                        <p>(3) Improved selection of issues for major diplomatic efforts. It is
                            crucially important that we select very carefully, and as far in advance
                            as possible, those issues which are so vital that we warn other
                            governments that their votes may affect our bilateral relations. We must
                            keep in mind that we often have a choice whether U.S. interests are
                            better served by staging a major campaign in order to lessen the size of
                            a majority against us (and also to show that we cannot be rolled over
                            easily) or, alternatively, whether it is more in our interest to hold
                            back and deprive our opponents of the fruits of a more dramatic victory
                            which results when we go to the mat but lose decisively anyway.</p>
                        <p>Such choices obviously cannot be made in the abstract. However, we should
                            preserve, and be prepared occasionally to utilize, the option of
                            disregarding some votes even before they take place. UNGA resolutions,
                            except those dealing with budgetary and administrative issues, are only
                            recommendations. Some are important; some are not. We should be wary of
                            falling into the trap of attaching enormous importance to an issue
                            before a vote, and only after it is lost saying that the resolution is
                            of little practical significance because we are ignoring it.</p>
                        <p>B. Selective non-participation in UN activities.</p>
                        <p>During the past year we have gained some advantage through a more
                            flexible approach to participation,--declining to participate in some
                            activities which we did not support and did not think could have any
                            useful results:</p>
                        <p>--During consideration of the UNGA resolution equating Zionism and
                            racism, we announced that we would not participate in any activities
                            directly falling under the "Decade to Combat Racism". Although this did
                            not stop the Assembly from adopting the resolution, we believe our firm
                            stand gave the Africans, in particular, second thoughts about the wisdom
                            of letting a situation develop in which over the longer term they lose
                            more than they gain.</p>
                        <p>--A more specific illustration occurred recently when we instructed our
                            UNESCO representative to inform the Director General that we would not
                            participate in a meeting of experts to draft a UNESCO declaration on
                            racism. The meeting was postponed. Although we cannot be sure of precise
                            cause and effect, since there was also considerable dissatisfaction on
                            the part of others, the effect was clearly salutary.</p>
                        <p>There is a wide spectrum of situations to which non-participation might
                            be applicable, and in every case we will have to weigh carefully whether
                            we stand more to lose or gain by staying away. As a general matter,
                            however, selective non-participation in appropriate cases can
                            demonstrate forcefully that all elements of the UN system are not of
                            equal importance to us, that we will not passively go along with any UN
                            enterprise no matter how ill-conceived,--and at the same time
                            non-participation can be carried out without indicating that we are
                            washing our hands of the UN as a whole. There are likely to be more
                            situations in 1976 in which we will wish to recommend U.S.
                            non-participation.</p>
                        <p>C. Maintaining global economic leadership.</p>
                        <p>In our view, there remains a large opening for United States leadership
                            in promoting realistic measures. A few LDCs may feel somewhat safer and
                            stronger as the world economy revives, and consequently less disposed
                            toward compromise; but most LDCs will continue to confront gigantic and
                            sobering difficulties clearly unmanageable by their own efforts and will
                            see value in effective cooperation. In this situation, we think the US
                            approach, both in the UN and related forums, should include these
                            elements:</p>
                        <p>--Concrete proposals. No factor was more crucial to success at the
                            Seventh Special Session than our ability to put forth specific action
                            proposals. We need not propose again this year such a sweeping and
                            comprehensive list of new initiatives. However, we have by no means
                            exhausted the opportunities for imaginative refinements or a few new
                            elements within the vast realm of subjects comprehended by the Special
                            Session, and now by the CIEC. The UNCTAD ministerial meeting in May will
                            require the United States to make some specific new proposals. The tone
                            and concreteness of our approach to UNCTAD will be a major determinant
                            of the political atmosphere throughout the UN system this year.</p>
                        <p>--Promoting the U.S. philosophy. We also learned from the Special Session
                            that we must undertake sustained efforts to win our points. The Special
                            Session was not the result of a quick master stroke. A vital ingredient
                            was the long, almost continuous series of major speeches which you
                            delivered, and our supporting diplomatic contacts, hammering away at
                            fundamental propositions which gradually began to take hold. Within the
                            UN system, we intend to use the many meetings on economic and
                            development subjects as occasions for continuing this same kind of
                            patient approach. At a recent meeting of the UN Development Program's
                            governing council, for example, the United States delivered a major
                            presentation based on our Special Session initiatives and their
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>--Preserving flexibility to utilize different forums. It is important
                            that we encourage others to join with us in serious negotiations in
                            limited, technical forums. We will have to formulate positions on
                            complex relationships between many of these bodies and the major organs
                            of the UN system. In this process, we will best serve our basic purposes
                            if we avoid locking horns with the LDCs over whether various parts of
                            the UN system, such as the GA, the UNCTAD, or the <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, should be permitted to hold
                            discussions, to record judgments, to develop guidelines, about important
                            issues. We saw in the Special Session that we can exert enough influence
                            to prevent UNGA debates from prejudicing what we want to do elsewhere in
                            limited or specialized forums. In fact, the Special Session promoted
                            what we want to do elsewhere. We should continue this approach, which
                            concentrates on substance and persuasion and education, as opposed to
                            getting sidetracked with jurisdictional struggles that we are likely to
                            lose anyway.</p>
                        <p>--Putting further behind us the "New International Economic Order" and
                            the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties. It will simply not be in our
                            power to extirpate the symbolic appeal <gloss target="#t_NIEO1"
                                >NIEO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CERDS1">CERDS</gloss> have
                            acquired. We can, however, try gradually to neutralize their political
                            effect by maintaining momentum on practical steps of the sort we favor.
                            This type of approach would have been harmed at the Special Session, and
                            would be harmed in future major meetings like the UNCTAD, if we
                            permitted others to engage us in bitter struggles over essentially
                            ritualistic formulas regarding the NIEO and the CERDS. We should do
                            everything in our power to avoid conflict with the LDCs over legalistic
                            formulas, as opposed to concentrating on the merits of concrete
                            substantive proposals.</p>
                        <p>D. Human Rights.</p>
                        <p>In the last two years, we have been increasingly assertive regarding
                            human rights,--presenting two initiatives on torture, adopting a much
                            more forthcoming stand on UN investigative procedures, voting our
                            convictions regarding abuses in Chile, and launching the amnesty
                            initiative. We will be presented both with opportunities and
                            difficulties:</p>
                        <p>--Our principal opportunity will be to bear down on achieving modest but
                            significant practical gains, like the strengthening of UN human rights
                            machinery, and possibly achievement of our initiative to establish an
                            experts group to study torture objectively.</p>
                        <p>--We should continue to speak out against double standards and in behalf
                            of certain fundamental propositions, for example, that people should not
                            be incarcerated for their political beliefs. But, we should try to avoid
                            proceeding in a way which seems to .result in "defeats" for us and
                            "victories" for those who oppose us.</p>
                        <p>--Overall, our increasingly active participation in UN human rights work
                            offers us an opportunity to respond to Congressional pressures for a
                            more forward US posture,--in a setting which engenders less resentment
                            than would U.S. pressure on friendly governments in a purely bilateral
                            framework.</p>
                        <p>E. Public perceptions at the United Nations and the problem of Israeli
                            exclusion.</p>
                        <p>Public support for the UN seems to be declining sharply. This
                            disenchantment is likely to he reflected in reduced Congressional
                            support for our financial contributions to various UN activities. Even
                            as to our basic UN assessed dues, a larger number of Congressmen than in
                            many years are introducing draft legislation that would arbitrarily cut
                            the US contribution Ceiling drastically below the present 25 per
                            cent.</p>
                        <p>Although the public perception of our difficulties at the UN has greatly
                            heightened, the objective facts regarding UN performance have not
                            basically changed. We intend to intensify our efforts to explain to the
                            American people the many ways in which various parts of the UN system
                            directly serve American interests. We can also validly begin saying that
                            a more assertive approach to participation in the UN is paying some
                            practical dividends. Most Americans and the Congress are much more
                            likely to continue to support our efforts, and pay for them, if they
                            feel we are not engaged in a virtually hopeless struggle.</p>
                        <p>The wild card in the pack, however, could well be the question of Israeli
                            participation in the General Assembly. Last year, a plan led by Arab
                            extremists to exclude Israel from the GA, using the South African model,
                            was aborted largely because of Egypt's influence and the reluctance of
                            African moderates. There have been some indications that the Syrians are
                            again considering a diplomatic offensive on this issue during the
                            summer. If political or military conflict in Southern Africa escalates
                            sharply, such an effort would have a much better chance of succeeding.
                            Many African governments would then be loath to withhold their support
                            for the Arab cause in fear that the Arabs would not support them in the
                            struggle which they regard as transcendent. And if an effort to exclude
                            Israel were successful in this election year (or even if it came close
                            to succeeding), the reaction of the American people and Congress against
                            the United. Nations itself could be devastating.</p>
                        <p>Because of the enormous importance of this issue, we are planning to
                            conduct discussions with a large number of nonaligned countries
                            throughout the year to try to influence their views before they attend
                            various regional and other nonaligned meetings at which participants may
                            be pressured to lock themselves into a unified position. We will argue
                            that a move to expel Israel would create the gravest possible threat to
                            the viability of the organization, and that the precedent of trying to
                            "punish" a relatively small country for unpopular policies could bite
                            back at almost any small country which in the future may find itself in
                            serious disfavor with the majority.</p>
                        <p>If you visit Africa this spring, your meetings with key African moderates
                            could well tip the balance against any such Arab initiative,--and the
                            topic should certainly be on your agenda.</p>
                        <p>Although the challenge is formidable, there is nevertheless a reasonable
                            chance of making headway this year towards our goals,--assuming there
                            are no major international upheavals. This does not mean that the UN
                            will be transformed into a congenial arena for realizing American
                            objectives. It will not. We cannot expect an end to hostile initiatives
                            and offensive rhetoric. But we can reasonably hope to see increasing
                            seriousness and responsibility in the way at least some governments
                            approach multilateral problems.</p>
                        <p>Our intensified effort to bring to bear more effectively our diplomatic
                            resources and to tackle systematically the substance of North-South
                            economic problems is having some positive impact. Quick or total mastery
                            of our difficulties certainly is not possible,--but gradual improvement
                            should be.</p>

                        <p>Trends Report<lb/>The Future of the Security Council</p>
                        <p>The Council has been exceptionally busy; but beyond that, the kinds of
                            items which come before it, the way it is handling them, and the role of
                            the smaller powers, may all indicate an evolution of importance to us.
                            In sum, the Council may be growing as a significant arena for carrying
                            out conflict resolution diplomacy, particularly related to regional
                            disputes; and the smaller countries may increasingly be perceiving the
                            Council as Part of a world structure in which they can play a meaningful
                            role. There are also, however, some substantial risks inherent in the
                            current developments.</p>
                        <p>In this memorandum, we describe the key things that have been happening,
                            point out the main risks, and outline the factors that seem positive
                            from our standpoint.</p>
                        <p>1. What has been happening? These are the key trends:</p>
                        <p>--During recent months, the Council has been busier than it has been in
                            any comparable period during the last 10 years. The total of 38 meetings
                            on 8 topics during the first three months of this year is well over
                            twice the average number in the same period in any single year since
                            1967. It seems virtually certain, based on what we can now foresee that
                            the present year is likely to be the heaviest in a decade--even if there
                            is no major conflict which preoccupies the Council.</p>
                        <p>--The explanation lies partly in the fact that this year there are
                            heightened pressures to "solve" long-standing issues in Southern Africa
                            and the Middle East. The rising status of revolutionary regimes and
                            movements in both areas also contributes to increased diplomatic
                            pressures, including by recourse to the Security Council, in order to
                            achieve gains which would be more costly if pursued purely through
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>--The Council is also being utilized increasingly as an arena for
                            considering some of the smaller regional disputes, like the Comoros
                            Islands, Iceland's complaint against the UK, the border incident at
                            Djibouti, Spanish Sahara, and Timor. This development may well be a
                            function of the general receding of East-West conflict from center
                            stage.</p>
                        <p>--A gradual shift has continued away from the great powers playing the
                            most central and active diplomatic roles, to a situation in which the
                            medium-sized powers, particularly the non-aligned Council members,
                            generally initiate items, float resolutions, and conduct negotiations.
                            Although we have assets which can be utilized, neither we nor our
                            friends are now predominant actors.</p>
                        <p>--While we can no longer consistently manage satisfactory outcomes, the
                            Soviet role is not predominant either, despite their recent political
                            gains in Southern Africa and their support of the radical Arabs. We
                            think that Soviet influence may, if anything, be declining. Radicals
                            probably tend to assume Soviet support for almost any "non-aligned
                            cause"; and moderates have little expectation of finding help through
                            constructive Soviet inputs, as opposed, for example, to those of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or Sweden. So there is neither
                            much need, nor advantage, in seeking to "negotiate" with the Soviets.
                            Moreover, Soviet prestige has undoubtedly declined as a result of the
                            unproductive, predictable, and often embarrassing verbal fracases
                            between them and the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>--The Council's way of doing its business has generally become more
                            serious and responsible. Although there are still rhetorical excesses at
                            Council meetings and some arbitrary pushing of extreme language to the
                            vote, a large amount of the Council's business is carried out in
                            relatively careful and quiet corridor negotiations.</p>
                        <p>--Our exercise of the veto has become an accepted feature of the
                            diplomatic landscape. People may differ on whether in a particular case
                            we utilize our veto judiciously, but the important factor, it seems to
                            us, is the general absence of moral outrage or hostility toward us when
                            we do use it. On Middle East issues, however, frequent use of the veto
                            could strengthen the hand of radical Arabs as against moderates, and
                            heighten interest in turning to General Assembly Uniting-For-Peace
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>2. What are the dangers and uncertainties in this evolving situation?
                            There are shoals which lie ahead:</p>
                        <p>--Recourse to the Council can be abused by extremists or by impatient and
                            inexperienced governments. Radical Arabs, sometimes instigated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, can bring frivolous or
                            harassing cases against Israel. Regarding the recent case involving
                            South African presence in Angola, we almost succeeded in avoiding the
                            holding of an unnecessary meeting, since South African presence was
                            being terminated; but radical African attitudes and an inability of
                            moderates to control the situation, led to a somewhat sour ending.</p>
                        <p>-- We can expect that non-aligned countries, especially the radicals,
                            will try to use the threat, and the actuality, of Security Council
                            meetings to exert diplomatic pressures on us. In particular, the Arabs
                            will attempt to use Council meetings as a means of stimulating us to
                            push Israel to make concessions. And, as in the past, we will continue
                            to some extent to be vulnerable to efforts to isolate us from our
                            Western friends.</p>
                        <p>--There will be continuing risk of a breakdown of the present Security
                            Council system as a result of rebellion against the special status and
                            power of the permanent members. There has been discussion of possible
                            Arab or African attempts to move issues to the General Assembly when
                            blocked in the Council, using the Uniting-For-Peace procedures. Since
                            these procedures were earlier developed at American initiative, we would
                            face at the very least an awkward situation if the General Assembly
                            recommended peacekeeping forces or even enforcement measures with
                            respect to Israel or Namibia which we had vetoed in the Council. We do
                            not assess this risk as very great at the moment, but whether it grows
                            or recedes will, of course, depend at least partly on progress outside
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>--Greater use of the Council for smaller regional disputes could raise
                            question of whether the Council's "coinage" would be degraded, or even
                            whether the system might become clogged in much the same way that
                            General Assembly committees have become burdened with vast amounts of
                            trivial business. These are fair questions; however, we do not believe
                            that these risks outweigh the advantage in a larger number of UN members
                            believing that the Security Council is part of a system which can help
                            them in meeting their security needs. Moreover, there does not yet seem
                            to be any serious problem of finding time to conduct a great deal more
                            Security Council business.</p>
                        <p>3. Are there aspects of the Present situation which are positive from our
                            standpoint? We think there are three broad aspects which can be in our
                            long-term interests:</p>
                        <p>--The Council seems increasingly to be viewed as a usable part of a much
                            larger diplomatic process. We, ourselves, have often pointed out that
                            maintenance of Middle East peacekeeping forces permits the parties to
                            gain time and to preserve negotiating options. There are many other ways
                            in which the Security Council can interrelate with a larger diplomatic
                            process. For example, even the prospect of a Council meeting can lead
                            interested countries to take steps and undertake negotiations which they
                            might not otherwise, as in the case of the private discussions which
                            facilitated South Africa's withdrawal from Angola. It seems to us
                            healthy and realistic that the Council is being viewed less and less as
                            a judicial or administrative organ, which somehow fails unless it
                            disposes definitively of the problems brought before it.</p>
                        <p>--Greater recourse to the Security Council, even by radicals bent on
                            creating pressures against us and our friends, is preferable to pursuit
                            of extreme objectives exclusively through violence. Although the
                            pressures stimulated by the radicals may often be uncomfortable and even
                            offensive, it will generally be easier to keep negotiations going and to
                            protect our own interests to the extent that there is not a pervasive
                            backdrop of violence.</p>
                        <p>--Finally, smaller countries increasingly see the Council as part of a
                            structure in which they can effectively participate. Over-all we believe
                            it is encouraging that the Council's activities are generally being
                            carried out in a way that promotes the broad goal which you set forth in
                            your last General Assembly speech--the building of a world system in
                            which both the large and the small powers have a genuine stake.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to predict whether there will be positive evolution or
                            deterioration in the Security Council in the future. Much will depend on
                            events outside the United Nations. And we cannot control whether others
                            act responsibly or irresponsibly. But we still have it in our power
                            through our own behavior to make a significant impact on the shaping of
                            Security Council work. Factors of importance will include:</p>
                        <p>--Whether we continue in appropriate major cases to carry out diplomatic
                            consultations in advance--such as those which you directed prior to this
                            January's Middle East debate--consultations that can either
                            significantly increase our chances of achieving acceptable results or
                            minimize the risk of damaging repercussions when a satisfactory outcome
                            cannot be achieved.</p>
                        <p>--Whether we are able to concert successfully with friends in order to
                            prevent our antagonists from isolating us.</p>
                        <p>--Whether we exploit skillfully the opportunities which may exist to
                            influence Council negotiations, particularly with the help of our
                            friends, in order to strengthen the feeling of most participants that
                            the Council is a forum to be taken seriously and in order to prevent
                            extremists from demonstrating that our participation is limited to
                            casting a veto.</p>
                        <p>--Whether we are able to hold our use of the veto to those situations
                            where it is essential to protect our own vital national interests.</p>
                        <p>While the extent of progress in the future cannot be predicted, the
                            stakes that face us are clear. If the present Security Council system
                            breaks down, for example as a result of confrontational use of
                            Uniting-For-Peace procedures, we might never be able again to
                            re-establish a structure in which we have the same recognized powers
                            that we now possess. But of even more importance, the present situation,
                            however uncertain, holds some potential of the Security Council becoming
                            an increasingly flexible and useful element of the international
                            diplomatic system.</p>

                        <p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT BEFORE TAKING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN FOLLOWING <gloss

                            GOVERNMENTS HAVE GOTTEN A CLEAR SIGNAL ON ISSUES OF KEY CONCERN TO US

                            FONMINS WILL ADDRESS IS PROBABLY ALREADY, IN ITS EARLIER DRAFT FORM, IN
                            THE HANDS OF MOST NAM GOVERNMENTS. THE ANNOTATIONS HAVE NO
                            RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS STAGE. IF CONFRONTATIONAL POSITIONS ARE ENDORSED
                            AT ALGIERS ON KEY ISSUES IT WILL BE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ENCOURAGE
                            MODERATE NAMS TO SEEK TO MODIFY THESE POSITIONS BETWEEN ALGIERS AND

                        <p>A. THRUST OF ANNOTATION ON PUERTO RICO IS THAT PUERTO RICO REMAINS ONE OF
                            THE MAIN ENCLAVES OF COLONIALISM IN LATIN AMERICA; THAT THIS STATUS HAS
                            BEEN RECOGNIZED BY VARIOUS NON-ALIGNED MEETINGS WHICH HAVE REAFFIRMED
                            THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO FOR
                            INDEPENDENCE; THAT THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> COMMITTEE OF 24
                            HAS REPEATEDLY EXAMINED THE SITUATION AND REAFFIRMED THE INALIENABLE

                            INDEPENDENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 1514 (XV).

                        <p>B. THE ANNOTATION ON KOREA RECOUNTS THE NON-ALIGNED POSITION ON KOREA AT
                            ALGIERS, HAVANA AND LIMA. ALGIERS RESOLUTION IN 1973 CALLED FOR
                            WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN TROOPS STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA, AN END TO
                            FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN ALL ITS FORMS IN THE DOMESTIC AFFAIRS OF KOREA
                            AND DECLARED THAT ADMISSION OF KOREA TO THE UN SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL
                            AFTER COMPLETE UNIFICATION OR AFTER ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONFEDERATION OF
                            NORTH AND SOUTH. MARCH 1975 HAVANA MEETING AFFIRMED POLICY OF
                            INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL UNIFICATION OF KOREA, CALLED FOR WITHDRAWAL OF
                            ALL FOREIGN TROOPS STATIONED SOUTH KOREA AND ENDORSED APPLICATION OF
                            NORTH KOREA FOR NAM MEMBERSHIP. AT LIMA 1975 NORTH KOREA WAS ADMITTED TO
                            MEMBERSHIP IN THE NAM. LIMA MEETING REAFFIRMED SUPPORT FOR POLICY OF
                            INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF KOREA, DEMANDED WITHDRAWAL OF
                            ALL FOREIGN TROOPS STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA UNDER UN FLAG AND
                            REPLACEMENT OF ARMISTICE AGREEMENT WITH PEACE AGREEMENT; EXPRESSED HOPE
                            NORTH AND SOUTH OF KOREA WOULD OBSERVE THREE PRINCIPLES OF NATIONAL
                            REUNIFICATION STIPULATED IN NORTH-SOUTH STATEMENT OF JULY 4, 1972.
                            ANNOTATION CONCLUDES WITH REFERENCE TO ADOPTION OF TWO RESOLUTIONS BY
                            30TH <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> WITHOUT FURTHER ELABORATION.
                            FYI. BIAS OF ANNOTATION IN FAVOR OF NORTH KOREA WILL BE CLEAR FROM STATE

                        <p>C. ANNOTATION ON MIDDLE EAST IS LENGTHY AND STRONGLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL
                            FOR ALLEGEDLY OBSTRUCTING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FOR SUPPRESSING
                            PALESTINIAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS. IT ACCUSES US OF SUPPORTING
                            ISRAELI EFFORTS TO BLOCK REAL PROGRESS IN SEARCH FOR JUST AND
                            COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT. THRUST OF ANNOTATION IS TO PUT SOLUTION OF
                            MIDDLE EAST QUESTION IN UN CONTEXT REJECTING STEP-BY-STEP DIPLOMACY.
                            ANNOTATION DOES NOT EXPLICITLY RAISE THE ISSUE OF SUSPENSION OF ISRAEL
                            FROM THE UN BUT RATHER WARNS THAT ISRAELI VIOLATIONS OF UN CHARTER SO
                            PERSISTENT THAT NAM COUNTRIES SHOULD CONSIDER MEASURES AGAINST ISRAEL IN
                            CONFORMITY WITH CHAPTER VII OF UN CHARTER. UNGA RESOLUTION ON ZIONISM AS
                            RACISM NOT CITED IN ANNOTATION BUT THERE IS REFERENCE TO HAVANA MEETING
                            CONDEMNATION OF ZIONISM AS THREAT TO WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY AND CALL
                            UPON ALL COUNTRIES TO OPPOSE THIS RACIST IMPERIALIST IDEOLOGY. (FYI.
                            BECAUSE ISRAELI SUSPENSION IS NOT DIRECTLY MENTIONED AND BECAUSE ZIONISM
                            AS RACISM IS AMBIGUOUSLY TREATED IN THE ANNOTATION, POSTS HAVE BEEN
                            REQUESTED IN STATE 110462 NOT RPT NOT TO USE THE TALKING POINTS IN STATE
                            108501 AT THIS TIME UNLESS THE ISSUE IS RAISED BY HOST GOVERNMENT IN
                            COURSE OF CONVERSATIONS; END FYI.)</p>
                        <p>3. ABOVE ANNOTATIONS SHOULD NOT BE EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED AS THEY HAVE NOT
                            BEEN MADE PUBLIC. THEY ARE SUMMARIZED HEREIN IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE VIEW
                            OF THESE PROBLEMS NAM MEMBERS BEING PROVIDED BY NACC.</p>
                        <p>4. POSTS IN COUNTRIES BELONGING TO NAM (ESPECIALLY TO NACC OF NAM) ARE
                            REQUESTED TO REVIEW POST ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO REFTELS RELATING TO
                            KOREA, AND PUERTO RICO, AND CONSIDER WHAT ACTIONS DURING NEXT TEN DAYS,
                            BEFORE POSITIONS ARE FIRMED UP FOR NACC FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING, WOULD
                            MOST EFFECTIVELY UNDERLINE TO HOST GOVERNMENT CONCERNS OUTLINED THEREIN.
                            IF HOST GOVTS ARE TO EXPRESS DESIRED RESERVATIONS ABOUT THEM, IT IS
                            IMPORTANT THEY DO SO PRIOR TO THAT MEETING, OR, IF THEY ARE NACC MEMBERS
                            AT THE MEETING. POSTS IN COMMITTEE OF 24 COUNTRIES NEED NO LONGER
                            OBSERVE CAVEATS IN STATE 49329 BUT MAY DISCUSS PUERTO RICO IN NAM
                            CONTEXT REFUTING CUBAN CHARACTERIZATION OF PUERTO RICAN PROBLEM.</p>
                        <p>5. POSTS SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT DEPARTMENT IS NOT RPT NOT SEEKING VOTES OR
                            PROMISE OF SUPPORT ON KEY ISSUES AT THIS TIME ALTHOUGH EXPRESSIONS OF
                            SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY ARE WELCOME. PRESENT EFFORT IS BEST DESCRIBED AS
                            CAMPAIGN AGAINST CONFRONTATION IN 31ST UNGA BY IMPRESSING ON NAM
                            COUNTRIES IMPORTANCE THESE KEY ISSUES TO US AND ONE-SIDEDNESS OF
                            PREVIOUS NAM FORMULATIONS. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE NAM COUNTRIES,
                            PARTICULARLY MODERATES, TO CONSIDER ISSUES ON MERITS AND WHETHER

                        <p>6. IN CONSIDERING WHAT FURTHER STATEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE AND AT WHAT
                            LEVEL IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THIS RESULT, NAM POSTS MAY WISH, WHERE
                            APPROPRIATE, TO PLACE DISCUSSION OF POLITICAL ISSUES WHICH THEY HAVE

                        <p>Governor Scranton: There are two subjects I want to talk about. First, I
                            am going to Africa, as you know. Do you have any suggestions or
                            advice?</p>

                        <p>Scranton: I will be going to most of the places you haven't been, with
                            the exception of Tanzania, Senegal and Zambia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Aren't you going to Botswana? Why not? I am concerned that
                            both you and I have skipped this. Can't you see if you can make it?</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Okay, let's try it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Fine.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Do you have any special messages that you want me to
                            deliver?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I was told by Foreign Minister Wills this morning that it's
                            hard for Africans to understand how we conduct foreign policy. They
                            think that just because the "super-chief" states a policy, it is
                            automatically carried out. They don't understand our political process.
                            It would help if you could explain to them that this is a tough year in
                            the United States because of the elections, and if you can tell them
                            what is involved in piecing our policies together and in implementing
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Okay then, I will talk about the implementation of policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Is <persName corresp="#p_STW1">Seelye</persName> going with
                            you? I would like that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWEJ1">Schaufele</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I want you to know something, and Bill here understands what I
                            mean. The African Bureau is populated by a bunch of zealots who felt
                            ostracized for a long time and who felt that Africa was being ignored.
                            This is combined with the fact that in our Embassies the officers
                            thought their jobs consisted of holding the hands of the local leaders
                            and telling them what a great role Africa can play. It is my impression
                            that moving with a certain majesty impresses the African leadership. It
                            is important that you appeal to them not on the basis of altruism or
                            idealism but that what we will be doing we are undertaking in our own
                            interest. You have to make clear to them that we will not do it their
                            way, through intervention. They have to understand that we have to put
                            the pieces together. Nyerere is a sophisticated person, he understands
                            this and so does Kaunde. I told Nyerere privately that if Cuban troops
                            appear that he can be assured we will find a way to stop them. You also
                            don't want to give the Africans the impression that you will try to
                            split them. I told them that we would keep out ourselves but that we
                            will expect others to stay out as well. To show you the wrong direction
                            they can take, the fools defeated us in Nairobi. They got a
                            parliamentary victory but instead of having progressed, there is a
                            stalemate. In talking to the leaders, you can also tell them that in an
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> meeting it is in their interest
                            not to come out with anti-American statements. This could lead to a bad
                            reaction here. If they could possibly come out with some pro-American
                            statement, it will have a tremendous impact here. Nyerere, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KKD1">Kaunda</persName> and Bongo will understand
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: What should I say at <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                            >ECOSOC</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Give them hell about Nairobi. If you compare where we were and
                            where we are now in development policy, we have made monumental
                            progress. A year ago, if we mentioned a commodity agreement in this
                            country, there would have been an explosion. If the IRB had passed it
                            could have been reported as a compromise. But not with 90 of the
                            potential beneficiaries abstaining. I think they have got to understand
                            this. As far as the development process is concerned, I am personally in
                            favor of <persName corresp="#p_GdEV1">Giscard</persName>'s scheme. The
                            thing is, they float the idea but don't follow up on it. So I would
                            appreciate if you could talk to others, for example, Houphuet-Boigny, to
                            support it and to see how it can be developed.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Another point. The OAU is coming up soon. Then the non-aligned
                            summit will take place in Sri Lanka. If we are to make a move on the
                            question of Israeli suspension, now is the time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: If Rabin has one more press conference [referring to Rabin's
                            statement regarding Syrians killing Palestinians], I will join them.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Anyway, we will have to go all out now with the Africans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: My problem is I don't want to ask them to pay us on matters of
                            importance to Israel rather than our own foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LSW1">Lewis</persName>: We should stress the
                            effect Israeli expulsion would have on the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> as an institution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Why don't you tell them about the kind of consequences it is
                            bound to have in the United States during our election and its
                            significance for the UN?</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Now about Namibia, what do you have planned? </p>
                        <p>Secretary: Where's the paper on it?</p>
                        <p>Scranton: On Puerto Rico, I find the picture different than others. More
                            and more I am concerned about the Puerto Rico thing in an election year.
                            It could be dynamite. Maybe the President could say something when he
                            goes to Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: What is happening?</p>
                        <p>Scranton: Well, they are getting hot on the subject in the United
                            Nations. For example, in Algiers they called for independence in Puerto
                            Rico.</p>
                        <p>Lewis: If the Committee of 24 endorses the matter, it could come up in
                            the General Assembly this fall.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: It could be one of the hottest political issues we have. If the
                            President goes to Puerto Rico, can we say something about it?</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We will have to be brutal if it comes to the United Nations.
                            It would be outrageous. On this basis, we can raise the Ukraine and
                            Byelorussia.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: I bring it to you, because I feel it is a Presidential
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Lewis: What if the President were to reaffirm publicly what Eisenhower
                            said in the 50s: that if the Puerto Rican people ever were to vote in
                            favor of independence he would recommend it to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We have to tell the United Nations plainly that it will have
                            the most grievous consequence for our position. Legally, its status is
                            no different than Hawaii. They could then ask for Hawaiian independence
                            and self-determination. But we should tell the non-aligned that we would
                            consider it an unfriendly act and as interference in our domestic
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Scranton: I want to go beyond that to something which would be a plus for
                            the campaign. A strong statement issued after the primaries but before
                            the convention about outrageous interference in Puerto Rico would be a
                            terrific asset in the campaign.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I strongly favor it. I would write a letter to each one of the
                            non-aligned, pointing out what is on the agenda and that supporting
                            discussion of Puerto Rico would be an unfriendly act.</p>
                        <p>Lewis: Maybe we could have a letter to the non-aligned in July after the
                            President's statement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: (Nodded his assent).</p>
                        <p>(The Secretary subsequently told Lewis that he did not want the President
                            to issue a statement on <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>
                            participation in the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>. He said he
                            would have no objection to the statement being issued by our ILO
                            delegation.)</p>

                        <p>I. PURPOSE</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SWW2">Scranton</persName> wishes to report
                            to you on his recent trip to Africa and his upcoming trip to Europe. He
                            will also wish to discuss our position on the Uganda Rescue Mission at
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the continuing issues of
                            Korea, Puerto Rico and Panama.</p>
                        <p>II. BACKGROUND, PARTICIPANTS &amp; PRESS ARRANGEMENTS</p>
                        <p>A. Background: Governor Scranton has just returned from Africa where he
                            visited 11 countries: Sierra Leone, Senegal, Upper Volta, Gabon,
                            Tanzania, Mozambique, Swaziland, Botswana, Zambia, Cameroon and the
                            Ivory Coast. With the notable exception of Mozambique, he met with key
                            leaders to discuss your African policy and important UN issues. He was
                            generally very well received, and found a sympathetic hearing among
                            friendly and moderate non-aligned nations for his exposition of your
                            African policy and his request that the nations of Africa take a
                            moderate position on three issues of particular sensitivity to the
                            United States at the UN: Korea, Puerto Rico and Panama.</p>
                        <p>On the Korea issue, we understand Governor Scranton returned from Africa
                            with several ideas on how this matter can best be handled in the United
                            Nations this year. The State Department believes the best strategy is a
                            simple reiteration of our proposal last year for a meeting of the
                            parties concerned to work out arrangements for continuation of the
                            armistice after termination of the UN Command. This could also include a
                            call for a North-South meeting. You may wish to indicate to Scranton
                            that the important task will be to line up support for a friendly
                            resolution if there is another hostile resolution. We would of course
                            carefully consider any new ideas the Governor may have.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Panama, Scranton may suggest that it would be useful if the
                            negotiators could be in Panama at the time of Torrijos' attendance at
                            the Non-Aligned Conference in order to indicate continuing momentum in
                            the negotiations. The coincidence of timing with the Republican
                            Convention, however, make a visit of the negotiators highly undesirable.
                            No firm dates for another round of treaty talks has yet been set.</p>
                        <p>On the Puerto Rico issue Scranton will want to talk briefly about his
                            efforts during his African trip and in Europe later this month to build
                            support for our efforts to squash the Cuban attempt to raise Puerto Rico
                            at both the Colombo Non-Aligned Conference and the United Nations
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Governor Scranton may also raise the matter of the Security Council
                            meeting on the Israeli Rescue Mission in Uganda, which is now scheduled
                            to convene on Friday, July 9. The U.S. delegation has developed a draft
                            resolution which condemns international acts of terrorism directed
                            against air traffic and equally condemns all countries who cooperate
                            with terrorists. Governor Scranton will also wish to discuss the best
                            course of action should a resolution including a condemnation of Israel
                            be supported by a majority of the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Governor wishes to discuss his upcoming trip to Europe,
                            tentatively scheduled for July 14 to July 23. His general purpose will
                            be to make clear the U.S. position on UN issues of special concern to
                            us, particularly Korea and Puerto Rico, and to share with European
                            leaders impressions from his African trip. Specifically, he plans to
                            visit The Hague for talks on <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss>-UN
                            cooperation, visit NATO in Brussels, attend the <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> Conference in Geneva, and visit
                            Belgrade for talks on the upcoming Non-Aligned Conference in
                            Colombo.</p>
                        <p>B. Participants: Ambassador Scranton and <persName corresp="#p_SB3">Brent
                                Scowcroft</persName>.</p>
                        <p>C. Press Plan: White House Photographer only.</p>
                        <p>III. TALKING POINTS</p>
                        <p>1. Africa: I understand you were well received in Africa. I am anxious to
                            hear your impressions from your trip.</p>
                        <p>2. Korea: The other side's strategy on the Korean issue is not yet clear.
                            Do you assume that they will present a resolution similar to last
                            year's?</p>
                        <p>--The chances for an agreement or a compromise seem very slight. I do not
                            believe that either the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> or the
                            Soviet Union has sufficient leverage to wring any serious concession
                            from Pyong Yang.</p>
                        <p>--At this point we don't expect to make any major change in our strategy.
                            We will of course welcome any new ideas that you may have.</p>
                        <p>3. Puerto Rico: I agree absolutely that we must do everything in our
                            power to prevent the Cubans from raising the issue of Puerto Rico at the
                            General Assembly. As you know, there is absolutely no legal basis for
                            any challenge to Puerto Rico's status. I hope my statement in Puerto
                            Rico last month made clear to all UN members how strongly I feel on this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>4. Israeli Rescue Mission: I certainly hope we can avoid any UN
                            condemnation of Israel for the rescue mission in Uganda. I don't see how
                            we could avoid having to veto any Security Council resolution which
                            contains such a condemnation.</p>
                        <p>5. European Trip: I hear you will be off in a few days to visit Europe. I
                            would like to hear about your plans.</p>

                            NATIONS </p>

                            initialed]</p>
                        <p>I. PURPOSE </p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SWW2">Scranton</persName> wishes to
                            discuss key issues facing us at the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>II. BACKGROUND, PARTICIPANTS &amp; PRESS ARRANGEMENTS </p>
                        <p>A. Background: Governor Scranton will raise several problem areas
                            expected to come before the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> this
                            fall: Puerto Rico, Korea, Namibia, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Membership for Vietnam and Angola.</p>
                        <p>Puerto Rico: Cuba will once again press for a resolution promoting Puerto
                            Rican independence when the Committee of 24 meets at the beginning of
                            September. Our tactic is to persuade members of the Committee to vote to
                            adjourn without adopting a resolution on Puerto Rico; this was
                            successful last year, when the vote was 11-9 for adjournment. It appears
                            we can count on much the same support again, but the outcome is by no
                            means certain. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> has sent personal letters to key countries and
                            our Ambassadors have made demarches to others explaining our position in
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>Korea: Both North and South Korea have placed resolutions on the calendar
                            for the upcoming General Assembly. The hostile resolution, calling for
                            an end to "foreign military involvement and aggression" and the
                            dissolution of the U.N. Command, has 31 co-sponsors; the friendly
                            resolution, urging continued North-South dialogue, has 19.</p>
                        <p>We have formed a Core Group of South Korean supporters to develop
                            strategy and to gain additional co-sponsors for the friendly resolution.
                            Meanwhile, North Korea has been conducting an extensive diplomatic
                            campaign, most recently at the Colombo Non-Aligned Summit, to win
                            support for its position. The North Korean action in the DMZ--both the
                            murder of the American officers and the comparatively soft line later
                            adopted by the North Koreans--probably reflect a North Korean strategy
                            to characterize the US presence as aggressive and destabilizing.</p>
                        <p>Our tactical objective at this session is to urge the General (steering)
                            Committee to defer the entire Korean question.</p>
                        <p>Namibia: The Security Council will hold a one-day session on Namibia
                            August 31, the deadline set by the Security Council last January for
                            free elections leading to independence for the Territory. There will be
                            a more extensive discussion in mid-September.</p>
                        <p>Our strategy during the interim will be to allow the significant results
                            of our recent diplomatic initiatives to become known. If the minimum
                            requirements for Namibia are satisfied (U.N. supervision of the
                            electoral process and participation of all political groups and parties,
                            including <gloss target="#t_SWAPO1">SWAPO</gloss>), the debate should be
                            manageable. If not, the Africans will urge the Security Council to
                            impose mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Section VII of the
                            Charter, and may turn to a "Uniting for Peace" resolution in the General
                            Assembly if we block a Security Council resolution.</p>
                        <p>U.N. Membership for Vietnam and Angola: Vietnam has already applied for
                            membership, and the application will probably be taken up by the
                            Security Council this week. As I indicated earlier, Ambassador Scranton
                            will probably recommend a Presidential statement linking a veto to the
                                <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss> accounting. All other Security
                            Council members are expected to vote in favor of membership for
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Angola has not yet re-applied for membership but we expect them to do so,
                            under Tanzanian sponsorship. The African governments will press us very
                            hard not to repeat our veto of Angolan membership, and could cause
                            trouble for us on Korea and Middle East issues if we disregard their
                            entreaties. Ambassador Scranton can be expected to argue forcefully
                            against a veto of both Vietnam and Angola because of the impact on these
                            other issues.</p>
                        <p>B. Participants: Ambassador Scranton, Secretary Kissinger and Brent
                            Scowcroft.</p>

                        <p>III. TALKING POINTS </p>
                        <p>1. Puerto Rico:</p>
                        <p>--What is your estimate of the voting?</p>
                        <p>2. Korea:</p>
                        <p>--How do you think the events in the DMZ have affected the North Korean
                            case?</p>
                        <p>--Are there any further initiatives open to us to support the South Korea
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>3. Namibia:</p>
                        <p>-- Obviously, the results of the <persName corresp="#p_RWD1"
                                >Rogers</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_SWEJ1">Schaufele</persName>
                            trip will be crucial in determining what our position on Namibia will be
                            in the Council.</p>
                        <p>4. Angola-Vietnam</p>
                        <p>--What is your view on how the Vietnam and Angola membership applications
                            should be handled?</p>

                            21. THIS MESSAGE OUTLINES US OBJECTIVES AT SESSION, SUMMARIZES ISSUES OF

                            REPRESENTATIONS AND REPORTS ON THEM.</p>
                        <p>2. UNGA CONVENES WITHIN MONTH OF END OF NON-ALIGNED SUMMIT. WE LOBBIED
                            BEFORE SUMMIT PRIMARILY TO INFLUENCE OUTCOME AT UNGA ON ISSUES OF KEY
                            IMPORTANCE TO US. ALTHOUGH MANY NON-ALIGNED STATES SOUGHT MODERATE AND
                            CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES,
                            EXTREME POSITIONS USUALLY PREVAILED AND RHETORIC WAS ABOUT AS
                            CONFRONTATIONAL AS EVER. ACCORDINGLY, WE MUST ANTICIPATE VIGOROUS
                            EFFORTS TO INTRODUCE CONTENTIOUS FORMULATIONS OF COLOMBO INTO 31ST
                            UNGA.</p>
                        <p>3. AT 31ST UNGA, THORNY ISSUES OF SOUTHERN AFRICA LIKELY BE MAJOR
                            PREOCCUPATION, AND ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THEM WILL DEPEND IN LARGE PART
                            UPON OUTCOME OF CURRENT US EFFORTS RESOLVE THEM. PRESSURES, RIVALRIES
                            AND FRUSTRATIONS STEMMING FROM MIDDLE EAST SITUATION, INCLUDING LEBANESE
                            TRAGEDY, WILL CONTINUE AND RADICAL <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S

                            SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION IN 1975. AT SAME TIME THERE ARE FAVORABLE
                            ELEMENTS: ASSEMBLY WILL TAKE PLACE AGAINST BACKGROUND OF SEVERAL YEARS
                            OF SUSTAINED US LEADERSHIP ON GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS;
                            AND OUR STRENGTHENED EFFORT TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES
                            THROUGHOUT YEAR IS GRADUALLY MAKING IMPACT.</p>

                        <p>(B) IN HANDLING OF SENSITIVE AREAS OF DISPUTE, ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN
                            AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, KOREA AND CYPRUS, TO ENCOURAGE GENUINE NEGOTIATIONS
                            IF THESE ARE POSSIBLE, BUT IF NOT, TO PRESERVE FRAMEWORKS AND OPTIONS
                            FOR NEGOTIATION AT LATER TIME;</p>

                        <p>(A) SOUTHERN AFRICA. DEPENDING UPON OUTCOME OF CURRENT EFFORTS TO RESOLVE
                            RHODESIAN AND NAMIBIAN ISSUES, MOST ACRIMONIOUS DEBATES IN 31ST UNGA
                            COULD CONCERN THESE KEY SOUTHERN AFRICAN ISSUES. WE CONTINUE TO HOPE,
                            HOWEVER, THAT INITIATIVES UNDERWAY WILL BE PRODUCTIVE. REGARDLESS OF
                            THEIR OUTCOME, WE CAN EXPECT SOUTH AFRICA TO BE STRONGLY CONDEMNED FOR
                            ITS REPRESSIVE DOMESTIC POLICIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPRESS OUR
                            ABHORRENCE OF APARTHEID. </p>

                            AFRICANS SOLVE DIFFICULT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FACING THEM
                            WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>-- WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO ASSIST IN PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF NAMIBIAN AND
                            RHODESIAN PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>-- WE HOPE CURRENT EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT DIVISIVE UNGA
                            DEBATES ON THESE ISSUES WILL BE AVOIDED IN FORTHCOMING SESSION.</p>
                        <p>(B) ZIONISM/RACISM. ZIONISM/RACISM ISSUE WAS RAISED AT LAST <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> IN CONNECTION WITH DEBATE ON DECADE FOR
                            ACTION TO COMBAT RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. DESPITE STRONG US
                            OBJECTIONS, GA ADOPTED RESOLUTION 3379, WHICH SAID ZIONISM IS FORM OF
                            RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND HENCE, COULD BE ADDRESSED IN
                            PROGRAM FOR DECADE. AS RESULT, US ANNOUNCED DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE
                            IN PROGRAM OR IN THE DISCUSSION OF DECADE. GA RESOLUTION WAS RE-ENDORSED
                            BY COLOMBO SUMMIT ALTHOUGH FOUR STATES (ARGENTINA, C.A.R., IVORY COAST,
                            AND PANAMA) ENTERED RESERVATIONS WHICH POSTS, AS APPROPRIATE, MAY NOTE
                            AS HELPFUL IN INDICATING OBJECTION TO REITERATION OF THE GA
                            FORMULATION.</p>
                        <p>TALKING POINTS.</p>
                        <p>-- US WISHES TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAM FOR DECADE, BUT NOT IF IT INCLUDES
                            REFERENCE TO ZIONISM AS FORM OF RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.</p>
                        <p>-- WE ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO MAKE A SIMILAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTENTIOUS
                            RESOLUTION AND CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM FOR DECADE.</p>
                        <p>-- WE BELIEVE PROVISIONS FOR DECADE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THOSE FORMS OF
                            RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION DEFINED BY A CONSENSUS SIMILAR TO THAT
                            WHICH LAUNCHED THE DECADE DURING 28TH UNGA. THIS WOULD NOT INCLUDE
                            ZIONISM.</p>
                        <p>(C) CYPRUS. CYPRUS DEBATE THIS FALL WILL PROBABLY FOLLOW PATTERN OF LAST
                            TWO YEARS IN WHICH THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT PROCEDURAL QUESTION AS WELL AS
                            SUBSTANTIVE RESOLUTION. PROCEDURAL QUESTION WILL CONSIDER WHETHER DEBATE
                            SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN ONE OF GA'S MAIN COMMITTEES, WHERE TURKISH CYPRIOTS
                            COULD BE HEARD, OR IN PLENARY WHERE ORDINARILY THEY WOULD NOT BE HEARD.
                            PRECEDENT WAS SET IN 1974 WHEN CYPRUS DEBATE WAS HELD IN PLENARY RATHER
                            THAN COMMITTEE, ALTHOUGH A COMPROMISE WAS WORKED OUT WHEREBY THE PLENARY
                            DEBATE WAS TRANSFERRED TO COMMITTEE FOR SEVERAL SESSIONS TO PERMIT TURK
                            CYPRIOTS TO PARTICIPATE. TURKS NOW ARE MOUNTING A MAJOR EFFORT TO ASSIGN
                            ENTIRE ITEM TO THE SPECIAL POLITICAL COMMITTEE. ON SUBSTANTIVE SIDE, THE
                            GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS PROBABLY AGAIN WILL INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION CALLING
                            FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN MILITARY FORCES ON
                            THE ISLAND.</p>

                            DECLARING INDIAN OCEAN TO BE QUOTE ZONE OF PEACE UNQUOTE. IN 1972 IT

                            ADOPTED BY GA. SUCH PROPOSALS CONTRADICT PURPOSE OF BIENNIAL BUDGET.</p>
                        <p>TALKING POINTS.</p>
                        <p>-- WE BELIEVE THAT ESSENTIAL COSTS AND PROGRAMS FOR WHICH APPROVED BUDGET
                            MAKES NO PROVISION SHOULD BE FUNDED FROM SAVINGS AND ECONOMIES WITHIN

                            TO REPORT COMPLETE SET OF ACTION PROPOSALS TO THE 31ST GA. EXPECTED
                            CONTINUATION OF AD HOC COMMITTEE'S MANDATE WOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO

                        <p>(M) EXTERNAL EVALUATION MECHANISM. US ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO

                            OF KOREA, WHICH FOR REASONS OF BOTH HISTORICAL INVOLVEMENT AND RECENT
                            EVENTS IS OF DEEP CONCERN TO THE UNITED STATES, IN WORDS WHICH WERE SO
                            TENDENTIOUS AND ONE-SIDED AS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE TO A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER
                            OF PARTICIPANTS AT COLOMBO WHO ENTERED WRITTEN OR ORAL RESERVATIONS. WE
                            FIND THE ENDORSEMENT OF NORTH KOREA'S COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED CHARGES
                            AGAINST THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY UNSEEMLY, COMING AS IT DID
                            IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE BRUTAL MURDER OF TWO U.S. OFFICERS OF THE UN
                            COMMAND IN THE JOINT SECURITY AREA OF THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE IN KOREA BY
                            NORTH KOREAN ARMY PERSONNEL. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COUNTRY WHICH
                            SUPPORTS THE HIGHLY PARTISAN LANGUAGE ON KOREA CONTAINED IN THE
                            DECLARATION AND EVEN MORE SO IN THE SEPARATE RESOLUTION ON KOREA CAN BE

                            WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO AVOID ANOTHER STERILE CONFRONTATION IN UNGA, WE
                            WERE FORCED TO MEET THE CHALLENGE POSED BY THE ONE-SIDED PRO-NORTH
                            KOREAN RESOLUTION INTRODUCED ON AUGUST 16 AND, THUS, SUBMITTED
                            RESOLUTION ON AUGUST 20. OUR RESOLUTION CALLS FOR NORTH/SOUTH TALKS AND
                            FOUR PARTY (U.S., <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, SOUTH AND NORTH

                            PEACE. IN CONTRAST TO NORTH KOREAN POSITION WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE ROK FROM
                            DISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES, PRO-ROK RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THAT BOTH
                            SOUTH AND NORTH OF KOREA MUST PARTICIPATE IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS.</p>
                        <p>E. TALKING POINTS:</p>
                        <p>--PRO-NORTH KOREA RESOLUTION IS BASED ON PROPAGANDISTIC AUGUST 5
                            STATEMENT BY NK ACCUSING U.S. OF AGGRESSIVE DESIGNS IN KOREA. IT IGNORES
                            FACTS THAT WE AND ROK HAVE INVITED PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED TO DISCUSS
                            EASING OF TENSIONS AND THAT 30TH <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            PASSED RESOLUTION EMBODYING THIS PROPOSAL. THIS INVITATION SO FAR HAS
                            BEEN IGNORED BY NORTH KOREA AND ITS SUPPORTERS.</p>
                        <p>--PRO-NORTH KOREA RESOLUTION INDICATES NORTH'S CLEAR INTENTION TO FORCE
                            CONTENTIOUS AND UNPRODUCTIVE DEBATE ON KOREA. IT SEEMS DESIGNED TO
                            OBSCURE NORTH'S REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE ROK ON FUTURE OF PENINSULA
                            AND ITS FAILURE TO RESUME DIALOGUE WITH ROK WHICH BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO
                            IN 1972 AND WHICH ROK IS WILLING TO RESUME WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS.</p>
                        <p>--PRO-NORTH KOREA RESOLUTION IGNORES ROK WHICH GOVERNS TWO-THIRDS OF
                            KOREAN PEOPLE, IS RECOGNIZED BY OVER 90 STATES AND IS A MEMBER OF
                            VIRTUALLY EVERY SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION (EXCEPT UN
                            ITSELF).</p>
                        <p>--WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE SUREST WAY TO PROGRESS ON KOREAN QUESTION IS
                            THROUGH NORTH/SOUTH TALKS AND THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS ON EASING TENSIONS
                            SUCH AS THOSE PROPOSED BY THE SECRETARY IN HIS JULY 22 SPEECH RATHER
                            THAT BY CONFRONTATION AS CONTAINED IN NORTH KOREAN APPROACH.</p>
                        <p>--OUR APPROACH STRESSES NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE ARMISTICE AGREEMENT
                            OR SOME ALTERNATIVE WHILE BEING WILLING TO TERMINATE UN COMMAND. IT ALSO
                            DEMONSTRATES U.S.-ROK READINESS TO DISCUSS REPLACEMENT OF ARMISTICE WITH
                            MORE PERMANENT ALTERNATIVE. IT RECOGNIZES THAT ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                            MUST PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS AFFECTING SECURITY OF PENINSULA.</p>
                        <p>--U.S. TROOPS IN KOREA ARE PRESENT ON BASIS OF BILATERAL MUTUAL SECURITY
                            AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ROK. (NORTH KOREA HAS SECURITY AGREEMENTS

                            PENINSULA WERE HIGHLIGHTED BY RECENT MURDER IN THE JOINT SECURITY AREA

                            UNITED NATIONS AS IF IT WERE A COLONIAL ISSUE. WE CONSIDER ANY SUCH
                            DECLARATION AS INTERFERENCE IN U.S. DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. SINCE THE

                            SELF-DETERMINATION, THERE ARE NO LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DISCUSSION OR ACTION

                            THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE) SET UP AT 30TH GA.
                            ALMOST CERTAINLY, THERE WILL BE A RESOLUTION ENDORSING REPORT'S
                            RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE CALL FOR TOTAL ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM
                            OCCUPIED TERRITORIES BY JUNE 1, 1977 AND TWO-STAGE RETURN OF PALESTINIAN
                            ARAB REFUGEES TO THEIR HOMES IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND IN ISRAEL. WE
                            HAVE OPPOSED THIS COMMITTEE FROM ITS INCEPTION BECAUSE OF ITS ONE-SIDED
                            TERMS OF REFERENCE AND TOTALLY UNREPRESENTATIVE COMPOSITION. THERE WILL
                            ALSO BE DEBATE ON ISRAELI PRACTICES IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, INCLUDING
                            QUESTION OF JEWISH SETTLEMENTS AND ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF RELIGIOUS
                            RIGHTS. WHETHER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT IS DEBATED SEPARATELY FROM THE
                            PALESTINIAN ISSUE OR DEFERRED DEPENDS ON SITUATION IN MIDDLE EAST AND
                            INTER-ARAB RIVALRIES. REGARDING LEBANON, THERE IS NO MOVE AT THE MOMENT
                            TO INSCRIBE IT ON THE AGENDA, AND WE SEE NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY
                            BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO THE GA, EXCEPT PERHAPS ITS HUMANITARIAN
                            ASPECTS.</p>

                        <p>BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION AFFAIRS </p>
                        <p>Overall Setting and Trends</p>
                        <p>Several years ago we faced throughout the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> system paradoxical situation with two broad
                            dimensions:</p>
                        <p>--Greater need for effective international organizations to handle
                            problems of world interdependence in a rapidly expanding number of
                            areas--the oceans, development, technology, food, energy and many
                            others.</p>
                        <p>--Greater difficulty in making international organizations function
                            cooperatively and productively; growing isolation of the US; increasing
                            use of bloc tactics by the Third World; heightening stridency of attacks
                            upon the US and its friends; and eroding support by the American public
                            and Congress.</p>
                        <p>There were many reasons for these difficulties:</p>
                        <p>--Partly historical circumstances: the explosion in UN membership from 51
                            to nearly 150 members, most poor and weak--with different traditions and
                            interests from the original predominantly Western membership and feeling
                            a need to band together to maximize their leverage in all possible ways
                            to reshape a system they did not participate in creating.</p>
                        <p>--Partly the inherent difficulties in doing serious business in any large
                            public forum. These are unavoidably conducive to: posturing;
                            competitions for leadership through advocacy of extreme positions; and
                            utilization of voting to maximize the appearance of "victories".</p>
                        <p>--But mainly deep frustration and impatience by many UN members over the
                            slow progress, in and out of the UN, regarding three large clusters of
                            substantive issues: the Arab-Israeli problem; achieving racial justice
                            and self-rule in Southern Africa; and establishing a more equitable
                            international economic system to narrow the enormous gap in prosperity
                            between industrialized and developing nations.</p>
                        <p>With the structure of post-war international organizations threatened, it
                            was essential to make new efforts to reverse the deterioration and to
                            increase the opportunities for practical cooperation to serve US
                            interests. Our response has consisted of these elements:</p>
                        <p>--Of most importance, it seemed essential for the US, still the world's
                            strongest and most influential country, to introduce new elements of
                            substantive leadership demonstrating an understanding for and interest
                            in the concerns of the Third World and focusing attention on practical
                            proposals for economic cooperation. This approach was reflected in our
                            submission at the 7th Special Session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> of comprehensive proposals to advance common interests
                            of both the industrial and developing countries. This approach--of
                            concentrating on substantive issues--has been-directly complemented by
                            initiatives taken outside UN bodies, like US encouragement of faster
                            progress toward majority rule in Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>--There was also clearly a need for more effective marshalling of US
                            diplomatic resources, bilateral as well as multilateral, to develop a
                            more meaningful dialogue on the merits of issues and to impress on
                            others that confrontational bloc tactics (particularly after we had
                            begun to respond sympathetically to Third World concerns) could
                            jeopardize essential US support for UN bodies.</p>
                        <p>--With our allies we intensified efforts to concert and develop common
                            positions to reinforce our positive initiatives and to minimize the
                            ability of extremists to isolate us.</p>
                        <p>--And finally we adopted a more assertive style of diplomacy to defend
                            ourselves against unwarranted attacks and to advance fundamental
                            propositions on such basic UN issues as human rights, development, and
                            the need for fair international procedures.</p>
                        <p>Recent trends indicate that the sharp deterioration of several years ago
                            has been reversed:</p>
                        <p>--US initiatives at the 7th Special Session and subsequently have
                            resulted overall in some greater readiness of developing countries to
                            work with us to find common interests and to pursue practical steps.</p>
                        <p>--There has been a strengthening of moderate Third World leadership and
                            the extremists no longer have a total grip on Third World participation
                            in international organizations.</p>
                        <p>--Current major meetings like the present UNGA and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> General Conference have been much
                            less dominated by confrontation than prior meetings. Cooperation between
                            Western and African countries has been especially noteworthy.</p>
                        <p>--The Security Council, the paramount UN body for us, has conducted its
                            business, overall, in a serious and responsible manner even though we
                            have found it necessary on occasion to use our veto power.</p>
                        <p>However, despite the considerable recent progress, problems and
                            uncertainties lie ahead:</p>
                        <p>--The greater spirit of accommodation within UN bodies is still fragile
                            and will not last through 1977 unless there is continuing substantial
                            progress, in and out of the UN, regarding the major areas--the Middle
                            East, Southern Africa, and North-South economic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>--A direct interconnection exists between progress on Middle East and
                            African problems, and our overall difficulties in the UN. If, for
                            example, there is significant progress on Southern African issues, then
                            we should retain the growing good will of the Africans, the largest
                            single group of UN votes, and it will be correspondingly harder for the
                            Arabs to muster African support for hostile moves against Israel. Over
                            the years our greatest difficulties have occurred when both major groups
                            of voting strength, African and Arab, are arrayed against us in mutual
                            support of each other.</p>
                        <p>--While East-West problems have not recently dominated the UN, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to play a spoiling role in
                            our efforts to improve cooperation with the developing countries.</p>
                        <p>--Serious question exists about our continued participation in two major
                            UN agencies, <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> and UNESCO, thus
                            raising broader issues about our influence in important UN
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>--The UN's financial and management problems remain severe. They burden
                            substantive programs and they understandably undermine essential support
                            from Congress.</p>
                        <p>Major Issues of Significance to US Interests</p>
                        <p>1. The Middle East. In the absence of negotiating progress, the Arab
                            states will continue to use the entire spectrum of UN bodies as
                            platforms to dramatize their cause and to pressure Israel. While it is
                            impossible to predict the specific forums where Arab initiatives will be
                            taken next year, a major focus could be Security Council meetings to
                            renew the UN peacekeeping force mandate in the Golan Heights May 30
                            (assuming a six-month renewal November 30). Should Syria threaten
                            non-renewal to try to accelerate negotiations on Arab-Israeli issues,
                            this could create difficulties, particularly for the Israelis in their
                            election period.</p>
                        <p>2. Southern Africa. Consideration of Southern Africa will continue to
                            preoccupy the UN as it has during the past year. Regarding Rhodesia,
                            progress in the Geneva talks could buy some time on that issue.
                            Regarding Namibia, a Security Council meeting is likely by early next
                            year. The timing and substance will depend on progress of the
                            negotiations involving South Africa and <gloss target="#t_SWAPO1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss>. Regarding apartheid, there will be spillover into
                            1977 of pressures the Africans have been exerting in the Security
                            Council and the UNGA. Recurrence of rioting will likely trigger new
                            requests for a mandatory arms embargo and/or economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>3. The North-South Relationship. We will need to consider in early 1977
                            our basic strategy for dealing with the next stage of North-South
                            issues. Discussions both inside and outside the UN have reached a
                            critical phase. The <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> will begin
                            consideration of an <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> proposal for a
                            common fund for commodities which we have not favored. And the future
                            existence of the <gloss target="#t_CIEC1">CIEC</gloss> will be at issue.
                            At the current UNGA, it is possible that LDCs will call for another
                            special session during the early months of 1977, or conceivably an
                            extension of the present one, to give new direction to North-South
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>4. US Membership in UNESCO. We must consider early in 1977 whether we
                            will be justified in seeking a resumption of our financial support. We
                            now expect that the current Nairobi meeting will rectify one of the two
                            problems which led to the Congressional cutoff--permitting Israel to
                            join the European regional group. However, we do not expect UNESCO to
                            rescind the measures it took against Israel because of its archeological
                            digs in Jerusalem. A favorable development, though it was not an issue
                            involved in the earlier Congressional cutoff, is that UNESCO has not
                            supported a Soviet-backed declaration designed to limit freedom of the
                            mass media. The question in January will be whether there has been
                            sufficient progress to justify a Presidential request to Congress to
                            restore US funding (our arrearages will then be $67 million) when some
                            of Israel's supporters will still be highly dissatisfied. On the other
                            hand, the strong cooperation we have had from many Africans and the
                            UNESCO Secretariat may not last if we continue to deny crucial US
                            financial support.</p>
                        <p>5. The US and the ILO. The US must decide next year whether to continue
                            being a member or withdraw at the end of the two-year period specified
                            in our letter of intent (November 6, 1977). We have stated we would work
                            within this two-year period to help the ILO return to its basic
                            principles and to try to eliminate excessive politicization so that we
                            could continue our membership. We have made some headway in recent ILO
                            meetings. A Cabinet-level Committee under the Secretary of Labor is
                            monitoring progress. A major target for our efforts will be the June
                            1977 meeting of the ILO General Conference. Planning for this effort
                            should begin in early 1977.</p>
                        <p>6. Human Rights. We will need early in the year to determine our approach
                            to the annual meeting of the UN's Human Rights Commission
                            (February-March). We have been fighting an uphill battle in an effort to
                            make the commission's special procedures on complaints regarding serious
                            human rights violations objective and effective. The meeting will
                            consider new charges concerning five developing countries, but we can
                            expect the traditional efforts of the USSR and some Third World
                            countries to render the procedures ineffective and to keep the focus on
                            selected complaints against Chile, South Africa, and Israel, while human
                            rights violations elsewhere are ignored.</p>
                        <p>7. Arms Control and Disarmament. We should determine early in the year
                            our approach to preparations for a UN special session on disarmament. We
                            expect the current UNGA to decide to hold such a meeting in 1978--with
                            preparatory meetings beginning in the first half of 1977. The special
                            session will probably focus on multilateral arms control issues like
                            nonproliferation and possible approaches to control of conventional
                            armaments--as opposed to such subjects as SALT.</p>
                        <p>8. Financial and Managerial Problems. The UN's financial and managerial
                            difficulties continue to mount:</p>
                        <p>--During the current UNGA, Arab delegations are working hard to try to
                            defeat adoption of a new scale of assessments which would considerably
                            increase the annual percentage share due from the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> states. If this happens, a strong
                            adverse public and Congressional reaction can be expected and would
                            further undermine overall domestic support for the UN.</p>
                        <p>--Regarding UN structural problems, we will have to review our approach
                            to a broad project now underway--improving the functioning of the
                            economic and social side of the UN (which utilizes over 90% of the UN's
                            resources). The present UN committee's effort has stalled and
                            revitalization might only be possible as a result of US initiative.</p>
                        <p>-- Early next year, Senator <persName corresp="#p_RAA3"
                                >Ribicoff</persName>'s Government Operations Committee plans to hold
                            extensive hearings on US participation in international organizations,
                            especially UN specialized agencies. It will consider how US interests
                            are served by various organizations; how the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> influences, monitors, and evaluates their work; and how
                            various parts of the executive branch coordinate in determining and
                            advancing US objectives.</p>
                        <p>9. Election of a New UN Secretary General. It remains highly likely that
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName> will be
                            re-elected for a second five-year term. There exists an outside chance,
                            however, that, if a candidate with strong Third World support is put
                            forward, Waldheim may not be elected. In the unlikely event a Third
                            World candidate becomes Secretary General, there could well be
                            significant new challenges to the management of our diplomacy at the UN
                            and, in particular, for the US representatives at the UN, since much of
                            our influence in that organization has often peen exerted through a
                            strong working relationship between the US representatives and the
                            Secretary General.</p>
                        <p>10. UN Membership. Vietnam will press the new Administration for an early
                            reversal of prior US vetoes of its application. Although the final
                            decision on new members normally cannot be taken before the next UNGA
                            (fall 1977), the Vietnamese are likely to press for the key Security
                            Council recommendation as early as possible.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: The Third World</p>
                        <p>The topic of "The Third World" was not on anybody's list of transition
                            papers. That indicates what the problem is: nobody has responsibility
                            for it. Bureaucratically it is a "non-problem".</p>
                        <p>Transmitted herewith is our joint attempt to flag the issue which you may
                            wish to include in the package of transition papers currently being
                            processed.</p>

                        <p>THE THIRD WORLD </p>
                        <p>ISSUE:</p>
                        <p>The Third World is a newly emerging phenomenon which does not readily
                            engage our existing bureaucratic structure. Accordingly, we have not yet
                            come to grips with its full implications or really geared up to explore
                            possible responses to its initiatives.</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>A newly emerging and rapidly evolving phenomenon on the international
                            scene, but one whose growing importance for us can be predicted with
                            comparative certainty, is the Third World. The Third World is neither a
                            group of countries nor a series of issues; country and issue alignments
                            shift. At this point it probably would be fair to say that the Third
                            World is a state of mind. But it is a very real state of mind to those
                            who hold it and there are a lot of them.</p>
                        <p>Of increasing importance to the maintenance and growth of this state of
                            mind is the Third World view of the history of the nineteenth and
                            twentieth centuries. The basic theme is the growth of colonialism
                            normally depicted (that is really too strong a word for what is still a
                            vague, ongoing process of historical revision) in more or less classic
                            Marxist terms, i.e. , an inevitable outgrowth of exploitative
                            capitalism. More modern times are seen then as the breakdown of the
                            colonial system under the impetus of local, indigenous liberation
                            movements. After liberation, however, the scars of colonialism remain in
                            the form of underdevelopment, the fault, and therefore the
                            responsibility, of the capitalist-colonialist powers. In many cases the
                            economic relationship continues (neocolonialism) after political
                            independence has been achieved.</p>
                        <p>The theory, obviously, was not launched free-flying from the brow of
                            Marx; it has its contemporaneous nourishing wellsprings also. It would
                            be a serious mistake, however, to regard the phenomenon as nothing more
                            than local reflections of communist bloc propaganda. It has indigenous
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>In discourse, the Third World tends to be difficult for us to understand.
                            Its tone is rhetorical and it has the habit of using in a political
                            context words which, to us, are the language of economics. Thus,
                            "capitalist”, "socialist", "distribution of wealth", "terms of trade",
                            etc. Had we not witnessed it we might have relegated to the world of
                            Lewis Carroll the scene of the underdeveloped world en masse applauding
                            the fourfold increase in petroleum prices initially decreed by <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. It was devastating to their
                            economies, but that was lost, at least initially, under the aura of the
                            underdeveloped world starting to get back its own from the colonialist
                            powers--and paying us back in our own coin of translating economic
                            advantage into political muscle. </p>
                        <p>As indicated above, not all of the countries in the Third World share a
                            common position on all issues. Nevertheless, a body of basic
                            propositions is emerging around which there is a growing consensus.
                            Among the more prominent of these are:</p>
                        <p>--Underdevelopment is the fault of the capitalist-developed world. The
                            cure for underdevelopment, therefore, is the responsibility of that
                            world.</p>
                        <p>--The capitalist-developed world is playing with a stacked deck. The
                            prices of the manufactured goods which the developed world exports, and
                            which the underdeveloped world needs, go up much faster than the prices
                            of the basic raw materials and agricultural products on which the
                            underdeveloped world must rely for its foreign exchange. This is not
                            coincidental but systemic and deliberate.</p>
                        <p>--The international monetary structure likewise is controlled by and
                            rigged in favor of developed countries. The failure of those countries
                            to relieve the increasing strangulation by official debt of the
                            underdeveloped world is deliberate and contrived. (As an indication of
                            the objective situation, official debt service obligations of Latin
                            America as a whole in 1975 equal 65 percent of total official
                            concessional flows--i.e., "development assistance" to those
                            countries.)</p>
                        <p>In order for the underdeveloped world to break its dependence on the
                            exportation, at wildly fluctuating prices, of primary commodities, the
                            Third World says, several things are necessary:</p>
                        <p>--commodity price stabilization arrangements, including stabilization of
                            demand (with both price and demand on the high side and rising);</p>
                        <p>--increased investment in manufacturing with uninhibited access of their
                            manufactured products to the markets of the developed world;</p>
                        <p>--debt rescheduling on generous terms and covering all manner of debt,
                            short to long term, private and official. Some ideologues are demanding
                            a complete restructuring of international credit mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>--transfer of technology. (Our rhetoric comes back to haunt us. We have
                            long sung our technological superiority as a predominant basis for our
                            high standard of living and international power. The Third World doesn't
                            quite know what it is, but they want some.)</p>
                        <p>Many of the problems that these beliefs and desires present to us--and
                            will present increasingly to us in the future--are obvious. One such
                            problem may not be obvious. In our governmental structure aid, trade,
                            investment, and international financial arrangements are handled by
                            distinct bureaucratic elements (with the normal "consultation and
                            coordination"). Yet, as indicated above, the Third World, increasingly,
                            is coming to see these problems as related and interdependent (which, of
                            course, they are). Under our present organization the foreign policy
                            coordination function is most frequently handled on a geographic basis.
                            But these problems have no geographic focus, or, rather, they have a
                            multi-regional focus. For example, Venezuelan votes in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will be affected not only, and often not
                            even primarily, by its position vis-a-vis other Latin American
                            countries, but also by its role in OPEC and the need to make that role
                            seem "protective" (rather than in derogation) of the interests of
                            non-oil-producing <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. This has
                            produced some odd marriages of convenience on specific issues at
                            specific times.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that Third World economic proposals coalesce sufficiently
                            to be treated seriously, other entities in our government take the lead:
                                <gloss target="#t_EB1">EB</gloss> in State or <gloss
                                target="#t_STR1">STR</gloss> on trade issues or Treasury on
                            financial matters, or Agriculture on questions within its bailiwick.
                            Each of these, however, tends to attempt to address Third World
                            initiatives in the context of broader policies tailored for other
                            situations. The Third World has no "interpreter" within the bureaucracy
                            as do individual countries or regions, to assure that US interests
                            vis-a-vis the Third World are fully costed out alongside our interests
                            in--say--a given policy proposal on textile imports or food exports or
                            US security.</p>
                        <p>In attempting to handle "Third World" issues, be it at the UN, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEC1">CIEC</gloss>, or as such issues impact on OPEC,
                            etc., we do not have a real grip on the constantly shifting dynamics
                            within this amorphous group of countries. Of even more serious import,
                            we do not presently have the analytical focus to formulate our own
                            initiatives in the principal areas of Third World concern. One price of
                            this is that meanwhile, as the present CIEC meeting in Paris
                            demonstrates we move, and badly, to their agenda.</p>

                            IN THE UNGA ON THESE ISSUES WERE FURTHER DEFINED AT <gloss

                        <p>B. POLITICAL ISSUES AT 31ST <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> HAD ALSO
                            BEEN EXTENSIVELY NEGOTIATED AT PRECEDING INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS. AT
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> SUMMIT AND ELSEWHERE, AFRICANS
                            DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY DEFINITELY WOULD NOT NOW SUPPORT ISRAEL'S
                            EXCLUSION FROM GA, AND WERE INCREASINGLY RELUCTANT TO REAFFIRM
                            ZIONISM/RACISM WHEN THIS WOULD REDUCE SUPPORT FOR ACTIONS ON APARTHEID.
                            SIMILARLY, CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LDCS, TO WHOM WE HAD MADE REGULAR
                            REPRESENTATIONS, RECOGNIZED IRRELEVANCE OF KOREA AND PUERTO RICO ISSUES
                            TO THEIR OWN INTERESTS IN THE GA. RESULT, ASSISTED BY INEPTITUDE AND
                            ARROGANCE OF CUBA AND NORTH KOREA AT COLOMBO, WAS THAT THESE TWO ISSUES
                            LOST MUCH SUPPORT AND BOTH COUNTRIES DECIDED NOT TO PUSH THEM AT THE
                            31ST UNGA.</p>
                        <p>3. DYNAMICS OF THE 31ST GA. A. RELATIVE ABSENCE OF POLITICAL STRIFE
                            PROVIDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR VIEW OF USES OR MISUSES OF GA BY ITS MEMBERS
                            AND THEIR PURPOSES IN IT. THUS, 31ST UNGA SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE UNGA'S
                            LDC MAJORITY REGARD IT SERIOUSLY AS A WAY TO BE HEARD EFFECTIVELY, AND
                            TO FURTHER IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, WE SEE TOO MUCH
                            LDC BEHAVIOR AS STILL NOT SERVING THESE SERIOUS PURPOSES. UNGA'S
                            LEGITIMATE FUNCTION AS A SAFETY-VALVE FOR EMOTION AND FRUSTRATION IS
                            GROSSLY OVERUSED TO DISPLAY FERVOR AND SOLIDARITY AND TO PUNISH WITH
                            WORDS.</p>

                            RESOLUTIONS BY BLOC VOTES, AS IN 29TH AND 30TH UNGAS, AND SIXTH SPECIAL
                            SESSION, DID NOT RECUR. ALTHOUGH LDCS ORGANIZED AS THE GROUP OF 77 OFTEN
                            BECAME IMPATIENT WITH PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS ON G-77-SPONSORED
                            RESOLUTIONS OPPOSED BY ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES,
                            G-77 NORMALLY CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS WHEN NECESSARY TO AVOID NUMEROUS
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRY ABSTENTIONS OR NEGATIVE VOTES. UN MEMBERS ALSO
                            INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED THAT CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS (E.G., CONVENING A
                            SPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENT) REQUIRE AS NEARLY UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AS
                            POSSIBLE. DESIRE TO ADOPT SUCH RESOLUTIONS BY CONSENSUS SUSTAINED
                            NEGOTIATIONS ON THEM.</p>
                        <p>C. DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WERE ACTIVE IN THIS GA, FINDING MORE SUCCESS ON
                            THEIR INITIATIVES THAN IN RECENT PAST. THESE TENDED TO AVOID MAIN
                            POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREAS OF CONTENTION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED CONSENSUS
                            ADOPTION OF ITS RESOLUTION ON AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST TAKING
                            OF HOSTAGES. BY CONTRAST, JAPAN HAD TO ABANDON ITS RESOLUTION ON
                            CONVENTIONAL ARMS FOR LACK OF SUPPORT. THESE AND OTHER EXPERIENCES
                            EMPHASIZED VALUE OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' INITIATIVES IN THE UN ON
                            COMPLEX OR SENSITIVE SUBJECTS.</p>
                        <p>4. GROUPS AND CAUCUSES. </p>
                        <p>A. THESE WERE PARTICULARLY ACTIVE THIS YEAR. AMONG DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
                            THE WESTERN EUROPEAN AND OTHERS GROUP (<gloss target="#t_WEO1"
                                >WEO</gloss>) WAS USEFUL FOR EXCHANGING INFORMATION AND COMPARING
                            VIEWS. HOWEVER, SMALLER IMPROVISED GROUPS HANDLED COORDINATION AND
                            NEGOTIATION OF SPECIFIC POSITIONS. OF THESE, KOREA CORE GROUP
                            COORDINATED STRATEGY, AND REPRESENTATIONS IN NEW YORK AND CAPITALS,
                            BETWEEN 30TH AND 31ST UNGAS AND WOULD HAVE HANDLED THE KOREA ISSUE AT
                            THE 31ST GA HAD IT NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss> SHOWED IMPRESSIVE DETERMINATION
                            TO ACHIEVE COORDINATED POSITIONS. THESE EFFORTS AT CO-ORDINATION WERE
                            OFTEN PROTRACTED, PRODUCING INFLEXIBLE AND MINIMAL COMMON POSITIONS. WE
                            THUS FREQUENTLY HAD DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING EC-9 SUPPORT FOR OUR
                            USUALLY MORE DEMANDING POSITIONS, PARTICULARLY ON ECONOMIC ISSUES.
                            HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE NOW HAVE A SOLID BASE FOR INCREASING
                            CONSULTATIONS WITH EC-9 COUNTRIES IN NEW YORK, CAPITALS AND EC-9'S OWN
                            FORUMS ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.</p>
                        <p>C. AMONG LDCS, MOST IMPORTANT FORMAL CAUCUSES WERE REGIONAL GROUPS,
                                <gloss target="#t_NAM1">NAM</gloss>, AND G-77. AFRICAN GROUP WAS
                            PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ITS NUMBERS AND ENERGY WHICH GAVE IT
                            CONTROL OVER ISSUES MOST IMPORTANT TO IT. THE NAM, ENERGIZED BY COLOMBO,
                            WAS EXTREMELY ACTIVE AND SPONSORED RESOLUTIONS WHICH WERE ADOPTED ON
                            WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND DISARMAMENT ISSUES. MANY OF THESE
                            RESOLUTIONS WERE COLOMBO POSITIONS AND WERE MANAGED BY THE COORDINATING
                            COUNTRIES ASSIGNED TO THEM THERE. THE NON-ALIGNED COORDINATING COMMITTEE
                                (<gloss target="#t_NACC1">NACC</gloss>) MET REGULARLY TO CONSIDER
                            PROGRESS REPORTS AND PROVIDE GENERAL GUIDANCE.</p>
                        <p>D. THE G-77 HAD A SEMI-FORMAL COORDINATING STRUCTURE UNDER A COMMITTEE
                            CHAIRED BY PAKISTAN TO WHICH GROUPS COVERING EACH ISSUE AND GA COMMITTEE
                            REPORTED. THE SPECIFICS OF BASICALLY AGREED POSITIONS WERE OFTEN
                            INTENSIVELY NEGOTIATED WITHIN G-77. G-77'S BASIC PURPOSE WAS TO
                            DEMONSTRATE LDC DISSATISFACTION WITH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC NEGOTIATIONS
                            ON KEY ISSUES (DEBT, COMMODITIES), AND TO FURTHER INTERNATIONAL

                            WHICH USSR IS A CO-CHAIRMAN) SHOULD NOW BE REVIVED HELPED THIS EFFORT.
                            HOWEVER, LDCS' RECOGNITION OF SOVIET IRRELEVANCE TO MOST OF THEIR
                            ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES, AND ABSENCE OF A SOVIET ROLE IN POLITICAL ISSUES
                            SUCH AS CYPRUS, ONCE AGAIN KEPT USSR FROM FINDING A PLACE IN THE 31ST

                            RESPONSES TO THESE WERE MIXED. ALTHOUGH G-77 PRESSED SWEEPING DEMANDS
                            AND CRITICIZED ALLEGED LACK OF RESPONSE BY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, TONE OF
                            THE SESSION EVEN ON THESE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WAS RELATIVELY FREE OF
                            RANCOR. IN GENERAL, THERE WAS REASONABLE WEO SOLIDARITY ON THESE ISSUES,
                            BUT IN SEVERAL CASES IT WAS FIRMNESS OF US POSITION THAT HELD WEO
                            WAVERERS IN LINE.</p>
                        <p>IT IS TOO EARLY TO JUDGE THE NET RESULTS OF 31ST UNGA ON NORTH/SOUTH
                            ISSUES. OVERALL, IT PROBABLY DID NOT ADVANCE OR RETARD ONGOING DIALOGUE
                            ON THESE ISSUES, BUT IT DID UNDERSCORE DIFFICULTIES AHEAD. G-77 HAS
                            CLEARLY NOT RELENTED IN ITS DEMANDS, ALTHOUGH SOME MODERATE LEADERS
                            DISLIKED THE EXTREMISM OF OTHER LEADERS SUCH AS PAKISTAN. MOREOVER,
                            DESPITE CRITICISMS IN SOME OF THESE RESOLUTIONS, IMPORTANT G-77
                            COUNTRIES SEEMED WILLING TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEW US ADMINISTRATION CAN
                            INDICATE ITS POSITIONS. ALL OF FOLLOWING ISSUES WILL BE BEFORE VARIOUS
                            FORUMS IN 1977. AMONG THESE MAY WELL BE A RESUMED 31ST UNGA SESSION ON
                            ECONOMIC ISSUES IN LATE SPRING.</p>
                        <p>B. CIEC. THE SECRETARY'S UNGA ADDRESS CALLED FOR RENEWED IMPETUS FOR
                            PARIS CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION (CIEC). G-77 CIEC
                            RESOLUTION BY PAKISTAN SAID MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAD YET TO
                            DEMONSTRATE IN CIEC POLITICAL WILL NECESSARY FOR CONCRETE RESULTS. IT
                            URGED THEM TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO LDC PROPOSALS (THUS IGNORING
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRY PROPOSALS ACTUALLY MADE IN CIEC). AFTER INTENSIVE
                            NEGOTIATIONS FAILED, PAKISTAN'S ORIGINAL DRAFT WAS ADOPTED BY 99-0-30
                            (VIRTUALLY ALL WEO'S PLUS SOVIET BLOC EXCEPT ROMANIA). THE US EMPHASIZED
                            OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING DIALOGUE AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN CIEC,
                            BUT CALLED RESOLUTION ONE-SIDED AND PREJUDICIAL TO CIEC. EC-9, JAPAN,
                            CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER WEOS MADE SIMILAR STATEMENTS. SOVIET BLOC
                            MEMBERS SAID THEY ABSTAINED AS NON-PARTICIPANTS IN CIEC. THE RESOLUTION
                            AND ITS NEGOTIATION WERE UNFORTUNATE, BUT WE WERE GRATIFIED BY WEO
                            SOLIDARITY, EVEN INCLUDING SUCH SOFT-LINERS AS SWEDEN. MOREOVER, A
                            NUMBER OF MORE MODERATE MEMBERS OF THE G-77 WERE DISSATISFIED BY
                            PAKISTAN'S HARD LINE. SINCE CIEC'S MINISTERIAL SESSION WAS LATER
                            POSTPONED (PROBABLY TO NEXT SPRING), THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CIEC
                            RESOLUTION MAY BE MINIMAL.</p>
                        <p>C. NIEO. PAKISTAN'S (G-77) RESOLUTION ON IMPLEMENTING NEW INTERNATIONAL
                            ECONOMIC ORDER (NIEO) WAS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE TO US. IT CLAIMED A
                            6TH SPECIAL SESSION COMMITMENT TO NIEO BY ALL COUNTRIES; CRITICIZED
                            DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' LACK OF POLITICAL WILL, URGED THEM TO PROMOTE NIEO,
                            AND EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT AT SLOW PROGRESS IN CIEC AND IN
                            IMPLEMENTING RESOLUTIONS OF 6TH AND 7TH SPECIAL SESSION AND UNCTAD IV.
                            IT CALLED FOR 32ND GA ASSESSMENT OF THESE RESOLUTIONS, INTERNATIONAL

                            THE US DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATIONS. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN OTHER
                            WEOS AND CO-SPONSORS PRODUCED ONLY LIMITED IMPROVEMENTS. THE RESOLUTION
                            WAS ADOPTED BY 128-1(US)-8(<gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            COUNTRIES). US STATEMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY SAME AS ON CIEC RESOLUTION. WE
                            CAN EXPECT THE NIEO TO BE FREQUENT STANDARD PROBLEM IN G-77 RESOLUTIONS
                            ON NORTH/SOUTH ISSUES.</p>
                        <p>D. DEBT. THE SECRETARY'S UNGA SPEECH NOTED US PROPOSALS FOR DEALING WITH

                            RESOLUTION CONTAINING THE LDCS' CIEC DEBT POSITION. DESPITE US, EC-9 AND

                            DEBT POSITION IN CIEC, SUDANESE REVISION OF ORIGINAL RESOLUTION PASSED
                            BY 99-1(US)-31 (ALL WEO'S AND SOVIET BLOC, EXCEPT ROMANIA). US NOTED
                            RESOLUTION'S INAPPROPRIATENESS SINCE CIEC CONTINUING, AND REITERATED US
                            POSITIONS INCLUDING US CONCERN FOR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF OIL IMPORTING

                            AND AUSTRALIA ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE RESOLUTION WOULD PREJUDICE

                            NOT ACCEPT 0.7 PERCENT TARGET. SOVIET BLOC EXPLAINED IT ABSTAINED AS NOT
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR LDCS' ECONOMIC PLIGHT. THE ODA TARGET ON WHICH WEO UNITY
                            IS WEAK WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT LDC POSITION IN CIEC AND IN

                            RESOLUTIONS. IN NEGOTIATIONS, MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES WERE DEBT AND
                            COMMODITIES. THE ORIGINAL DRAFT GAVE UNCTAD <gloss target="#t_TDB1"

                            INTERPRETATIONS, US RECALLED THAT UNCTAD PREVIOUSLY LIMITED TDB

                            SOUTHERN AFRICA. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES GAVE GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THESE AND
                            MAINTAINED CLOSE SOLIDARITY ON THEM. ON OTHER POLITICAL ISSUES LDCS WERE
                            CONSIDERABLY MORE OPEN TO ARGUMENT AND IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER.
                            THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF DISARMAMENT AND OUTER SPACE ISSUES.</p>

                            RESOLUTION. VIGOROUS LOBBYING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF
                            AFFIRMATIVE VOTES FROM LAST YEAR AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

                            RESOLUTIONS CONDEMNED RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA,
                            CONDEMNED CREATION OF TRANSKEI, AND ENDORSED ARMED STRUGGLE TO LIBERATE
                            SOUTH AFRICA. ONE OF THESE, OPPOSED BY THE US, CALLED ON SECURITY
                            COUNCIL TO IMPOSE ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA. WE NOW EXPECT THE
                            SC TO MEET EARLY NEXT YEAR TO CONSIDER BOTH A MANDATORY ARMS EMBARGO AND

                            CONSENSUS DESPITE HARD RADICAL AFRICAN FIGHT TO REMOVE ANY POSITIVE
                            MENTION OF GENEVA CONFERENCE. THE SANCTIONS RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED
                            121-0-7(US). IN EXPLANATION OF VOTE US OBJECTED TO BEING SINGLED OUT FOR
                            CRITICISM WHILE OTHERS WITH MORE EXTENSIVE RHODESIA TRADE WERE
                            IGNORED.</p>
                        <p>C. ARAB-ISRAEL ISSUES. THE CURRENT ARAB PEACE OFFENSIVE DOMINATED 31ST
                            UNGA'S MIDDLE EAST DELIBERATIONS, AND HEAVILY INFLUENCED CONCURRENT
                            SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATES. IN NOVEMBER, A COUNCIL CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON
                            THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, INTER ALIA, EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER ISRAEL'S
                            CONTINUED OCCUPATION, ASKED ISRAEL TO FACILITATE RETURN OF THE REFUGEES,
                            REAFFIRMED APPLICABILITY OF THE FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION, AND DECLARED
                            INVALID ISRAELI CHANGES IN STATUS OF JERUSALEM. THE US SUPPORTED THE
                            CONSENSUS STATEMENT WHICH DID NOT GO BEYOND POSITIONS WE HAD TAKEN IN
                            THE PAST. THE GA ADOPTED IN DECEMBER A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR EARLY
                            RECONVENING OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE AND FOR SYG TO REPORT ON THIS. THE
                            US (WITH ISRAEL) OPPOSED BECAUSE OF TIMETABLES RESOLUTION IMPOSED ON THE
                            NEW US ADMINISTRATION. IN BOTH CASES, THE ARABS ATTEMPTED TO FORCE THE
                            PACE OF NEGOTIATIONS ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THEMSELVES, WHILE FURTHER
                            ISOLATING ISRAEL.</p>
                        <p>OUR OVERALL OBJECTIVES IN THE ARAB-ISRAEL CONFLICT DICTATED
                            DAMAGE-LIMITING STRATEGY IN 31ST UNGA. WE RECOGNIZED THAT THE UN HAS
                            ROLE BOTH IN MIDDLE EAST PEACEKEEPING, AND IN SECURITY COUNCIL
                            RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FRAMEWORK OF NEGOTIATIONS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE
                            THAT ONE-SIDED UNGA EFFORTS TO PRESCRIBE NATURE AND TIME-TABLE OF A
                            SETTLEMENT MAINLY HARDEN PARTIES' POSITIONS AND DEFLECT SERIOUS EFFORTS
                            TO NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT. THUS 31ST UNGA'S CONSIDERATION OF MIDDLE EAST
                            WAS IN OUR VIEW NEGATIVE; HOWEVER, DAMAGE DONE WAS MUCH LESS THAN
                            RESULTED FROM THE <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> SPECTACULARS AND
                            ZIONISM/RACISM BATTLES OF PAST ASSEMBLIES.</p>
                        <p>D. ZIONISM/RACISM. THE ZIONISM/RACISM ISSUE, WHICH CAUSED SUCH NOTORIETY
                            WHEN ADOPTED AS 30TH GA'S RESOLUTION 3379 IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECADE
                            TO COMBAT RACISM, WAS GENERALLY MUTED THIS YEAR. RESOLUTION 3379 STILL
                            STANDS. HOWEVER, BEGINNING AT THE SPRING SESSION OF ECOSOC, SOME
                            MODERATE AFRICANS LED BY ECOSOC PRESIDENT AKE OF IVORY COAST, SOUGHT
                            SUCCESSFULLY TO DEFUSE THE ISSUE IN ECOSOC AND THE GA BY AVOIDING
                            EXPLICIT CITATION OF RESOLUTION 3379 IN ACTIONS ON THE DECADE.</p>
                        <p>TWO RESOLUTIONS ON THE DECADE CONTAINING NO DIRECT REFERENCES TO
                            ZIONISM/RACISM WERE ADOPTED IN THE GA. A NUMBER OF WESTERN EUROPEAN
                            COUNTRIES, AND SOME OTHERS, ABSTAINED. THE US HAS A CONSISTENT POLICY OF
                            NOT PARTICIPATING IN VOTES ON DECADE RESOLUTIONS UNTIL THE LINK BETWEEN
                            THE DECADE AND RESOLUTION 3379 IS BROKEN BY A RESOLUTION WHICH
                            ESTABLISHES AS RELEVANT TO THE DECADE ONLY THOSE GA RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED
                            BY CONSENSUS. ACCORDINGLY US DID NOT VOTE ON THE TWO 31ST UNGA DECADE
                            RESOLUTIONS, BUT STATED ITS REGRET THAT THE DECADE'S ORIGINAL CONSENSUS
                            HAD BEEN BROKEN BY RESOLUTION 3379, AND ITS HOPE THAT DECADE'S ORIGINAL
                            OBJECTIVES COULD BE RESTORED.</p>
                        <p>E. CYPRUS. UNGA CONSIDERATION OF CYPRUS WAS GENERALLY AS IN PREVIOUS
                            SESSIONS. A NON-ALIGNED RESOLUTION WAS ADOPTED BY 94(GREECE,
                            CYPRUS)-1(TURKEY)-27(US). IT WAS SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR TO, AND CALLED
                            FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF, PREVIOUS GA AND SC CYPRUS RESOLUTIONS. TURKISH
                            CYPRIOT REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN PRELIMINARY SPECIAL
                            POLITICAL COMMITTEE (<gloss target="#t_SPC2">SPC</gloss>) DEBATE ON
                            CYPRUS AS A PROTEST OF GA'S REJECTION OF TURKEY'S REQUEST THAT ENTIRE
                            DEBATE BE HELD EITHER IN PLENARY OR SPC. TURKEY UNDERSCORED IMPORTANCE
                            IT GAVE TO EQUAL STATUS FOR TURK AND GREEK CYPRIOTS BY MOVING GENERAL
                            COMMITTEE RECONSIDER ALLOCATION OF CYPRUS DEBATE. MOTION LOST
                            23(US)-70-23.</p>
                        <p>GA TREATMENT OF CYPRUS GENERALLY SERVED US OBJECTIVE OF AVOIDING BOTH
                            HARDENING OF POSITIONS, AND ADDITIONAL OBSTACLES TO SUBSTANTIVE
                            NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>F. DISARMAMENT. THE 31ST UNGA ADOPTED 21 DISARMAMENT RELATED RESOLUTIONS.
                            MOST REITERATED PREVIOUS UNGA ACTIONS. ELEVEN DEALT WITH NUCLEAR ISSUES
                            SUCH AS NUCLEAR TESTING, NUCLEAR-WEAPON-FREE ZONES, NON-PROLIFERATION,
                            AND NUCLEAR NON-USE ASSURANCES. OF THESE, US OPPOSED A RESOLUTION ON
                            SALT, AND ABSTAINED ON TWO COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN RESOLUTIONS (SPONSORED
                            BY USSR AND NEW ZEALAND, RESPECTIVELY), USSR RESOLUTION ON WEAPONS OF
                            MASS DESTRUCTION, SRI LANKA'S INDIAN OCEAN PEACE ZONE RESOLUTION, AND
                            PAKISTANI RESOLUTIONS ON SOUTH ASIAN NUCLEAR-WEAPON-FREE ZONE AND
                            SECURITY ASSURANCES.</p>
                        <p>THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT DISARMAMENT RESOLUTIONS WERE US-SOVIET-FINNISH
                            RESOLUTION OPENING ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATION CONVENTION (<gloss
                                target="#t_ENMOD1">ENMOD</gloss>) FOR SIGNATURE AND RATIFICATION,
                            AND YUGOSLAV RESOLUTION CALLING FOR UNGA SPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENT
                                (<gloss target="#t_SSOD1">SSOD</gloss>) IN 1978. THERE WILL BE A
                            PREPARATORY CONFERENCE FOR SSOD DURING 1977. THE ENMOD RESOLUTION
                            REQUIRED CLOSE CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN US AND USSR COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT OF
                            EXTENSIVE LOBBYING OF OTHER DELEGATIONS. THIS COLLABORATION REVIVED
                            COMPLAINTS BY NON-ALIGNED AND OTHER LDCS THAT SUPERPOWERS DOMINATE AND
                            PREEMPT GA'S WORK ON MOST IMPORTANT DISARMAMENT ISSUES. THEY ACCORDINGLY
                            STRONGLY SUPPORTED SSOD IN WHICH THEY WILL BE IN EQUALITY WITH
                            SUPERPOWERS. OTHERWISE, DISARMAMENT DEBATE AT THE 1976 UNGA MET BASIC US
                            INTERESTS: DEBATE WAS RESTRAINED, SOVIET PROPAGANDA-ORIENTED EFFORTS
                            SUCH AS THE WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE WERE REJECTED, COORDINATION
                            WITH OUR ALLIES INCREASED, AND RESOLUTIONS IN WHICH WE HAD PARTICULAR
                            INTEREST, SUCH AS ENMOD, <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, CHEMICAL
                            WARFARE AND MILITARY EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS, RECEIVED BROAD
                            SUPPORT.</p>
                        <p>8. ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY ISSUES. A. IN LINE WITH US OBJECTIVES,
                            JOINT INSPECTION UNIT WAS CONTINUED WITH AUTHORIZATION FOR IT TO ASSIST
                            EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF UN SYSTEM ACTIVITIES. (THIS IS IMPORTANT ADVANCE
                            TOWARD ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFECTIVE, INDEPENDENT UN EXTERNAL EVALUATION IN
                            WHICH CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST.) ALSO IMPORTANT TO US
                            INTERESTS WAS RELATIVELY NONCONTROVERSIAL EXTENSION OF FUNDING FOR
                            MIDDLE EAST PEACEKEEPING FORCES. ASSEMBLY ENDORSEMENT OF RECOMMENDATIONS
                            OF INTERNATIONAL CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION WAS GOOD START TOWARD
                            RATIONALIZING UN SYSTEM SALARY STRUCTURE, ALTHOUGH WE REMAIN CONCERNED
                            ABOUT HIGH SALARY LEVELS. ALSO POSITIVE WAS SOME PROGRESS TOWARD
                            ESTABLISHMENT OF VIENNA AS A THIRD UN CITY WHICH US SUPPORTS.</p>
                        <p>B. MAJOR ITEM ON NEGATIVE SIDE, WAS SIZEABLE ADDITION TO BUDGET LEVEL
                            SUPPOSEDLY ADOPTED LAST YEAR FOR FULL 1976-77 BIENNIUM. WE GENERALLY
                            FAILED TO COMPENSATE FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS BY REDUCING OR
                            ABOLISHING CURRENT LOWER PRIORITY PROGRAMS. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES PRESSED
                            GENERALLY TO MAXIMIZE UN FUNDING FOR EXCLUSIVELY LDC ACTIVITIES. ON
                            LATTER, WE DID PREVENT PROVISION ENCOURAGING UN REGULAR BUDGET FUNDING
                            OF UN CONFERENCES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AWAY FROM UN SITES. HOWEVER,
                            WE FAILED PREVENT UNCTAD SECRETARIAT FROM ASSISTING MEETINGS SOLELY OPEN
                            AND OF INTEREST TO LDCS. TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE EXPENSES OF GOVERNMENT
                            REPRESENTATIVES ON ECOSOC'S COMMITTEE FOR PROGRAM AND CO-ORDINATION WERE
                            ALSO FUNDED OVER US OPPOSITION. THESE SETBACKS FORESHADOW FURTHER LDC
                            EFFORTS TO INCREASE FUTURE UN REGULAR BUDGET FUNDING OF ACTIVITIES
                            DESIGNED FOR LDCS EXCLUSIVELY.</p>
                        <p>C. GREAT CONTROVERSY RESULTED WHEN OPEC MEMBERS RESISTED INCREASES IN
                            THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS REQUIRED BY A PROPOSED NEW SCALE OF ASSESSMENT FOR
                            THE NEXT THREE YEARS (THERE WAS NO CHALLENGE TO 25 PERCENT CEILING WHICH
                            IS US ASSESSMENT RATE). ULTIMATELY, GA ADOPTED PROPOSED ASSESSMENT SCALE
                            FOR 1977 ONLY AND REMANDED THE DISPUTES OVER CRITERIA TO SPRING SESSION
                            OF ENLARGED COMMITTEE ON CONTRIBUTIONS. EXTENSION FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF AD
                            HOC COMMITTEE ON RESTRUCTURING OF UN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SECTORS
                            DELAYED, BUT LEFT OPEN, ACHIEVEMENT OF A US OBJECTIVE HIGHLIGHTED IN
                            SECRETARY'S 7TH SPECIAL SESSION ADDRESS.</p>
                        <p>9. HUMAN RIGHTS. A. EXTENSIVE DEBATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WAS IN MANY RESPECTS
                            DISAPPOINTING. IT PROVIDED NO NEW PRACTICAL AND EVENHANDED STEPS FOR
                            PARTICULAR HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS OR IMPROVING UN'S HUMAN RIGHTS
                            MACHINERY. GOVERNOR <persName corresp="#p_SWW2">SCRANTON</persName> MADE
                            A HARD-HITTING, DETAILED SPEECH DISCUSSING THESE FAILURES.</p>
                        <p>B. A RESOLUTION CRITICIZING HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN CHILE WAS ADOPTED
                            BY A LARGE MAJORITY. THE US ABSTAINED BECAUSE RESOLUTION IGNORED, EXCEPT
                            FOR VERY OBSCURE PREAMBLE REFERENCE, RECENT RELEASE OF POLITICAL
                            PRISONERS THERE, AND BECAUSE IT THREATENED FUTURE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. OF
                            NUMEROUS RESOLUTIONS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA, MANY INVOLVED HUMAN RIGHTS
                            QUESTIONS. THE ONLY FOLLOW-UP TO LAST YEAR'S DECLARATION CONDEMNING
                            TORTURE WAS PROCEDURAL RESOLUTION ENDORSING WORK UNDERWAY TO IMPLEMENT
                            IT. US SUPPORTED SWEDISH PROPOSAL TO SAFEGUARD HUMAN RIGHTS OF POLITICAL
                            PRISONERS WHICH WAS SIDETRACKED BY BYELORUSSIAN COUNTER PROPOSAL. BOTH
                            WERE DEFERRED TO 1977. </p>
                        <p>C. THE US CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVES. SUCH AS
                            IMPROVEMENT IN PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING PRIVATE COMPLAINTS OF VIOLATIONS
                            AND A GA SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO STUDY NATURE AND EXTENT OF TORTURE. WE
                            CONSULTED CLOSELY WITH FRIENDLY COUNTRIES TO OBTAIN SUPPORT. THE
                            REACTION WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC AND WE CONCLUDE IT WOULD BE USELESS, OR
                            WORSE, TO PUSH SUCH PROPOSALS WITHOUT WIDE AND ENTHUSIASTIC BACKING. WE
                            MAY SEEK SUCH SUPPORT BEFORE 32ND UNGA.</p>
                        <p>10. INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THE GA PROGRESSED HERE IN ADOPTING BY
                            CONSENSUS AN FRG RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING A 35-NATION COMMITTEE TO DRAFT
                            AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES. THE
                            RESOLUTION IS LESS EXPLICIT IN CONDEMNING HOSTAGE-TAKING THAN WE, THE
                            FRG, AND CO-SPONSORS, WOULD LIKE. IN NEGOTIATIONS THE FRG DID
                            SUCCESSFULLY AVOID A DISTORTING AMENDMENT BY LIBYA LIMITING DRAFT
                            CONVENTION TO (QUOTE) INNOCENT (UNQUOTE) HOSTAGES. HOWEVER, SOME ARAB
                            AND OTHER STATES (E.G., CZECHOSLOVAKIA, KENYA, NIGERIA, TANZANIA) DID
                            NOT RESPECT EFFORTS IN DEBATE ON FRG RESOLUTION TO KEEP HOSTAGE ISSUE
                            SEPARATE FROM BROADER ISSUE OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND ITS
                            UNDERLYING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CAUSES.</p>
                        <p>11. ASSESSMENT. A. OVERALL, 31ST UNGA SHOWED UNUSUAL REALISM, PRAGMATISM,
                            AND CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES IN RESOLUTIONS. UNTIL
                            ANOTHER SESSION, HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT KNOW WHETHER THIS ONE WAS A
                            TURNING POINT OR A LULL. CYNICAL OR IMPATIENT MISUSE OF THE GA FOR
                            RHETORICAL POSTURING AND PROCLAIMING OF NON-NEGOTIABLE STATEMENTS OF
                            PRINCIPLE, RATHER THAN AS A FORUM CONSTRUCTIVELY ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT
                            REQUIRE SERIOUS ATTENTION, IS STILL FAR TOO PREVALENT. THIS MISUSE MAY
                            WELL AGAIN BECOME PREEMINENT IF KOREA AND OTHER DIVISIVE POLITICAL
                            ISSUES RETURN TO JOIN MIDDLE EAST QUESTION AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN ISSUES
                            IN THE GA, OR IF DISSATISFACTION WITH PROGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC
                            ISSUES CONTINUES TO MOUNT.</p>
                        <p>B. WE BALANCE THIS CONTINUING CONCERN WITH SOME MODEST HOPE. WALDHEIM'S
                            RE-ELECTION FOR A FULL FIVE YEARS PROVIDES CONTINUITY WITH A SYG WITH
                            WHOM WE KNOW WE CAN WORK, AND STRENGTHENS HIM IN HIS ROLE IN IMPORTANT
                            INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS (E.G., CYPRUS) AHEAD. THE RELATIONS OF OTHER
                            DELEGATIONS WITH OUR OWN TESTIFIED TO THE EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP ROLE OF
                            THE US; INDEED, DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR CONTINUED TO PRESS US
                            TO EXERCISE THIS ROLE MORE FREELY. WE WERE IN A SMALL MINORITY IN
                            OPPOSITION ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES. NONETHELESS, THE GA, AS A FORUM FOR
                            THE COLLECTIVE OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WAS CLEARLY
                            TELLING US AGAIN THAT IT EXPECTS US TO BE A LEADER WITHIN AND OUTSIDE
                            THE UN ON ECONOMIC ISSUES, ON SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND ON THE MIDDLE EAST.

                            SYG. AS STAVROPOULOS KNEW, SYG WAS ALREADY SKATING ON VERY THIN ICE WITH

                        <p>2. STAVROPOULOS SAID THAT HE WAS 100 PERCENT AGAINST THE GRANTING OF
                            LIAISON OFFICE STATUS TO PRG AND HAD OPPOSED IT FROM THE START. HE
                            ARGUED HOWEVER THAT SYG MUST BE FREE TO CARRY OUT HIS RESPONSIBILITIES
                            TO BE IN TOUCH WITH ALL PARTIES AND THAT IT WOULD BE INCUMBENT ON USG TO

                            INSTRUCTED SHORTLY TO MAKE APPROACHES TO HOST GOVERNMENT BASED ON
                            FOLLOWING INFORMATION.</p>
                        <p>2. NORTH KOREAN MEMBERSHIP IN WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) IS ON
                            AGENDA OF 26TH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY (WHA) WHICH OPENS IN GENEVA MAY 7.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> HAS AGREED TO SUPPORT REPUBLIC
                            OF KOREA EFFORT PERSUADE WHA TO POSTPONE CONSIDERATION OF NORTH KOREA' S
                            APPLICATION UNTIL 27 TH WHA IN 1974. WE HAVE TOLD SOUTH KOREANS WE

                            PROMISES TO BE EFFECTIVE, AND ALSO AT WHA.</p>
                        <p>3. US REASONS FOR SUPPORTING POSTPONEMENT OF NORTH KOREAN APPLICATION
                            ARE:</p>
                        <p>A. WE BELIEVE THAT AIRING AT THIS TIME IN WHA OF SO CONTENTIOUS AN ISSUE
                            AS NORTH KOREAN MEMBERSHIP IN <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> FAMILY
                            COULD JEOPARDIZE CHANCES FOR PROGRESS IN NORTH-SOUTH TALKS AND UNDERMINE
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> CONFIDENCE. AT ROK INITIATIVE,
                            ROK AND NORTH KOREA CONSULTED TOGETHER, ISSUED JOINT COMMUNIQUE IN JULY
                            1972, AND HAVE SINCE CARRIED ON TALKS WHICH HAVE POTENTIAL FOR DIRECT
                            AND IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO GREATER PEACE AND STABILITY IN NORTHEAST
                            ASIA. NORTH-SOUTH TALKS, HOWEVER, ARE STILL IN DELICATE INITIAL STAGES
                            AND FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES REMAIN. ONE SUCH DIFFERENCE IS UN ROLE IN
                            KOREA (USEFUL BACKGROUND CONTAINED <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1"
                                >REFTEL</gloss>). BEST MEANS TO FACILITATE TALKS, IN OUR JUDGMENT,
                            IS TO LET TWO PARTIES WORK OUT THEIR PROBLEMS TOGETHER WITHOUT
                            ENCUMBRANCE OF POSSIBLY ACRIMONIOUS DEBATE IN INTERNATIONAL
                            ORGANIZATIONS.</p>
                        <p>B. QUIET NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH KOREA ARE LOGICALLY
                            ANALOGOUS TO APPROACH WHICH ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN <gloss

                            HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT HAD THEY BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY DEBATE IN
                            INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. END FYI.) MEMBERS OF WHO RECOGNIZED THIS BY
                            POSTPONING, AT THREE SUCCESSIVE WHA' S, CONSIDERATION OF GDR MEMBERSHIP
                            APPLICATION SO THAT FRG-GDR TALKS COULD REACH FRUITION WITHOUT PUBLIC
                            AIRING OF EXISTING DIFFERENCES. GDR WILL PRESUMABLY RECEIVE NECESSARY
                            MAJORITY TO ENTER WHO AT 26TH WHA IN MAY.</p>
                        <p>C. QUESTION OF NORTH KOREAN PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
                            IS POLITICAL ISSUE WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY MAJOR UN POLITICAL
                            FORUM RATHER THAN BY TECHNICAL SUBSIDIARY BODIES SUCH AS WHO. IN ABSENCE
                            OF DECISION BY MAJOR POLITICAL UN FORUM THAT NORTH KOREA IS QUALIFIED
                            FOR MEMBERSHIP IN UN SYSTEM, IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR WHO TO TAKE
                            ANY DECISION HAVING EFFECT OF INCLUDING NORTH KOREA IN WHO' S
                            PROCEEDINGS.</p>
                        <p>D. WE OPPOSE SEATING NORTH KOREAN OBSERVERS AT WHA BECAUSE THIS IS
                            INTEGRALLY RELATED TO QUESTION OF MEMBERSHIP AND SHOULD NOT BE DECIDED
                            IN ADVANCE OF DECISION ON MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION. AS FAR AS WE ARE
                            AWARE, THERE HAS BEEN NO REQUEST FROM NORTH KOREA FOR THIS STATUS.</p>
                        <p>4. FYI. WE EXPECT POSTPONEMENT OF NORTH KOREAN APPLICATION WILL BE
                            DIFFICULT, GIVEN FACT THAT ADMISSION TO WHO IS BY SIMPLE (NOT
                            TWO-THIRDS) MAJORITY VOTE BY WHA, RECENT RECOGNITIONS OF NORTH KOREA BY
                            VARIOUS STATES, HUMANITARIAN NATURE OF WHO, AND CONCURRENT ADMISSION OF
                            GDR, ANOTHER " DIVIDED STATE" AT SAME WHA. PRESUMABLY, HOWEVER, SEVERAL
                            STATES WHICH HAVE RECENTLY RECOGNIZED NORTH KOREA WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE
                            TO POSTPONEMENT THAN TO OPPOSING APPLICATION. TACTICALLY, POSTPONEMENT
                            WOULD COME TO VOTE BEFORE MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND THEREBY PERMIT
                            MEMBERS TO OPT FOR INSCRIPTION ON AGENDA OF NEXT SESSION RATHER THAN
                            AGAINST APPLICATION AS SUCH. ROK FONOFF' S ROUGH SURVEY SHOWS CURRENT
                            VOTE MARGIN OF 18 IN FAVOR OF POSTPONEMENT. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>5. WE HAVE ASKED ROK TO HOLD EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH US CONCERNING RESULTS
                            OF SOUTH KOREAN APPROACHES MADE ALREADY, AND CAPITALS WHERE OUR
                            ASSISTANCE WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO SOUTH KOREAN CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE
                            AGREED TO SUPPORT ROK EFFORTS IN THIS MANNER PARTLY TO MINIMIZE
                            POSSIBILITY OF UNHELPFUL CONFRONTATION BETWEEN US AND OTHER GREAT

                        <p>--Agreed to the termination of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>
                            and to hold in abeyance consideration of the future of the U.N. Command

                            pro quo could be gained from the other side by its elimination."</p>
                        <p>--Expressed strong support for the Republic of Korea's (<gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) initiative to secure membership for
                            both Koreas (he now recommends that the U.S. undertake a campaign to
                            this end, using this effort to counter the Communist side's anticipated.
                            campaign against the UNC and U.S. forces in the. ROK).</p>
                        <p>--Assured ROK leaders that we are well aware of their interest in our
                            taking up with Peking and Moscow the Korean question in the U.N.</p>
                        <p>Our major objective in dealing with the Korean question in this UNGA
                            session should be to minimize the risk of a major confrontation there,
                            while assuring the retention of the UNC until we can secure satisfactory
                            alternative security arrangements. We will not, until early next month,
                            have a clear idea of how the Communist side intends to proceed
                            tactically. We are, however, sufficiently aware of their general
                            intentions to define our basic strategy now, and should do so in order
                            to retain the initiative gained by President Park in his speech of June
                            23.</p>
                        <p>--I agree with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWD1">Rogers</persName>
                            that UNCURK's report recommending its own termination should be
                            submitted as soon as possible in order to sustain momentum on this
                            issue, but believe we should not follow this up with a formal UNGA
                            resolution on the report unless the other side attempts to have UNCURK
                            terminated with prejudice to its past activities.</p>
                        <p>--The desirability of accepting any quid pro quo that is likely to be
                            offered at the UNGA for the termination of UNC, is highly questionable.
                            It is doubtful that the Communist side would, at this point: (1) give us
                            a trade-off adequate to insure the continuation of security arrangements
                            related to the UNC such as the Armistice Agreement and the Military
                            Armistice Commission; (2) agree, at least tacitly, to reduce political
                            pressure on our forces in the ROK. Thus, we should take the full time
                            necessary between now and next year's UNGA to work out, with the other
                            side and with the ROK and Japan, adjustments in UNC-related security
                            arrangements that would avoid any reduction in the ROK's security which
                            might result from a hasty termination of the Command. Finally, we have a
                            good chance of holding the line against hostile action by the General
                            Assembly against the UNC and U.S. forces in the ROK this year. If
                            necessary, we can always block action against the UNC in the Security
                            Council, which as the U.N. agency which created the UNC is the only body
                            empowered to terminate it.</p>
                        <p>--While a preliminary survey indicates very substantial support for
                            simultaneous admission of both Koreas to the UNGA, the other side
                            could--and very likely would--veto the proposal in the Security Council.
                            More importantly, there are substantial risks in attempting to counter
                            the opposition's campaign against the UNC and U.S. forces with a
                            campaign of our own for simultaneous admission. It would probably
                            stimulate the other side to step up its campaign against the UNC and
                            U.S. forces, thus producing the major confrontation we are seeking to
                            avoid. We should, therefore, try to persuade the ROK to press its
                            campaign for simultaneous admission less vigorously. We should, at the
                            same time, assure the ROK of our support for a lower-key effort that
                            would give us the tactical leverage this issue can provide against
                            efforts to press for a hostile resolution on the UNC and U.S. forces in
                            the ROK.</p>

                            position on the U.N. Command (UNC) and UNCURK.</p>
                        <p>--We should seek to have the UNCURK report recommending termination of
                            the organization submitted as soon as possible. We should not favor a
                            formal UNGA resolution on the report, however, unless the Communist side
                            attempts to have UNCURK terminated with prejudice to its past
                            activities, or unless necessary to retain the initiative on UNCURK.</p>
                        <p>--Our objective is to defeat any moves at this UNGA aimed at terminating
                            the UNC. We should, therefore, undertake immediate representations to
                            all potentially responsive <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members
                            setting forth this position and explaining the substantial differences
                            between the UNC and UNCURK.</p>
                        <p>--Regarding the simultaneous admission of both Koreas to U.N. membership,
                            we should try to persuade the ROK to press its campaign less vigorously,
                            in order to avoid stimulating the opposition to take greater efforts in
                            support of a hostile resolution on the UNC, and U.S. forces in the ROK.
                            The U.S. should be prepared to give modest support to the ROK' s efforts
                            to secure simultaneous admission in order (a) to support our Korean
                            ally, and (b) to avail ourselves of the tactical leverage this issue can
                            provide against possible opposition efforts to press for a hostile
                            resolution on the UNC and U.S. forces in the ROK. The proposal for
                            simultaneous admission should be phrased in a way that does not seem to
                            impose U.N. membership on North Korea. At the same time, our effort both
                            as regards simultaneous admission arid the UNC/U.S. forces should be
                            keyed to deal effectively with the level and character of challenge that
                            be raised by the opposition.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above, a study should be prepared presenting options
                            and related scenarios on the following questions, and should be
                            submitted for the President's consideration no later than August 30:</p>
                        <p>--How we might prevent the UNC and U.S. forces in the ROK from becoming
                            the center of a full-blown debate in this fall's UNGA.</p>
                        <p>--How we might prevent the opposition from mobilizing majority support
                            for UNGA action against the UNC and U.S. forces in the ROK.</p>
                        <p>--How both legally and institutionally we could protect the continued
                            effectiveness of the Armistice Agreement and the Military Armistice
                            Commission, assuming a major attack on the UNG.</p>

                        <p>KHMER REPUBLIC/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: CAN PHNOM PENH SURVIVE
                            CREDENTIALS CHALLENGE?</p>
                        <p>Since July the Albanian UN delegation in New York--at the request of
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>--has been
                            sounding out possible co-sponsors for inscribing on the 28th UN General
                            Assembly agenda a resolution calling for the expulsion of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LN2">Lon Nol</persName>'s delegation and the seating of
                            Prince Sihanouk's representatives. While it is not clear whether
                            Sihanouk will persist with this course, it is almost certain that the
                            Khmer Republic's credentials will be challenged in both the Credentials
                            Committee and the General Assembly, in either late September or early
                            December. Given the improved international position of Sihanouk and his
                            government-in-exile as a result of the recent Fourth Non-Aligned
                            Conference in Algiers, and a possible worsening of the military
                            situation in Cambodia, the unseating of the Khmer Republic delegation at
                            this General Assembly is a distinct possibility.</p>
                        <p>Credentials Committee: First Battleground. The rules of the UN require
                            that credentials must pass muster in the Credentials Committee, where
                            the issue will be joined first. Hence, the composition of this Committee
                            is of considerable importance. The Credentials Committee is a nine-man
                            Committee appointed at the outset of every General Assembly session by
                            the President pro tem of the General Assembly. In accordance with
                            established practice, however, the President simply approves a list of
                            nominees selected by the Secretary-General's Legal Advisor, who strives
                            to obtain a politically and geographically balanced Committee by
                            consulting all parties concerned. The UN General Assembly in the past
                            always has concurred in this action.</p>
                        <p>In the present instance, the Legal Advisor's initial fears that he might
                            have difficulty in selecting a balanced Committee that would accept
                            Khmer credentials, as it did last year, proved groundless. His
                            anticipation that these difficulties would originate with the People's
                            Republic of China, whose delegation has shown a growing awareness and
                            sophistication as well as interest in the workings of the Credentials
                            Committee, did not materialize. Consequently, the Legal Advisor again
                            selected a Credentials Committee with four delegates expected to vote
                            against Khmer credentials and five in favor--with Japan holding the key
                            position, as it did last time.</p>
                        <p>Abortive Attempt Last Year. Last year's effort to put Sihanouk's Royal
                            Government of National Union of Khmer (<gloss target="#t_GRUNK1"
                                >GRUNK</gloss>) over the top failed when the Senegalese UN mission,
                            which had taken the lead in pushing Sihanouk's case, encountered trouble
                            in collecting co-sponsors for a resolution challenging Phnom Penh's
                            credentials. The Senegalese finally admitted that their effort to get
                            Sihanouk into the UN was doomed in the General Assembly and, therefore,
                            withdrew in agreement with friendly countries and upon the
                            recommendation of Sihanouk himself. On the other hand, they proceeded to
                            challenge the credentials of the Khmer Republic in the Credentials
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>That gambit failed by a margin of two because the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decided to abstain on the Khmer
                            credentials issue. Subsequently, in early December 1972, the Committee's
                            report, recommending that all credentials be accepted, was approved
                            after the Committee rejected a Senegalese amendment, with vocal support
                            from China and others, to take no action on the Khmer delegation's
                            credentials. Following this defeat in the Committee, however, Senegal
                            failed to take the issue to the Assembly floor, partly because its
                            efforts did not receive support from certain key non-aligned
                            delegations, such as Algeria and Tanzania, and partly because of
                            pressure from such other non-aligned countries as Argentina. Another
                            important factor working against Sihanouk was an effective Khmer
                            lobbying campaign in New York and throughout the rest of the world which
                            convinced his supporters that sentiment still favored the Lon Nol
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Time and Tactics. In all these intricate maneuvers, timing is an
                            important factor. For years, the General Assembly vote on the
                            Credentials Committee's report had been postponed until late
                            November-early December in order to avoid an acrimonious debate over the
                            Chirep credentials. In principle, the Credentials Committee's report can
                            be called at any time for Assembly approval, particularly in cases where
                            the Committee is confronted with two sets of credentials. Thus, a
                            challenge to the Khmer's credentials, requiring only a simple majority
                            (68 votes) of the 135 UN members, could come as early as September or as
                            late as December. The Lon Nol regime, naturally, would prefer to see
                            such a confrontation later rather than earlier, as it would provide more
                            lobbying time and also, hopefully, an abatement of the enthusiasm
                            generated by the Algiers Non-Aligned Conference for ousting the Lon Nol
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Assembly Vote Uncertain. What is critical in this year's situation is the
                            apparent slippage that the Lon Nol regime has suffered in the General
                            Assembly. Already last year, debate on the Credentials Committee's
                            report found a surprisingly large number of Africans speaking against
                            the Khmer Republic and a failure of the Asians (and especially Japan) to
                            support the Khmer in the debate. This was a bad omen despite the fact
                            that tentative vote estimates still showed that there would have been
                            sizable support for the Lon Nol regime had the issue been put to a vote.
                            What is particularly troubling is that another attempt might be made to
                            link the Khmer credentials issue with that of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Although the two cases are dissimilar, the 1972 UN General Assembly
                            adopted an African amendment to the Credentials Committee's report which
                            took exception to South Africa's credentials by a margin slightly
                            greater than in 1971. While representation is not the issue in South
                            Africa's case, the danger lies in the fact that Senegal might seek again
                            to couple the two questions in the Credentials Committee.</p>
                        <p>In the current session Lon Nol will have to overcome Sihanouk's triumph
                            at the Non-Aligned Conference as well as the fact that a growing list of
                            states have extended full diplomatic recognition to Sihanouk, bringing
                            the total of those states recognizing his government to 45, 43 of which
                            are UN members. In addition, the final political declaration from
                            Algiers contained several statements of support for Sihanouk, declaring
                            his regime to be the sole legitimate and legal government and calling on
                            all non-aligned states to accord it immediate recognition.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that Non-Aligned Conference decisions are taken by
                            consensus, which at times is far short of unanimity. Hence, Sihanouk
                            cannot count on the backing of all 76 participating countries of the
                            Non-Aligned Group in New York. Nevertheless, that amorphous assemblage
                            is showing an increasing readiness to flex its muscle, and Sihanouk
                            undoubtedly has increased the number of his supporters who are willing
                            to translate their support into votes at the coming UN General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are indications that the Chinese will work for him,
                            probably through third parties, but it is unclear whether they are
                            sufficiently impressed with the importance of this issue to push it to
                            the limit. Last year they appeared reluctant to support a challenge in
                            the Assembly. Again, though evidence is lacking, there is little reason
                            to doubt that President Senghor again will press the case of his friend
                            Sihanouk. Finally, the military situation in the Khmer Republic and the
                            instability of the government are other crucial factors that could swing
                            votes against the Khmer or at least into the abstention column.</p>
                        <p>On the plus side, the Khmer delegation, led by Foreign Minister Long
                            Boret, will be lobbying widely in New York. They will be assisted by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ASEAN1">ASEAN</gloss> states--Indonesia, Malaysia,
                            Singapore, Thailand, and Philippines--plus Australia, which are not only
                            concerting to work out their strategy in New York but are also planning
                            to make a multinational statement in support of the Khmer Republic. It
                            is questionable, however, that such a demonstration of non-recognition
                            of Sihanouk and the GRUNK will change the votes of many African-Arab
                            states.</p>
                        <p>Prospects. At this time, it is difficult to predict the outcome of any
                            battle over the Khmer's credentials until the nature of the opposition's
                            tactics is known. Reports in July indicated that Sihanouk's supporters
                            might try to inscribe an item on the agenda of the UN General Assembly,
                            presumably similar to the old Chirep resolution, expelling the Khmer
                            delegation and seating Sihanouk's representatives. This tactic was
                            shelved by Sihanouk himself last year. It also has been questioned by
                            some his supporters this year as being too drastic a measure for UN
                            members to swallow, i.e., they would have to face up to the fact that
                            rejection of credentials meant expulsion of the Khmer delegation.
                            Although there is no further information that Sihanouk actually intends
                            to pursue this approach, it is still a possibility in view of his
                            success at the Non-Aligned Conference and a possibly deteriorating
                            military situation.</p>
                        <p>In any event, it seems certain that a challenge will be made in the
                            Credentials Committee, probably in the form of an amendment to the
                            Committee's report which normally recommends acceptance of all
                            credentials. And unlike last year, it is doubtful that a defeat in the
                            Committee will deter Sihanouk's supporters from pressing the issue in
                            the General Assembly, where on balance, they may well have a better
                            chance of success.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> FIRST COMMITTEE NOV 21 ACCEPTED
                            CONSENSUS STATEMENT WORKED OUT BEHIND THE SCENES BY THE CO-SPONSORS OF
                            THE TWO COMPETING RESOLUTIONS. WE REGARD THE CONSENSUS STATEMENT AS A
                            CLEAR SUCCESS OF OUR DIPLOMACY, AND WISH TO THANK ALL POSTS THAT HAVE
                            CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OUTCOME. OUR COSPONSORS, NOTABLY THE <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, ARE EQUALLY DELIGHTED. (FRONTRUNNERS
                            IN WORKING OUT THE COMPROMISE WERE THE NETHERLANDS, WHO RECEIVED PUBLIC
                            THANKS FROM CO-SPONSORS.)</p>
                        <p>2. CONSENSUS AS ANNOUNCED BY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AT REQUEST OF BOTH SIDES
                            HAD THESE ELEMENTS: (A) NEITHER RES WILL BE PUT TO VOTE; (B) ENDORSEMENT
                            OF NORTH-SOUTH COMMUNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR REUNIFICATION; AND (C)
                            DISSOLUTION OF <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>. THERE IS THUS
                            NOTHING ABOUT THE UN COMMAND OR ABOUT FOREIGN TROOPS, AND UNDISTURBED
                            ATMOSPHERE CREATES BETTER CONDITIONS FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. WHILE
                            THERE WERE FIERY SPEECHES DURING THE DEBATE, CONSENSUS HAS-AVOIDED
                            BRUISING CONFRONTATION IN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLICATED PROCEDURAL
                            VOTES.</p>
                        <p>3. IN EXPRESSING OUR THANKS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE, YOU
                            SHOULD STRESS WHAT WE REGARD AS CENTRAL LESSON FROM THIS EXERCISE --
                            THAT IF DELEGATIONS WILL BAND TOGETHER FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND REASONABLE,
                            OFTEN THERE NEED BE NO VOTING BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE WILL FIND IT TO ITS
                            ADVANTAGE TO COMPROMISE. (IN A DIFFERENT BUT ANALOGOUS SITUATION, THAT
                            OF INVITING THE <gloss target="#t_PRGSV1">PRG</gloss> TO THE <gloss
                                target="#t_LOS1">LOS</gloss> CONFERENCE, THE OTHER SIDE DID NOT
                            PRESS THE ISSUE TO A VOTE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE DEFEATED.
                            THERE MAY BE LESSON IN THIS ALSO FOR THE CAMBODIAN ITEM, WHICH IS YET TO
                            COME UP AND ON WHICH VOTE MIGHT BE SIMILARLY AVOIDED IF ENOUGH COUNTRIES
                            WILL LINE UP AGAINST UN INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIR OF MEMBER
                            COUNTRY.)</p>
                        <p>4. SINCE WE WERE FOR A TIME ALMOST NECK-AND-NECK WITH THE OTHER SIDE ON
                            THE KOREAN ISSUE, YOU SHOULD KNOW (AND WHERE APPROPRIATE INFORM HOST
                            GOVT) THAT IN RECENT WEEKS WE HAD MADE STEADY PROGRESS SO THAT WE HAD
                            SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN IN FAVOR OF OUR RESOLUTION. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1"
                                >FYI</gloss>. WE DID NOT HOWEVER HAVE TWO-THIRDS WHICH MIGHT HAVE
                            BEEN NECESSARY. END FYI.) KNOWLEDGE OF OUR STRENGTHENED VOTING POSITION
                            WAS UNDOUBTEDLY MAJOR FACTOR IN OPPOSITION'S WILLINGNESS TO REACH A
                            REASONABLE COMPROMISE.</p>
                        <p>5. MOREOVER, RECENT EFFORTS BY THIRD PARTIES (E.G., TUNISIA, INDIA, SAUDI
                            ARABIA) TO PREPARE COMPROMISE RESOLUTIONS HAD RECEIVED SOME SUPPORT AND
                            COMPLICATED PARLIAMENTARY SITUATION. SOUTH KOREANS THEREFORE SUGGESTED
                            AND FRIENDLY CO-SPONSORS CONCURRED THAT POSSIBILITY OF COMPROMISE, WHICH
                            SAFEGUARDED ROK VITAL SECURITY INTERESTS, BE EXPLORED. RESULT WAS
                            CONSENSUS STATEMENT WHICH LAID THE ISSUE TO REST IN THIS GA AND THUS DID
                            NOT DISTURB ATMOSPHERE NECESSARY FOR WORKING OF QUIET DIPLOMACY.

                            NEVERTHELESS, I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S STRONG INTEREST
                            IN THIS MATTER AND ASK YOU TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WHENEVER APPROPRIATE OUR
                            VIEWS ARE CLEARLY AND CURRENTLY CONVEYED TO THIRD PARTIES. DEPT WILL
                            INSTRUCT SELECTED POSTS SEPARATELY IN CONNECTION WITH SPECIFIC
                            CONFERENCES AS THEY ARISE. MEANWHILE, EXCEPT WHERE HOST GOVERNMENTS ARE
                            FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE PRG AND/OR GRUNK, YOU SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE
                            OPPORTUNITIES, TAILORING YOUR EFFORTS TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, TO
                            COMMUNICATE FORCEFULLY AND AT AN APPROPRIATELY HIGH LEVEL OUR
                            SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CONCERNS OVER POSSIBILITY PRG OR GRUNK ENTITIES MIGHT

                            FOLLOWING AND REFTELS.</p>
                        <p>4. THE PRG AND GRUNK ARE ATTEMPTING TO GAIN THROUGH DIPLOMATIC
                            RECOGNITION AND ACCEPTANCE IN INTERNATIONAL FORA THAT WHICH NEITHER HAS
                            BEEN CAPABLE OF WINNING ON THE GROUND. THE LEGITIMATE VIETNAMESE AND
                            CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENTS ARE RESISTING VIGOROUSLY THESE ATTEMPTS TO
                            UNDERCUT AND ISOLATE THEM. SINCE SUPPORT OF THESE GOVERNMENTS REMAINS A
                            MAJOR ELEMENT OF UNITED STATES POLICY, WE WILL LEND THEM ALL POSSIBLE
                            ASSISTANCE IN THIS REGARD. WE HAVE DONE ALL IN OUR POWER TO PREVENT
                            COMMUNIST TAKEOVERS BY MILITARY MEANS IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES; WE DO NOT
                            INTEND TO ACQUIESCE IN A COMMUNIST VICTORY VIA DIPLOMATIC MEANS. IN
                            MAINTAINING OUR FIRM SUPPORT OF THE RVN AND <gloss target="#t_GKR1"
                                >GKR</gloss>, WE DEMONSTRATE TO NORTH VIETNAM OUR DETERMINATION TO
                            HOLD FIRM IN SUPPORT OF THESE TWO LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTS AND TO FRIENDLY
                            ASIAN AND OTHER STATES THAT WE CAN STILL BE RELIED UPON.</p>
                        <p>5. PRG AND GRUNK ARE NOT GOVERNMENTS, CONTROL ONLY SMALL PERCENTAGES OF
                            SVN AND CAMBODIAN PEOPLES, HAVE NO CAPITALS, BODY OF JURISPRUDENCE OR
                            OTHER ATTRIBUTES COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. IF
                            THE PRG OR GRUNK ARE PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN INTERNATIONAL
                            ORGANIZATIONS OR CONFERENCES, IT WOULD FURTHER WEAKEN THE UN SYSTEM DUE
                            TO THEIR ILLEGITIMATE CHARACTER. YOU SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT NOT ONE
                            OF THEIR NON-COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA RECOGNIZES THE PRG OR
                            GRUNK.</p>
                        <p>6. THE PRG HAS DECLINED TO NEGOTIATE SERIOUSLY WITH THE RVN; IT HAS
                            SPURNED THE LATTER'S PROPOSALS FOR ELECTIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL
                            SUPERVISION. SIMILARLY, THE GRUNK HAS THUS FAR REFUSED GKR OFFERS TO
                            TALK. ONCE THE GRUNK REALIZES IT WILL NOT WIN MILITARILY, WE HOPE IT
                            WILL CONSENT TO START NEGOTIATIONS.</p>
                        <p>7. THE BEST HOPE OF ACHIEVING A LASTING PEACE IN VIETNAM IS THROUGH THE
                            STRUCTURE OF THE PARIS PEACE AGREEMENT. RECOGNITION OF THE PRG AS A
                            LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT, WHEN THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY NOT THE CASE, WOULD IN
                            EFFECT UNDERMINE THE CAUSE OF PEACE IN SOUTH VIETNAM. THE SAME IS TRUE
                            OF PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN CAMBODIA, SHOULD THE GRUNK--AN AMORPHOUS

                                >GA</gloss> HAS VOTED TO REJECT SOUTH AFRICA'S CREDENTIALS, BUT GA
                            PRESIDENT HAS RULED ACTION TO BE CONDEMNATION WITHOUT PRACTICAL EFFECT.
                            THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT WITH ALGERIAN GA PRESIDENT, AFRICANS MAY TRY
                            EXCLUDE OR EXPEL SOUTH AFRICA FROM UN.</p>
                        <p>2. BACKGROUND: SINCE 1970, UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ANNUALLY HAS VOTED TO
                            AMEND CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE'S REPORT SO AS TO REJECT SOUTH AFRICAN
                            CREDENTIALS. EACH YEAR, GENERAL ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT HAS RULED THAT VOTE
                            CONSTITUTED STRONG CONDEMNATION OF AND WARNING TO SOUTH AFRICA, BUT THAT
                            AS CREDENTIALS CORRECTLY SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S
                            RULES OF PROCEDURE, VOTE HAD NO EFFECT ON SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION'S
                            RIGHT TO SIT AND PARTICIPATE IN ASSEMBLY.</p>
                        <p>3. THERE INDICATIONS THAT WITH ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTER <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">BOUTEFLIKA</persName> AS THIS YEAR'S GA PRESIDENT,
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> MEMBERS MAY TRY TO GO BEYOND
                            RITUALIZED CONDEMNATION OF SOUTH AFRICA OF LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE
                            AFRICANS COULD EITHER TAKE ACTION IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO REJECT SOUTH
                            AFRICA'S CREDENTIALS AND EXCLUDE SOUTH AFRICA FROM 29TH <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> SESSION, OR COULD ASK SECURITY
                            COUNCIL TO EXPEL SOUTH AFRICA FROM UN BECAUSE OF ALLEGED DISREGARD OF
                            CHARTER PRINCIPLES. IF AFRICANS ELECTED TO ACT IN GA, BOUTEFLIKA COULD
                            DEVIATE FROM PAST PRACTICE AND RULE THAT GA'S VOTE TO REJECT CREDENTIALS
                            HAD EFFECT THAT SOUTH AFRICA NO LONGER COULD PARTICIPATE IN ASSEMBLY.
                            THIS MIGHT WELL CAUSE SOUTH AFRICA TO WITHDRAW FROM UN.</p>
                        <p>4. SHOULD AFRICANS DECIDE TO TAKE STEPS INVOLVING <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> ACTION DESCRIBED REF B, THEY WOULD PROBABLY ACT UNDER
                            ARTICLE 6 OF UN CHARTER WHICH PROVIDES THAT "A MEMBER OF THE UNITED
                            NATIONS WHICH HAS PERSISTENTLY VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED
                            NATIONS CONTAINED IN THE PRESENT CHARTER MAY BE EXPELLED FROM THE
                            ORGANIZATION BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE
                            SECURITY COUNCIL." WHILE PRINCIPLES PERTAIN TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,
                            AFRICANS COULD ARGUE THAT SOUTH AFRICAN FORCES IN RHODESIA AND CAPRIVI
                            STRIP ARE USED TO THREATEN ZAMBIA CONTRARY TO ARTICLE 2(4) OF THE
                            CHARTER, OR THAT IN VIOLATION OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLES 2(2),
                            55, 56 AND 25 OF CHARTER, SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH CALL IN SC
                            RESOLUTION 264 OF MARCH 20, 1969 TO WITHDRAW FROM NAMIBIA.</p>
                        <p>5. U.S. POLICY: <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> OUR STAND TOWARDS
                            SOUTH AFRICA IN THE UN MUST BE VIEWED NOT ONLY IN LIGHT OF OUR BILATERAL
                            RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, BUT ALSO EVEN MORE AS FUNCTION OF OUR
                            RELATIONS WITH <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S, WHO CLEARLY
                            DOMINATE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WITH THEIR VOTES. SINCE INCEPTION OF UN AND
                            PARTICULARLY IN LAST 15 YEARS, US HAS TAKEN STRONG LINE AGAINST
                            APARTHEID AND HAS WORKED FOR RACIAL EQUALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA, OFTEN AT
                            SOME POLITICAL RISK THERE. ON OTHER HAND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY OPPOSED
                            ACTION BY UN WHICH WE CONSIDERED OF DOUBTFUL LEGALITY OR BADLY ADVISED.
                            WHEREAS IN 60'S U.S. WAS PART OF SIGNIFICANT IF STILL RELATIVELY SMALL
                            GROUP OF MOSTLY WESTERN STATES WHICH OPPOSED SUCH MEASURES, MORE
                            RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD LITTLE SUPPORT FROM OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES AND HAVE
                            OFTEN STOOD ISOLATED IN OPPOSITION WITH ONLY SOUTH AFRICA AND PORTUGAL,
                            AND OCCASIONALLY <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. RECENTLY WE HAVE
                            BEEN TOLD THAT UK'S LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS NO STOMACH FOR ACTIONS WHICH
                            COULD BE INTERPRETED AS ESPOUSING SOUTH AFRICA'S CAUSE. IT ALSO SEEMS
                            LIKELY THAT PORTUGAL WILL ALSO BEGIN TO PULL BACK FROM ITS PREVIOUS
                            DEFENSE OF SOUTH AFRICA, LEAVING U.S. IN VERY EXPOSED POSITION. ON OTHER
                            HAND IT NOT IN U.S. INTEREST TO SUPPORT EXTREME GA FORMULATIONS WHICH WE
                            NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT IN SC. ONE SUCH TYPE OF ACTION IS EXPULSION FROM
                            UN OF STATES WITH WHOSE ACTIONS MAJORITY DISAGREES. END FYI.</p>
                        <p>6. EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION OF SOUTH AFRICA. WE BELIEVE THAT ACQUIESCENCE
                            IN EXCLUSION OF SOUTH AFRICA FROM GA COULD PROVE DAMAGING TO US. IT
                            COULD ALSO PREJUDICE OUR POSITION IN THE SC, SHOULD AFRICANS BRING
                            MATTER TO COUNCIL. AS ALREADY INDICATED, SOUTH AFRICA'S EXCLUSION WOULD
                            ESTABLISH PRECEDENT OF ACTING AGAINST (AS OPPOSED TO CONDEMNING) ISRAEL
                            OR ANY OTHER UNPOPULAR NATION BECAUSE OF DISAGREEMENT WITH ITS INTERNAL
                            OR EXTERNAL POLICIES. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THERE IS
                            BENEFIT IN KEEPING SOUTH AFRICA EXPOSED TO CRITICISM TO ITS POLICIES AND
                            HELD RESPONSIBLE IN ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WITHIN
                            SOUTH AFRICA. IF NOT REPRESENTED IN ASSEMBLY, SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT
                            WOULD BE ABLE MORE EASILY TO DISREGARD INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION.</p>
                        <p>7. WE WISH TO KNOW LONDON'S, PARIS' AND BONN'S VIEWS SOONEST OF HOW THEY
                            WOULD PLAN TO HANDLE SUCH CHALLENGES TO SOUTH AFRICA IN NEXT GA, BOTH
                            POLITICALLY AND LEGALLY. (USUN SIMILARLY SHOULD DISCUSS MATTER WITH
                            BRITISH, FRENCH AND GERMAN DELEGATIONS.) YOU SHOULD ASK WHETHER BRITISH,
                            FRENCH GERMANS CONCUR WITH OUR APPRAISAL THAT AFRICANS SERIOUSLY INTEND
                            TO ACT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA EARLY IN GA SESSION. IF SO, QUESTIONS WHICH
                            OCCUR TO US INCLUDE: DO THEY SEE HOW WE MIGHT DISSUADE AFRICANS FROM
                            SEEKING EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION OF SOUTH AFRICA? WOULD SUCH APPROACHES TO
                            AFS BE PRODUCTIVE EITHER IN DISSUADING THE AFRICANS OR, WOULD IT SERVE
                            TO REDUCE POSSIBLE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS? WHAT COUNTRIES MIGHT BE
                            USEFULLY APPROACHED? ARE AFRICANS LIKELY TO CONFINE ACTION TO GA OR WILL
                            THEY AS RECENT RUMORS INDICATE, RAISE MATTER IN SC? WE WOULD
                            PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE RECEIVING FRENCH ESTIMATE ON HOW BOUTEFLIKA
                            LIKELY TO ACT ON SOUTH AFRICAN QUESTION AS GA PRESIDENT AND HOW OPEN HE
                            WOULD BE TO ARGUMENTS IN <gloss target="#t_Para1">PARA</gloss> 6 AGAINST
                            TRYING TO FORCE SOUTH AFRICA OUT OF UN.</p>
                        <p>8. SHOULD BRITISH, FRENCH, GERMANS AGREE WITH US THAT ATTEMPT TO EXCLUDE
                            OR EXPEL SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BE DAMAGING TO WESTERN INTERESTS AND UN, YOU
                            SHOULD DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WILLING ACTIVELY TRY TO PREVENT SUCH MOVE,
                            AND IF SO, HOW AND WHETHER THEY BELIEVE WE SHOULD ACT IN CONCERT. WE
                            HAVE NOT MADE UP OUR MINDS ON PRECISE TACTICS TO FOLLOW. <persName

                        <p>ONE OF PERSISTENT DRAWBACKS TO PRG'S QUEST FOR INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY
                            HAS BEEN NOTABLE LACK OF SUPPORT FROM SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS. TO DATE
                            NO NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIA STATE HAS RECOGNIZED PRG. (BANGLADESH
                            EXTENDED RECOGNITION TO PRG MARCH, 1973 BUT TECHNICALLY IT IS REGARDED
                            AS SOUTH ASIAN STATE.) DRV/PRG WILL TRY TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION,
                            FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON LAOS, AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA. WHILE IT DOES NOT
                            SEEM LIKELY THAT ANY OF THESE COUNTRIES WILL RECOGNIZE PRG IN
                            FORESEEABLE FUTURE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT ONE OR ALL COULD BE PERSUADED
                            TO ADOPT A FRIENDLIER ATTITUDE TOWARDS PRG IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON
                            VIET-NAM AND IN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES. MOST LIKELY PROSPECT FOR
                            EARLY DRV/PRG GAIN IN REGION IS CAMBODIA WHERE COMMUNIST INSURGENT

                            GOVERNMENT AT UN 29TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER. IN
                            ADDITION TO IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DRV/PRG WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS JAPAN TO
                            LEND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT TO PRG BUT GOJ SHOWS NO SIGNS OF YIELDING TO
                            SUCH PRESSURE. IN CONTRAST PRG REPRESENTATIONS TO INDIA SEEM TO BE

                            ENCOURAGE MORE FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD PRG. PROSPECT OF SECURING

                            FUTURE APPEARS TO BE UNLIKELY. HOWEVER, DRV/PRG MAY POSSIBLY SUCCEED IN
                            OBTAINING WHAT THEY VIEW AS ENHANCED STATUS FOR PRG REPRESENTATION IN
                            ONE OR TWO CAPITALS SUCH AS RECENT "NAME CHANGE" OF PRG INFORMATION

                            SHOULD, WITHIN LIMITS OF ITS RESOURCES, ASSUME LARGER BURDEN OF

                        <p>August 23, 1974</p>
                        <p>PROBABLE IMPACT OF A UN VOTE TO UNSEAT THE GKR</p>
                        <p>PRECIS</p>
                        <p>--The Cambodian Government (GKR) runs a substantial risk of being
                            unseated at this fall's UN General Assembly and would certainly lose if
                            the question came to a vote now. A major effort is being made to reverse
                            the situation before the vote does take place in the fall, but it is
                            impossible to predict the outcome.</p>
                        <p>--The key factor in gauging the short-term impact of a negative vote
                            would be its effect on US backing of the GKR.</p>
                        <p>--The GKR cannot survive without US material assistance and the constant
                            direction and prodding provided by the US Mission.</p>
                        <p>--Following a negative UN vote, a rapid deterioration of GKR morale and
                            effectiveness would occur unless strong assurances of continued US
                            support were made.</p>
                        <p>--If US support were drastically curtailed or suspended by Congress
                            following a negative vote in the UN, the GKR would collapse in a few
                            weeks or months at most.</p>
                        <p>--If US aid were maintained, the GKR would probably survive through at
                            least another dry season, and perhaps for a considerable period
                            beyond.</p>
                        <p>--Even assuming the continuation of US support, a defeat at the UN would
                            over the longer run cast new doubts on the survivability of the GKR.</p>
                        <p>--The Khmer Communists (<gloss target="#t_KC1">KC</gloss>) will to
                            persist would be stiffened.</p>
                        <p>--The KC would be encouraged to further freeze <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>--the only non-Communist leader
                            within <gloss target="#t_GRUNK1">GRUNK</gloss> with enough stature to
                            challenge the power of the KC in a post-settlement government--out of a
                            position of real influence in the insurgency.</p>
                        <p>--A genuine compromise settlement would be placed even further out of
                            reach than it is now.</p>

                        <p>1. AS PREPARATIONS FOR THE 29TH UNGA GO FORWARD, I AM DISTRESSED TO LEARN
                            THAT IT IS THE ESTIMATE OF THE DEPARTMENT AND OF THE INTELLIGENCE
                            COMMUNITY THAT SUPPORTERS OF THE KHMER INSURGENT REGIME, NOMINALLY LED
                            BY PRINCE <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">SIHANOUK</persName>, STAND AN
                            EXCELLENT CHANCE OF OBTAINING ENOUGH VOTES TO UNSEAT THE LEGITIMATE
                            GOVERNMENT OF THE KHMER REPUBLIC.</p>
                        <p>2. I WISH TO AFFIRM TO YOU MY STRONG AND PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS
                            MATTER, NOT ONLY BECAUSE EJECTION OF THE <gloss target="#t_GKR1"
                                >GKR</gloss> FROM THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> WOULD HAVE
                            AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN INDOCHINA BUT
                            BECAUSE OF ITS IMPLICATIONS AS A PRECEDENT FOR THE UN AS AN INSTITUTION.
                            ALTHOUGH YOUR MISSION HAS BEEN ASKED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS TO
                            INTERVENE ACTIVELY WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT TO SEEK SUPPORT AND
                            UNDERSTANDING FOR THE US POSITION ON THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE, I WISH TO TAKE
                            THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STRESS AGAIN THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH I REGARD
                            THIS MATTER.</p>
                        <p>3. AS I RECENTLY TOLD THE CONGRESS, THERE ARE TWO BASIC THEMES IN OUR
                            POLICY TOWARD INDOCHINA. THE FIRST IS OUR BELIEF THAT A SECURE PEACE
                            THERE IS IMPORTANT TO OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE A WORLDWIDE STRUCTURE OF
                            PEACE. AT THE SAME TIME, WE BELIEVE THAT AN EVOLUTION TOWARDS PEACE IN
                            OTHER TROUBLED AREAS HELPS BRING ABOUT STABILITY FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
                            WORKING FOR SO LONG IN INDOCHINA. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR POLICY IN INDOCHINA,
                            IN GENERAL AND CAMBODIA IN PARTICULAR, HAS BEEN GEARED TO BRING ABOUT
                            CONDITIONS WHICH WILL BRING THE CONTENDING PARTIES TO THE CONFERENCE
                            TABLE. THEREFORE, A COROLLARY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THE SECOND
                            THEME OF OUR POLICY, HAS BEEN THE FRUSTRATION OF A FORCIBLE CONQUEST OF
                            THE COUNTRIES OF INDOCHINA. AGAIN, AS I TOLD THE CONGRESS, FORCIBLE
                            CONQUEST IS NOT ONLY REPUGNANT TO AMERICAN TRADITIONS BUT DESTABILIZING
                            IN THIS INTERDEPENDENT WORLD BECAUSE THE EFFORTS ARE FELT FAR BEYOND THE
                            AREA DIRECTLY THREATENED.</p>
                        <p>4. WE WANT HOST GOVERNMENTS CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE US FAVORS NO
                            PARTICULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT OR SOCIAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRIES OF
                            INDOCHINA. HOWEVER, WE DO INSIST ON A FREE CHOICE FOR THE PEOPLE OF
                            THOSE COUNTRIES, AS THE DECISIONS OF FIVE PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST 25
                            YEARS INDICATE. FOR THIS, AMERICA HAS SOUGHT NO PLAUDITS AND HAS IN FACT
                            SUFFERED UNJUST CRITICISM. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE, NEVERTHELESS, THAT IT IS
                            IN THE INTEREST OF ALL NATIONS, WITHOUT COMMENTARY ON THE MERITS OF
                            EITHER SIDE'S CLAIMS, TO SUPPORT A CESSATION OF COMBAT IN THE AREA.</p>
                        <p>5. WE BELIEVE THAT ACQUIESCENCE IN THE CLAIMS OF THE CAMBODIAN INSURGENT
                            REGIME TO THE KHMER SEAT IN THE UNITED NATIONS WOULD NOT, AS SOME WOULD
                            LIKE TO BELIEVE, RESOLVE THE ISSUE ONCE AND FOR ALL. RATHER, WE BELIEVE
                            IT WOULD FURTHER EMBITTER THE CONFRONTATION BY ENCOURAGING THE KHMER
                            ROUGE TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO BRING DOWN THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT BY ALL
                            MEANS.</p>
                        <p>6. THE KHMER PEOPLE AND ARMED FORCES, DESPITE DIREST PREDICTIONS BY
                            OUTSIDE OBSERVERS AND AWESOME INTERNAL PROBLEMS, HAVE SURVIVED THE
                            ONSLAUGHT OF COMBAT-TRAINED NORTH VIETNAMESE DIVISIONS, PLUS THE ATTACKS
                            OF KHMER COMMUNIST TROOPS LED BY NORTH VIETNAMESE-TRAINED CAMBODIAN
                            COMMUNIST CADRE. THE VERDICT IS QUITE CLEAR AFTER FOUR YEARS OF WAR AND
                            SUFFERING IN A SMALL AND PEACEFUL NATION--AND MAJOR OFFENSIVE
                            EFFORTS--THE KHMER COMMUNISTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR OBJECTIVES.</p>
                        <p>7. NEVERTHELESS, WHILE WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE COMMUNISTS CANNOT TOPPLE
                            THE GOVERNMENT BY FORCE, THEY DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THE
                            CONFLICT, IN SIHANOUK'S WORDS, FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE OF INCONCLUSIVE
                            KILLING AND DESTRUCTION.</p>
                        <p>8. THE LEGITIMATE KHMER GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED UNCONDITIONAL
                            NEGOTIATIONS WITH ITS OPPONENTS. WE SUPPORT AND COMMEND THIS MOVE. WE
                            WOULD HOPE THAT THE UN AS A BODY WOULD ALSO SUPPORT NEGOTIATIONS RATHER
                            THAN PREJUDGING THE ISSUE BY TAKING THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF EJECTING A
                            NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN GOOD STANDING AND REPLACING IT WITH AN INSURGENT
                            REGIME. MOREOVER, THIS IS A REGIME THAT HAS NONE OF THE TRADITIONAL
                            CLAIMS TO AUTHORITY, SUCH AS EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER THE APPARATUS OF
                            GOVERNMENT, THE CAPITAL OR THE POPULATION AND WHOSE LEADERS NOT ONLY
                            PROMISE MASSACRE BUT WHO HAVE BEEN TRUE TO THEIR WORD.</p>
                        <p>9. IF THE MEMBERS OF THE UN VOTE TO ADMIT THE CAMBODIAN INSURGENT REGIME,
                            IT WILL, WE BELIEVE, DAMAGE THE CENTURIES-OLD EFFORT TO DEVELOP A CODE
                            OF INTERNATIONAL COMITY AMONG NATIONS BY MOVING AWAY FROM ACCEPTED
                            STANDARDS OF LEGITIMACY AND SUBSTITUTING IN ITS PLACE AN INSURGENT AND
                            ILLEGAL REGIME. OTHER NATIONS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO SUCH AN ATTACK ONCE
                            THE UN SHOWS ITS WILLINGNESS TO ADMIT SUCH A REGIME.</p>
                        <p>10. I WANT CHIEFS OF MISSION TO BE AWARE OF THESE COMMENTS AND THE
                            TALKING POINTS WHICH WILL BE SENT BY <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1"
                                >SEPTEL</gloss>, AND TO TAKE THE NEXT APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO
                            IMPRESS UPON THE HOST GOVERNMENT AT HIGHEST APPROPRIATE LEVEL OUR STRONG
                            FEELINGS THAT NO ONE SHOULD VOTE TO EXCLUDE A DELEGATION IN GOOD
                            STANDING FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, BUT RATHER THEY SHOULD SUPPORT A
                            CONSTRUCTIVE RESOLUTION, BROUGHT FORWARD BY SUPPORTERS OF THE GKR, WHICH
                            COULD LEAD TO PEACE, OR AT LEAST DEFERRAL OF THE ISSUE.</p>
                        <p>11. US REPRESENTATIVES WILL CONSULT INTENSIVELY WITH OTHER FRIENDLY
                            GOVERNMENTS IN NEW YORK IN AN EFFORT TO AGREE ON A SUITABLE SOLUTION. WE
                            WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED OF THESE EFFORTS AS THE SITUATION DEVELOPS.</p>
                        <p>12. FOR LISBON, OSLO AND VIENNA. GIVEN EARLIER ASSESSMENTS OF HOST
                            GOVERNMENT POSITIONS ON THE KHMER REPRESENTATION ISSUE AND RECENT
                            DEVELOPMENTS, WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT ATTITUDES WITH
                            PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO POSSIBLE SPECIAL ACTIONS OR APPROACH THAT MIGHT
                            BE MADE AT HIGH LEVEL TO INSURE SUPPORT FOR GKR.</p>
                        <p>13. FOR ADDIS ABABA, ABIDJAN, ACCRA, AMMAN, BANGUI, BUENOS AIRES,

                        <p>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MG8">Meany</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter of September 9 to the Secretary advising that
                            the <gloss target="#t_AFLCIO1">AFL–CIO</gloss> would be strongly opposed
                            to the admission of the Palestine Liberation Organization to observer or
                            any other status in the United Nations, the <gloss target="#t_ILO1"
                                >ILO</gloss>, or any other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agency.
                            I reply in the absence of the Secretary who is in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, the Arab members of the United Nations have undertaken
                            a carefully orchestrated campaign to obtain international recognition
                            for the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> by securing its
                            participation, as an observer, in the meetings of organizations within
                            the UN system. The Arabs have also agreed to work for an invitation to
                            the PLO to appear in the UN General Assembly later this fall when the
                            Palestinian item is debated there.</p>
                        <p>So far, the PLO has by strong majorities obtained observer status in the
                            Universal Postal Union, the International Telecommunications Union, and
                            the World Health Organization. Furthermore, the executive bodies of both
                                <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> and the International
                            Civil Aviation Organization have just approved recommendations that
                            their general meetings, both currently in session, invite the PLO to
                            attend as an observer.</p>
                        <p>Our position on this question is and has been that we are opposed to, and
                            have voted against, any direct invitation to the PLO to participate as
                            an observer in meetings of UN specialized agencies. We have also opposed
                            any such invitation, however tendered, which specifically names the PLO.
                            In order to forestall the adoption of more undesirable formulae we have
                            not opposed resolutions which permit the attendance as observers at
                            international meetings of representatives of groups recognized by
                            regional intergovernmental organizations such as the Organization of
                            African Unity and the League of Arab States, the latter of which
                            recognizes the PLO.</p>
                        <p>As a result of current instructions based on this policy, our delegation
                            to the recent UNESCO Executive Board Meeting voted against a resolution
                            recommending that the UNESCO General Conference extend a direct
                            invitation to the PLO. Furthermore, particularly because of the
                            involvement of constituent units of the PLO in air piracy, our
                            delegation to <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> voted for an Israeli
                            motion opposing a formula which would have allowed the PLO to
                            participate in a regional ICAO meeting.</p>
                        <p>We expect that the UN General Assembly's decision on the question of PLO
                            attendance there will already have been reached by the time the ILO
                            Governing Body convenes on November 12. That decision is therefore
                            central to our strategy at the ILO Governing Body. However, we have
                            already instructed our mission in Geneva to inform the Director General
                            of ILO of the <gloss target="#t_AFLCIO1">AFL–CIO</gloss>'s views on this
                            question, as communicated in your letter, and to support those views
                            with an expression of the firm belief of the United States that there is
                            no basis for according observer status in the ILO to the PLO as long as
                            it is requested in its own name rather than under the formula described
                            above which calls for sponsorship by regional intergovernmental
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also has kept, and will keep, the contents of your letter
                            very much in mind in his recent and current discussions with Israeli and
                            Arab leaders. In these discussions, he has had, however, to confront the
                            hard fact that the PLO's Arab and other sponsors have the votes to
                            achieve their purpose. His efforts, therefore, have been directed to
                            ensuring that the actions taken concerning the PLO in bodies within the
                            UN system and above all in the General Assembly, do not endanger the
                            process of peacemaking in the Middle East which is of paramount concern
                            to all of us.</p>

                            UN</p>
                        <p>1. ACTION ADDRESSEES ARE REQUESTED TO TRANSMIT FOLLOWING LETTER FROM
                            SECRETARY TO MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:</p>
                        <p>BEGIN QTE</p>
                        <p>DEAR MR. MINISTER,</p>
                        <p>NOW THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL, AT THE REQUEST OF THE AFRICAN GROUP, IS
                            BEGINNING TO DISCUSS SOUTH AFRICA'S RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS,
                            CLOSE CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE
                            TO EMERGE WITH DECISIONS THAT WILL ENHANCE RATHER THAN DAMAGE THE FUTURE
                            OF THE UNITED NATIONS. THE UNITED STATES SHARES WITH PERU AND IN FACT
                            ALMOST EVERY GOVERNMENT ON THIS GLOBE A STRONG REVULSION AGAINST THE
                            RACIAL POLICIES OF SOUTH AFRICA. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT CHANGES IN
                            SOUTH AFRICAN RACIAL POLICIES WILL COME ABOUT MORE RAPIDLY IF THAT
                            GOVERNMENT IS PRESENT IN THE COUNCILS OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND SUBJECT
                            TO THE FULL FORCE OF WORLD OPINION THERE.</p>
                        <p>EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTAL ARE THE PRINCIPLES AT STAKE IN THE COUNCIL'S
                            DELIBERATIONS. THEY ARE, IN OUR VIEW, THE OVERRIDING DESIRABILITY OF
                            MAINTAINING THE WORLDWIDE CHARACTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND,
                            CONVERSELY, THE DANGER OF ESTABLISHING THE PRECEDENT OF DEPRIVING ANY
                            MEMBER STATE OF ITS MEMBERSHIP OR ITS RIGHTS IN THE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE
                            ITS POLICIES MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF WIDESPREAD DISAPPROVAL.</p>
                        <p>I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF (PERU) SHARE
                            THESE CONCERNS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT OUR DELEGATIONS IN NEW YORK, ALONG
                            WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED DELEGATIONS, CAN TAKE COMMON POSITIONS IN THE
                            COUNCIL'S DELIBERATIONS. I AM WRITING YOU IN THE SPIRIT OF MUTUAL
                            INTEREST AND CLOSE COOPERATION WHICH INCREASINGLY ANIMATES THE RELATIONS
                            BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND (PERU) IN SO MANY FIELDS OF ACTION.</p>

                            ADOPTED RESOLUTION CALLING ON SECURITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW RELATIONSHIP
                            BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND UN. AFRICAN GROUP HAS REQUESTED COUNCIL TO TAKE
                            UP MATTER ON OCTOBER 18, AND THERE IS STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL
                            PROPOSE RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING SOUTH AFRICA'S EXPULSION OR SUSPENSION.
                            UNDER CHARTER ARTICLES 5 AND 6, <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> MAY
                            EXPEL OR SUSPEND MEMBER UPON RECOMMENDATION OF <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> FOR VIOLATION OF CHARTER PRINCIPLES. THE AFRICANS WOULD
                            BE LIKELY TO JUSTIFY A RECOMMENDATION OF SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION ON
                            GROUNDS THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS VIOLATED CHARTER PRINCIPLES BY ITS
                            DOMESTIC RACIAL POLICIES, BY REFUSAL TO HEED SC'S CALL TO WITHDRAW FROM
                            NAMIBIA, OR BY ITS MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO RHODESIA.</p>
                        <p>3. US IS AWARE OF AND DEPLORES SOUTH AFRICA'S TRANSGRESSIONS. WE,
                            NONETHELESS, DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO REMOVE SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM THE UN EITHER BY SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION. REMOVAL OF SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM UN WOULD ELIMINATE WHATEVER MODERATING INFLUENCE ORGANIZATION HAS
                            ON SOUTH AFRICA'S POLICIES. MOREOVER, IT WOULD SET EXAMPLE FOR SIMILAR
                            ACTION AGAINST OTHER MEMBERS, SUCH AS ISRAEL, WHOSE POLICIES MAY AT A
                            GIVEN TIME BE OBJECTIONABLE TO MAJORITY OF UN MEMBERSHIP. FINALLY, WE
                            OPPOSE EXPULSION OR SUSPENSION, WHICH HAS SAME PRACTICAL EFFECT, ON
                            GROUNDS THAT IT WOULD DETRACT FROM ORGANIZATION'S WORLDWIDE
                            CHARACTER.</p>
                        <p>4. ABSTENTIONS BY SEVEN OF FIFTEEN SC MEMBERS WOULD DEFEAT EXPULSION OR
                            SUSPENSION RESOLUTION. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> AND FRANCE HAVE
                            INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD ABSTAIN ON EXPULSION. WE BELIEVE UK WOULD
                            ABSTAIN ON SUSPENSION BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW FRANCE WOULD VOTE. WE
                            BELIEVE THAT OF SC MEMBERS ONLY AUSTRIA, AUSTRALIA, PERU, COSTA RICA AND
                            POSSIBLY INDONESIA MIGHT JOIN THREE PERMANENT MEMBERS IN ABSTAINING AND
                            THUS DEFEATING SOUTH AFRICA'S EXPULSION; WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULD
                            VOTE ON SUSPENSION. DEFEAT OF EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION RESOLUTIONS BY
                            ABSTENTION WOULD AVOID NEED TO CONSIDER USING US VETO, MOVE WHICH WOULD
                            HAVE DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES TO POLITICAL AND PERHAPS ALSO TO ECONOMIC
                            INTERESTS OF U.S. THERE ALSO POSSIBILITY AFRICANS MIGHT NOT PROPOSE
                            EXPULSION OR SUSPENSION RESOLUTIONS IF THEY BECAME AWARE SEVEN COUNCIL
                            MEMBERS WILLING TO ABSTAIN AND PREVENT ADOPTION OF SUCH RESOLUTION. WE
                            THEREFORE WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO OBTAIN SUPPORT OF AUSTRIA, AUSTRALIA,
                            COSTA RICA, PERU, AND INDONESIA IN PREVENTING ADOPTION OF SUCH
                            RESOLUTIONS.</p>
                        <p>5. LIMA MAY USE FOREIGN MINISTER'S FIRST NAME IN SALUTATION. OTHER ACTION
                            ADDRESSEES SHOULD ADDRESS LETTERS "DEAR MR. MINISTER.'</p>
                        <p>6. CHIEF OF MISSION SHOULD SUPPLEMENT LETTERS BY ORAL PRESENTATION. HE
                            SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ABSTENTION WOULD GIVE WITNESS TO DISAPPROVAL OF
                            APARTHEID WHILE PREVENTING VERY UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE OF EXPELLING OR
                            SUSPENDING UN MEMBER. EXPULSION OR SUSPENSION OF SOUTH AFRICA WOULD TEND
                            TO ENCOURAGE SIMILAR ACTION AGAINST OTHER MEMBER STATES WHICH MIGHT AT
                            ONE TIME OR ANOTHER INCUR DISAPPROVAL OF UN MEMBERS. SOUTH AFRICAN
                            GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SOME COSMETIC CHANGES. NEW GEOPOLITICAL SITUATION IN
                            SOUTHERN AFRICA RESULTING FROM INSTALLATION OF <gloss
                                target="#t_FRELIMO1">FRELIMO</gloss> GOVERNMENT IN MOZAMBIQUE AND
                            EVENTUAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA WILL HAVE MAJOR IMPACT ON SOUTH AFRICA.
                            US BELIEVES THAT UN CAN AND SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
                            TO PUT RENEWED PRESSURE ON SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL
                            CHANGES IN ITS RACIAL POLICIES. HOWEVER FOR UN TO HAVE INFLUENCE, SOUTH
                            AFRICA SHOULD NOT BE EXPELLED OR EVEN SUSPENDED, AS IT IMPORTANT SOUTH
                            AFRICA BE PRESENT IN UN IN ORDER TO FEEL FULL WEIGHT OF WORLD OPPROBRIUM
                            AND IN ORDER TO LEAVE OPEN POSSIBILITY OF UN PLAYING ROLE IN NEGOTIATING
                            CHANGE. WE HOPE THAT HOST GOVERNMENT WILL AGREE WITH US VIEWS AND
                            ABSTAIN ON ANY RESOLUTION TO EXPEL OR SUSPEND SOUTH AFRICA.</p>

                        <p>1. PRELIMINARY REACTIONS ESPECIALLY AMONG AFRICAN MEMBERS OF THE UN, TO
                            US EXERCISE OF VETO, HAVE BEEN WITHOUT DISCERNIBLE PATTERNS AND WITHOUT
                            PARTICULARLY STRONG CRITICISM. SEVERAL DELEGATIONS, TO OUR SURPRISE IN
                            SOME CASES, HAVE CONGRATULATED US ON STATEMENT MADE BY AMB. <persName

                            WE VOTED. VERY FEW HAVE LAMBASTED US. RUNDOWN OF CERTAIN REACTIONS BY
                            COUNTRY MAY BE OF SOME INTEREST: CAMEROON-MISOFF NDIMBIE TOLD US THAT HE
                            UNDERSTOOD OUR VOTE, THAT WE HAD TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FROM WASHINGTON,
                            AND THAT CERTAIN ELEMENTS THERE WERE SYMPATHETIC TO SOUTH AFRICA. (WE
                            TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.) ALGERIAN (OUCIF-THERE COLONIAL ISSUES
                            MAN), CHAD (ALLINGUE <gloss target="#t_PermRep1">PERMREP</gloss>, AND
                            ETHIOPIA (ACTING PERMREP TADESSE) WERE CORDIAL AS ALWAYS, AND MADE NO
                            COMMENT CONCERNING THE VOTE. NIGERIA - COUNSELLOR YERO SAID SIMPLY, "WE
                            HAVE NOTED YOUR VETO". MALI - PERMREP TRAORE SAID," WE KNOW IT WAS A
                            DIFFICULT VOTE," BUT THAT HE UNDERSTOOD OUR POSITION. VISITING MEMBER OF
                            MALIAN MILITARY COMMITTEE, FILIFING SISSOKO, MADE NO COMMENT. UPPER

                            MAN DESCRIBED IT AS "OVERKILL". LESOTHO - PERM REP MOLAPO MADE NO

                            TO VETO. MALAWI - PERMREP MBAYA MADE NO COMMENT ON VETO, BUT WAS ANXIOUS
                            TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOW UP STEPS US, UK AND FRANCE INTEND TO MAKE WITH

                            HAD BEEN VIOLENT IN HIS CRITICISM DURING DEBATE, ALSO CONGRATULATED AMB.

                        <p>2. REACTIONS OF SOME EUROPEAN AND OTHER NON-AFRICAN MEMBERS ALSO ARE
                            INTERESTING. THE FRENCH ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE RESULTS OF
                            THEIR VETO. SPECIFICALLY, THEY FEAR THAT AFRICANS MAY SWING FULL SUPPORT
                            BEHIND AUSTRALIAN RES IN FIRST COMMITTEE, CRITICIZING PACIFIC TESTING.
                            AUSTRIAN REP LENNKH POINTED OUT THAT THE VOTE SHOWED THAT AUSTRIA DOES
                            NOT ALWAYS SIMPLY VOTE WITH MAJORITY: RATHER IT "SOMETIMES VOTES ON
                            PRINCIPLE". AT HIS MID-DAY BRIEFING OCT 31, UK SPOKESMAN SAID VETOED RES
                            "DOES NOT RESOLVE ANYTHING". CENTRAL QUESTION WAS NOT EXPULSION BUT
                            POLICIES CONCERNING NAMIBIA, SOUTHERN RHODESIA AND APARTHEID. ENTIRE UN
                            HAS OBLIGATION TO INFLUENCE CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA. HE ADDED THAT UK,
                            FRANCE, AND US HAD CONSULTED ON VETO, BUT THAT THERE WAS NO "VOTING
                            PACT". INDIAN MISOFF AHMAD WAS DISAPPOINTED, AND SAID VETO COULD HAVE
                            BEEN AVOIDED HAD BOTH SIDES WORKED HARDER. HE BELIEVES SOME AFRICANS
                            FEEL US SHOULD HAVE EXERTED MORE PRESSURE ON UK AND FRANCE TO COME
                            AROUND AND SUPPORT AFRICAN EFFORTS FOR COMPROMISE. </p>
                        <p>3. COMMENT: IN SUM, IT DOES NOT LOOK AS THOUGH THE SKY FELL IN. MOST
                            AFRICANS ARE NOW LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO TURN TO EFFECT CHANGE IN SOUTH
                            AFRICA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTHERN RHODESIA. ALMOST ALL ASK FOR US, UK AND
                            FRENCH PRESSURE ON SAG. MANY UNDERSTAND OUR VETO EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT
                            SAY SO PUBLICLY. AT THIS JUNCTURE, VOTE LOSS FOR US ON OTHER ISSUES
                            APPEARS ONLY MARGINAL, WERE INDIVIDUAL VOTERS TO BE LEFT TO THEIR OWN
                            DESIGNS. BUT, GIVEN STRONG FLOOR LEADERSHIP WITHIN AFRICAN GROUP AND
                            NON-ALIGNED, US VETO MAY BE EXPLOITED BY OTHERS TO BRING ALONG GROUP
                            VOTING ANTITHETICAL TO OUR INTERESTS. <lb/>

                            EXPELLED THE GKR FROM ITS UN SEAT AND GIVEN IT TO GRUNK; B) SECOND, IT
                            APPROVED THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION, AS AMENDED (SEE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH),
                            BY 56 TO 54 WITH 24 ABSTENTIONS AND THREE ABSENCES. FOLLOWING THE
                            FAVORABLE DECISION OF THE PLENARY, THE ONLY HURDLE NOW REMAINING FOR THE
                            GKR IS THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE DELIBERATION AND REPORT. THE MEETING OF
                            THE COMMITTEE HAS NOT YET BEEN SCHEDULED AND THEREFORE THE TIMING FOR
                            SUBMISSION OF ITS REPORT TO THE PLENARY IS NOT YET KNOWN.</p>
                        <p>4. THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE VOTING WAS IN GREAT PART DUE TO THE GOOD
                            ORGANIZATION, HARD WORK AND EFFECTIVE LOBBYING BY JAPAN AND THE <gloss

                            AL LESS PROMINENT SUPPORTIVE ROLE. THE GKR DELEGATION ALSO ACQUITTED
                            ITSELF WELL, WITH PRIME MINISTER LONG BORET, FOREIGN MINISTER KEUKY LIM
                            AND PERMREP CHHUT CHHOEUR BEING KEY FIGURES. THE FINAL VOTING BROUGHT
                            SOME UNPLEASANT SURPRISES, WITH COUNTRIES EXPECTED TO BE IN THE GKR CAMP
                            SUCH AS ECUADOR, GREECE AND PORTUGAL ABSTAINING. THESE DEFECTIONS,
                            HOWEVER, WERE MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCED BY FAVORABLE VOTES FROM A NUMBER
                            OF ARAB COUNTRIES INCLUDING MOROCCO AND TUNISIA, AND KEY ABSENCES BY
                            EGYPT AND GHANA.</p>

                            SPEECH DELIVERED IN A LOW VOICE WITHOUT APPARENT EMOTION, STATED THAT
                            THE PROLONGED STATIONING OF US TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA AND US INTERFERENCE
                            IN SOUTH KOREA ARE THE KEY OBSTACLES TO PEACE AND REUNIFICATION OF THE
                            KOREAN PEOPLE. HUANG HUA NOTED THAT THE KOREA DEBATE THIS YEAR PLAYED AN
                            IMPORTANT ROLE IN EDUCATING THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD AND IS AN IMPORTANT
                            VICTORY FOR THE KOREAN PEOPLE. HE REPEATED HIS ARGUMENTS THAT THE
                            FRIENDLY RES WAS DESIGNED BY THE US TO DELAY THE WITHDRAWAL OF US TROOPS
                            FROM SOUTH KOREA, TO PERPETUATE THE DIVISION OF KOREA INTO TWO PARTS,
                            AND TO REIMPOSE THE ILLEGAL SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS PASSED BEFORE
                            THE PRC TOOK ITS SEAT IN THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. HE

                            OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE IS UNSWERVING.</p>

                            SHRIFT TO THE KOREA ISSUE, DEVOTING MOST OF HIS SPEECH TO AN ATTACK ON

                            WOULD INFLICT PARTICULAR SUFFERING ON HE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. HE NOTED
                            THAT MANY THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES VOTED FOR THE FRIENDLY RES IN SPITE OF
                            CLAIMS BY CERTAIN BIG POWERS OF "TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY" MALIK
                            MENTIONEC COLOMBIA AND PHILIPPINES AS BEING IN THIS CATEGORY. HE LINKED
                            THE TWO ISSUES BY NOTING THAT MANY WHO VOTED AGAINST NORTH KOREA IN
                            FIRST COMMITTEE ARE IN FAVOR OF CHARTER REVIEW, AND DREW THE CONCLUSION
                            THAT SINCE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT ON THE
                            OBJECTIVITY OF SOME THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR
                            USSR TO MAINTAIN VETO POWER IN <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. HE
                            CONCLUDED BY STATING THAT THE USSR WOULD VOTE AGAINST "THE UNWARRANTED

                        <p>SUSPENSION OF ISRAEL FROM THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY</p>
                        <p>Since January 1975--and especially since the breakdown of the
                            step-by-step negotiations in March--the Arab states, led by Syria and
                            Algeria, have been pushing the idea of expelling Israel from the UN.
                            Because expulsion requires a prior recommendation by the Security
                            Council, the most likely Arab action, however, would be an attempt to
                            suspend Israel from participation in the UN General Assembly. The
                            prospects for the success of such a move--which are now estimated at
                            about even--will be greatly enhanced if </p>
                        <p>--no progress is made toward an Arab-Israeli settlement before
                            September;</p>
                        <p>--the full ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Countries (<gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>), which meets in Lima on August 25,
                            endorses a resolution to this effect; and</p>
                        <p>--the Arabs conduct an all-out campaign to isolate Israel in the UN and
                            in other international organizations.</p>
                        <p>Disagreement at Havana. The suspension of South Africa from participation
                            in the 29th <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> highlighted the
                            possibility of similar action against Israel at this year's Assembly. In
                            fact, a number of delegations tried to establish a parallel between
                            Israeli and South African policies, and during the debate on the
                            Palestine question, Syria and Iraq called for Israel's expulsion. Since
                            then the Syrians, backed by the Algerians, pursued the issue to the
                            point of submitting an expulsion proposal to the Foreign Ministers'
                            meeting of the 17-member Non-Aligned Coordinating Bureau in Havana,
                            March 17-19.</p>
                        <p>According to information provided to US officials by a Yugoslav UN
                            mission official, Syria insisted that the issue be addressed not only in
                            the Declaration of Havana but also in a separate resolution to be
                            transmitted to the NAC ministerial meeting in Lima in August.</p>
                        <p>Syria's proposed draft resolution (full text not available) had three
                            operative paragraphs:</p>
                        <p>--exclusion of Israel from the UN;</p>
                        <p>--annulment of the UNGA Resolution of 1949 which admitted Israel as a UN
                            member; and</p>
                        <p>--revision of Security Council Resolution 242.</p>
                        <p>These proposals represented difficulties, however, for a number of
                            delegations, particularly India's and Yugoslavia's, which successfully
                            prevented the resolution from being included among the official
                            documents to be forwarded to Lima. Instead, it was decided to forward
                            the resolution informally and to note in the Declaration that the
                            Coordinating Bureau supported in principle the ideas expressed in the
                            draft.</p>
                        <p>According to the Yugoslav official, the Declaration's wording provoked
                            much discussion. Syria and Algeria, backed by Cuba, Senegal, Tanzania,
                            and Kuwait, wanted to call for Israel's expulsion and for sanctions.
                            Instead, with Yugoslav support, a compromise formulation was worked out,
                            and the Declaration subsequently stated:</p>
                        <p>"The Bureau believes the time is ripe for the non-aligned countries to
                            consider broader measures against Israel, in compliance with the UN
                            Charter, including such measures as the implementation of sanctions, the
                            dismissal from the UN, etc."</p>
                        <p>The Bureau further recommended that the agenda for the Lima meeting
                            include an item on the "Palestine question."</p>
                        <p>Suspension Move Likely. The Yugoslavs maintain that the Declaration is
                            still in draft form and that two versions exist: one as cited above and
                            another calling for the "imposition of sanctions, other measures under
                            Chapter 7 [of the UN Charter], suspension or exclusion from the UN,
                            etc." The Yugoslavs say that they were responsible for adding the word
                            "suspension."</p>
                        <p>In view of Syria's reported request that Yugoslavia take the lead in
                            introducing an expulsion resolution, the Yugoslavs may be thinking of
                            following the South Africa precedent (suspension from participating in
                            the UN General Assembly activities) as the only action likely to
                            succeed. They well know that expulsion from the UN, suspension of the
                            exercise of the rights of UN membership, and imposition of political and
                            economic sanctions would require Security Council recommendation and
                            would be vetoed by the US, and possibly by the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and France, or would fail to get nine affirmative
                            votes.</p>
                        <p>Faced with the prospect of certain defeat in the Council, the Arabs will
                            direct their efforts to the UN General Assembly, where action does not
                            require Council recommendation. Such action will probably follow last
                            year's pattern under which South Africa was suspended from the 29th UN
                            General Assembly: that is, a successful challenge of Israel's
                            credentials. It may also take the form of a resolution charging Israel
                            with failing to observe UN resolutions and with flouting the UN
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>To complicate matters for the Israelis, there is a possibility that the
                            probable next President of the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Thorn
                            of Luxembourg, will not revive the Hambro ruling which <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAA1">Bouteflika</persName> reversed when he upheld the
                            Assembly's resolution suspending South Africa last year.* Also,
                            Bouteflika, as outgoing President, will select the members of the
                            Credentials Committee.</p>
                        <p>* Since 1970 the UNGA had voted annually to amend the Credential
                            Committee's report so as to reject South Africa's credentials. Each
                            year, however, beginning with Hambro, the UNGA President had ruled that
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> opposition constituted a strong
                            condemnation of, and a warning to, South Africa but that South Africa's
                            right to sit, vote, and participate in the Assembly was not
                            affected.</p>
                        <p>Although the NAC Group at the UN tends to split its vote on political
                            issues, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> estimates that a vote on a
                            resolution calling for Israel's suspension from the 30th UN General
                            Assembly would be extremely close. This assumes that Israel continues to
                            be regarded by most UN members as intransigent, and that the Arabs
                            conduct an all-out campaign to isolate it.</p>
                        <p>A suspension move in the UNGA would be greatly aided by endorsement of
                            such action by the NAC meeting in Lima.</p>
                        <p>Such endorsement would be virtually assured if the Egyptians and other
                            Arabs decide to give strong support to the Syrian-Algerian move.</p>
                        <p>The Arab Campaign. A campaign to expel Israel from international
                            organizations seemed to be taking shape last March. After the collapse
                            of the Secretary's mission to the Middle East, Egyptian Foreign Minister
                            Fahmi, in a speech to the Arab League Council in late March, urged
                            escalation of the campaign to "isolate and reject" Israel from the
                            international community, the UN, and other international organizations.
                            On March 25, the Egyptian Ambassador in Oslo, apparently on
                            instructions, told Norwegian Foreign Ministry officials that Egypt was
                            consulting its allies about possible diplomatic and economic sanctions
                            against Israel, including expulsion from the UN.</p>
                        <p>In recent weeks, however, the Egyptians have soft-pedaled their campaign
                            to isolate Israel. And, at the recent meetings of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> Executive Board and the World
                            Health Assembly, the Egyptians were cooperative in keeping extreme
                            anti-Israeli items off the agenda. The Israelis had been concerned that
                            the Arabs might move to suspend or expel them from these organizations,
                            particularly the <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, but such a move
                            was not made. The possibility of an anti-Israeli move at the <gloss
                                target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> General Conference (June 5-25) is
                            unlikely because no draft resolution on this subject was submitted two
                            weeks in advance as required. The major Middle East issue at the ILO
                            concerns <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> observer status.</p>
                        <p>Despite the above-noted cooperative attitude displayed by the Egyptians,
                            there is little doubt that the Arabs are keeping the
                            expulsion/suspension option open. While some African and other non-Arab
                            members of the NAC have reservations about the wisdom and effects of
                            such actions on US and Western public opinion, probably most will honor
                            their commitments to the Arab cause. Indeed, on May 27 Yugoslav
                            Ambassador Petric insisted to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJA1"
                                >Scali</persName> that Israel must take some conciliatory step
                            between now and the convening of the NAC meeting in August. Otherwise,
                            Petric strongly implied, the Lima meeting would recommend expulsion or
                            suspension of Israel from the UN, and Yugoslavia would have to go along
                            with it.</p>

                            VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>Hanoi and Saigon are withholding their applications for UN membership
                            until they can determine whether the US will veto them. Meanwhile, the
                            US has suggested that membership for the Vietnams be linked to admission
                            of both Koreas, and Seoul is pressing Washington to demand that
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi Changes lts Mind. Until recently, the position of Hanoi, which
                            first applied for UN membership in 1946, had been that national
                            reunification must be completed before entry into the UN. In late May,
                            however, representatives of both North and South Vietnam in Paris
                            appealed to Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_WK5"
                                >Waldheim</persName> to take soundings on the possibility of full UN
                            membership for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (Democratic
                            Republic of Vietnam) and the <gloss target="#t_PRGSV1">PRGSV</gloss>
                            (Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam). (The DRV and
                            the PRG are already members of the <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_WMO1">WMO</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>Vietnams for Koreas. Shortly thereafter, on May 27, Soviet Chargé
                                <persName corresp="#p_VYM1">Vorontsov</persName> informed Department
                            officials that he had been instructed to determine the US position
                            toward separate UN membership for both North and South Vietnam at the
                            30th UN General Assembly. He further told Department officials on June 3
                            that both the DRV and the PRG had consulted Moscow about membership on
                            that basis.</p>
                        <p>US officials suggested that the admission of both Vietnams might be
                            linked to the granting of membership to North and South Korea. Vorontsov
                            pointed to Pyongyang's strong opposition to membership for both Koreas
                            and argued against any linkage of the two questions.</p>
                        <p>In 1957, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at first advocated
                            simultaneous admission of both Vietnams and both Koreas, but it shifted
                            its position after North Vietnam contended in a letter to the
                            Secretary-General that admission of South Vietnam would be contrary to
                            the 1954 Geneva agreements. Thereafter, the USSR took the position that
                            Vietnam should not be admitted until after unification, but continued to
                            propose the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas. The last UN
                            consideration of these two admission questions was in 1958, when the
                            USSR again vetoed membership for South Korea and South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>On June 19, however, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official strongly implied
                            to a British Embassy official in Moscow that a trade-off might be
                            discussed whereby the USSR would support the admission of both Koreas,
                            if the US would not veto both Vietnams.</p>
                        <p>Soviet interests would not be affected adversely by the membership of
                            both Koreas in the UN. Moscow would have no objection in principle,
                            provided that the problem of North Korean objections could be resolved.
                            However, the Soviets, like the Chinese, would abide by North Korea's
                            decision, which remains one of adamant opposition.</p>
                        <p>North Vietnamese Approaches. The North Vietnamese have approached a
                            number of countries besides the Soviet Union in their efforts to
                            determine whether the US will veto their applications.</p>
                        <p>--The Japanese have told US officials that the DRV representative to the
                            Women's Conference in Mexico City had asked about the possibility of a
                            US veto.</p>
                        <p>--The Australians reported a similar inquiry.</p>
                        <p>The Italian Embassy in Hanoi disclosed that a North Vietnamese Foreign
                            Ministry official had said that Hanoi and Saigon have withheld
                            presentation of their requests for admission until they can ascertain
                            whether the US might use the veto.</p>
                        <p>US Position. To date, the US has never vetoed a membership application.
                            This practice has been consistent with the 1948 Vandenberg resolution
                            calling for voluntary agreement among the five permanent Security
                            Council members not to veto the admission of new UN members.</p>
                        <p>By publicly and formally tying its agreement to the Vietnamese
                            applications to the admission of both Koreas, or at least to South
                            Korea, the US would run the risk of being charged with violating an
                            International Court of Justice advisory opinion of May 28, 1948. That
                            opinion holds that a UN member is not juridically entitled</p>
                        <p>--to make its consent to admission of an applicant dependent on
                            conditions not expressly set forth in the UN Charter; and</p>
                        <p>--in particular, to subject its affirmative vote to the additional
                            condition that other states be admitted to UN membership at the same
                            time.</p>
                        <p>To avoid such a violation, the US is conveying to South Korea and others
                            its preference for a package deal in far less specific terms. Similar
                            package deals have been made before. For example, in 1955, long
                            negotiations outside the Security Council finally produced Soviet-US
                            agreement on the admission of Austria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Ireland,
                            Finland, Italy, Jordan, Laos, Libya, Nepal, Portugal, and Spain in
                            return for that of Albania, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In 1961,
                            lengthy negotiations led to Soviet-US agreement on the admission of
                            Mongolia in return for that of Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>Seoul's Insistence on Linkage. The South Korean Government immediately
                            saw the connection between Vietnamese membership and its own situation.
                            In 1973, Seoul reversed its policy and began to advocate membership in
                            the UN and other international organizations for both North and South
                            Korea. North Korea adamantly opposes this policy and insists that Korea
                            must be united, or at least confederated, before UN entry can take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>When informed of the US reply to the Soviets, the South Korean Foreign
                            Minister reacted very strongly to the absence of any US commitment to
                            link membership for the two Vietnams with that for the two Koreas. He
                            strongly urged a package deal as the "last opportunity" for his country
                            to become a UN member.</p>
                        <p>The South Koreans have already begun their own campaign to gain support
                            for linking the two issues. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Ambassador in Paris has told US officials that on instructions he made a
                            demarche to French Vice Foreign Minister De Courcel, who stated that
                            France</p>
                        <p>--supported admission for both North and South Korea; but</p>
                        <p>--could not oppose UN entry for South and North Vietnam as a precondition
                            because of the "special relationship" which France has with both
                            Vietnams.</p>
                        <p>Prospects. According to the UN Charter, membership in the UN "will be
                            affected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation
                            of the Security Council." The Charter also states that on such
                            substantive issues nine affirmative votes are necessary, including those
                            of the five permanent members. In practice, however, there is a
                            gentleman's agreement that a permanent member can abstain. The US record
                            of never having vetoed a membership application has been accomplished by
                            liberal resort to abstention.</p>
                        <p>On the question of membership for the two Vietnams, affirmative votes are
                            likely from the USSR, France, and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss>. The British told us on July 1 that they could not
                            oppose the Vietnamese applications for juridical reasons. Thus, a US
                            veto will be necessary to prevent the admission of Hanoi and Saigon.</p>

                            NEGATIVE SIDE. AMONG THE FEW POSITIVE RESULTS WERE THE EMASCULATION AND
                            NEUTRALIZATION OF A RESOLUTION WHICH ORIGINALLY GAVE HEAVY EMPHASIS TO
                            THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER AND A WHOLE SERIES OF OTHER
                            POLITICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE THIRD WORLD AND THE COMMUNIST STATE MEMBERS;

                        <p>1. SUMMARY. DURING CALL BY AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"
                                >MOYNIHAN</persName>, <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> DIRECTOR
                            GENERAL BLANCHARD SAID WITHDRAWAL OF US FROM ILO WOULD SERVE NEITHER US
                            NOR ISRAELI INTERESTS, THAT ILO WAS NOT DOMINATED BY NON-DEMOCRATIC
                            COUNTRIES AND THAT US SHOULD REMAIN IN ILO AND FIGHT TO MAINTAIN BASIC
                            PRINCIPLES OF ILO. BLANCHARD OFFERED TO SERVE AS MIDDLE-MAN IN HELPING
                            US MARSHAL FORCES OF INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND OF SYMPATHETIC LDCS.
                            HE AGREED WITH AMBASSADOR MOYNIHAN ON NEED TO APPLY ILO STANDARDS TO ALL
                            COUNTRIES, INCLUDING COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. AMBASSADOR MOYNIHAN OPENED CONVERSATION SAYING THAT FEELING IN US ON
                            ILO WAS RUNNING VERY HIGH AS RESULT OF ILO ACTION ON <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> AND THAT IT COULD WELL BE THAT US
                            WORKER OR EMPLOYER DELEGATIONS WILL NOT BE SEEN AT ILO AGAIN IN THIS
                            DECADE. HE ASKED BLANCHARD WHAT ADVICE HE COULD OFFER HIM IN CONNECTION
                            WITH UPCOMING CONSIDERATION BY US OF RELATIONSHIP TO ILO.</p>
                        <p>3. BLANCHARD MADE THREE MAJOR POINTS:</p>
                        <p>A. US WITHDRAWAL WOULD MEAN LOSS OF US INPUT INTO INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
                            MAKING AND WOULD BE CLEARLY AGAINST US ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS WELL AS A
                            DISADVANTAGE TO US SOCIAL POLICY INTERESTS;</p>
                        <p>B. US WITHDRAWAL FROM ILO WOULD NOT SERVE ISRAELI INTERESTS BUT WOULD
                            ENCOURAGE ARAB EXTREMISTS TO SEEK EXPULSION OF ISRAEL FROM ILO. SOME
                            MEMBERS OF ISRAELI DELEGATION TO ILO CONFERENCE DELEGATION HAVE TOLD HIM
                            THAT ISRAELI INTEREST WOULD NOT BE SERVED BY US WITHDRAWAL;</p>
                        <p>C. REAL ISSUE IN ILO WAS NOT ONE OF SOVIET DOMINATION (SEE <gloss
                                target="#t_Para1">PARA</gloss> 3, <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1"
                                >REFTEL</gloss>) BUT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES WHO BELIEVE IN
                            ILO AS LEGISLATOR OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS AND THOSE NATIONS WHO
                            WISH TO CHANGE NATURE OF ILO. HE OFFERED TO HELP MOBILIZE THE COUNTRIES
                            WHO BELIEVED IN ILO PRINCIPLES AND ALSO OFFERED HIS GOOD OFFICES TO
                            DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AFL-CIO AND <gloss
                                target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss> MEMBERS OF WORKERS GROUP. BLANCHARD
                            SAID UPCOMING WORLD EMPLOYMENT CONFERENCE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITY TO
                            PERSUADE LDCS OF VALUE OF TRIPARTISM AND ILO STANDARDS, AND HE DESCRIBED
                            HIS OWN EMPHASIS IN ILO PROGRAM ON WORKERS EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL
                            RELATIONS AT ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
                            IN LDCS.</p>
                        <p>4. AMBASSADOR MOYNIHAN SAID THAT DOUBLE STANDARD UNDER WHICH ONLY
                            SELECTED NATIONS WERE CITED FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN AND TRADE UNIONS
                            RIGHTS WAS "OBSCENE" AND IF DOUBLE STANDARD PERSISTED US COULD END UP
                            WITHDRAWING FROM UN SYSTEM. BLANCHARD SAID HE AGREED COMPLETELY WITH
                            MOYNIHAN'S POINT OF VIEW. MOYNIHAN ALSO URGED BLANCHARD TO MAKE STRONGER
                            CASE FOR US, PARTICULARLY WITH US LABOR MOVEMENT, FOR CONTINUED US
                            PARTICIPATION IN ILO; HE CONTRASTED ACTIVE ROLE OF EARLY ILO DIRECTOR
                            GENERALS AND US LABOR MOVEMENT IN SECURING US MEMBERSHIP IN THEN LARGELY
                            UNKNOWN ILO WITH UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO GET US TO JOIN PRESTIGIOUS
                            WORLD COURT. BLANCHARD SAID HE WAS READY TO GO TO WASHINGTON OR NEW YORK
                            AND WOULD RAISE QUESTION OF TIMING WITH SECRETARY DUNLOP. HE ALSO SAID
                            HE WOULD FURNISH WRITTEN STATEMENT OF HIS VIEWS TO MISSION IN NEXT FEW
                            DAYS. BLANCHARD ADDED THAT NOTICE OF US WITHDRAWAL FROM ILO AND CUTTING
                            OFF OF US FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ILO WERE BOTH GRAVE MEASURES WHICH
                            WOULD NOT ONLY CAUSE FINANCIAL HARM BUT COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS CHANGE
                            IN NATURE AND OPERATION OF ILO; HOWEVER, OF THE TWO ALTERNATIVES,
                            WITHDRAWAL OF US FINANCIAL SUPPORT WOULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE AND MORE
                            GRIEVOUS HARM BY FORCING CUTBACK IN PRESENT PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
                            THE WORD CONFERENCE ON EMPLOYMENT. </p>
                        <p>5. COMMENT: BLANCHARD IS CONVINCED THAT ILO RECORD ON PLO IS BEST IN UN
                            SYSTEM ("THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD ENTER IN A WEEK AND IT TOOK THIRTEEN
                            MONTHS") AND IS AMAZED THAT PLO ISSUE ("WHICH CONCEIVABLY COULD NOT BE
                            WITH US NEXT YEAR") WOULD PRECIPITATE US WITHDRAWAL FROM ILO.
                            SIGNIFICANCE FOR <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> AND FOR TRIPARTITE
                            GROUP NOW CONSIDERING US RELATIONSHIP TO ILO IS THAT BLANCHARD APPEARS
                            READY TO RESPOND TO US INITIATIVE; ESPECIALLY IN AREA OF APPLICATION OF
                            CONVENTIONS (WHERE 60TH CONFERENCE LET SOVIETS OFF SCOTT-FREE) AND IN
                            STRUCTURAL REFORM. HIS DEFENSIVENESS RE WORLD CONFERENCE ON EMPLOYMENT
                            ALSO SUGGESTS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CRANK IN ITS VIEWS ON AGENDA AND
                            STANDING ORDERS FOR THIS MEETING IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFERENCE BECOMING

                            BE MADE IN THE NEXT DAYS OR WEEKS, WILL IN EFFECT BE THE FIRST DECISION
                            OF THE THIRTIETH GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND OF THE SEVENTH SPECIAL SESSION. IT
                            WILL BE A FATEFUL ONE. ACCORDINGLY AS WE ACT, THE WORLD SYSTEM THE

                            PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER. A DETAILED, AND IF THE
                            SECRETARY SO DESIRES, AN EXCORIATING ACCOUNT OF THEIR PAST AND PRESENT
                            ACTIONS CAN BE PRESENTED FOR ALL THE WORLD TO WATCH. WE CAN THEN SAY
                            THAT WE ARE, HOWEVER, FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO PRINCIPLES--ON THE
                            ONE HAND THE ADHERENCE BY PARTICULAR COUNTRIES TO UNITED NATIONS
                            PRINCIPLES, ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF
                            MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNITED NATIONS ITSELF. THE TWO PRINCIPLES CONFLICT IN
                            THIS CASE, AND OF THE TWO THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS THE PRINCIPLE OF
                            UNIVERSALITY TO BE THE MORE IMPORTANT. ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE DECIDED TO
                            ABSTAIN ON THE RESOLUTION AND SO PERMIT THE ENTRY OF THESE TWO
                            NATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. ON THE SAME OCCASION THE UNITED STATES SHOULD REITERATE OUR
                            WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT FOR THE ADMISSION OF SOUTH KOREA, EITHER ALONE OR
                            WITH NORTH KOREA. WE COULD ALSO DEMAND OF OUR FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS
                            THAT AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AND OF PRACTICALITY THAT THEY ENABLE SOUTH
                            KOREA TO BE ADMITTED AS WELL. WHETHER WE SHOULD TABLE A RESOLUTION THEN
                            AND THERE IS A MATTER WE CAN DECIDE LATER. AS WASHINGTON KNOWS, THERE IS
                            PROBABLY NOT NOW A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF VOTES AVAILABLE EVEN TO GET THE
                            SOUTH KOREAN APPLICATION INSCRIBED ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA.</p>
                        <p>4. AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD MAKE AN
                            EXHAUSTIVE AND UNYIELDING STATEMENT IN DEFENSE OF THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS
                            FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY, WHICH IS THAT NATIONS ONCE ADMITTED
                            ARE NOT TO BE ARBITRARILY AND ILLEGALLY EXPELLED FROM THE GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY AND SUCH LIKE ORGANS. IN BOTH CASES WE ADDRESS OURSELVES TO A
                            CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION, AS THE SECRETARY STATED IN MILWAUKEE. WE WILL
                            HAVE THE OCCASION TO REMIND THE WORLD THAT THE UNITED NATIONS IS A
                            SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATION. THIS IS A WESTERN
                            PRINCIPLE, NO DOUBT. MOST MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS DO NOT
                            THEMSELVES HAVE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS. BUT IF THEY WANT A UNITED
                            NATIONS THEY WILL SIMPLY HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT PRINCIPLE IN THE WORLD
                            BODY. IF THEY DO NOT, THEN IT IS THEY WHO MUST BE SEEN TO BLAME.</p>
                        <p>5. WE WILL NOT GET SOUTH KOREA INTO THE UNITED NATIONS UNLESS THE NORTH
                            CHANGES ITS VIEW, BUT THIS AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE WILL DEMAND DAILY TO
                            KNOW WHY WE HAVE NOT, WHY THE COMMUNIST POWERS ONLY WANT OTHER COMMUNIST
                            POWERS AS MEMBERS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE THE INITIATIVE
                            WILL BE WITH US, AND UNMISTAKABLY BEST ARGUMENT WILL BE WITH US. WE WILL
                            MAKE CLEAR THAT AT THE VERY MINIMUM, HAVING DENIED KOREA MEMBERSHIP, THE
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST PROVIDE IT THE SECURITY OF AN ORDERLY TRANSFER OF
                            COMMAND: KOREA, OF ALL PLACES, IS THE ONE NATION THAT MUST BE THE
                            SPECIAL OBJECT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S CONCERN.</p>
                        <p>6. WE WILL HAMMER AT THIS THEME THROUGHOUT THE ASSEMBLY. THE UNITED
                            NATIONS NEEDS SEOUL. DAY AFTER DAY THE UNITED NATIONS COMMUNITY WILL BE
                            BROUGHT TO SEE THE RELATION OF THIS TO THE QUESTION OF ISRAELI
                            MEMBERSHIP. THE NON-ALIGNED WILL END UP WISHING THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF
                            VIETNAM, A SENTIMENT WHICH WOULD THEN INDEED APPROACH UNIVERSALITY.</p>
                        <p>7. THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO, OF COURSE, FOLLOWS FROM A VETO. I MUST
                            REPORT THAT IT IS THE UNANIMOUS AND FIRM CONVICTION OF THE POLITICAL AND
                            LEGAL OFFICERS OF THIS MISSION, AND IT IS MY OPINION, THAT FOR U.S. TO
                            VETO THE ADMISSION OF THE VIETNAMS WOULD BE A CALAMITY. WE WOULD BE SEEN
                            TO ACT OUT OF BITTERNESS, BLINDNESS, WEAKNESS AND FEAR. WE WOULD BE SEEN
                            NOT ONLY TO HAVE LOST THE HABIT OF VICTORY, BUT IN THE PROCESS TO HAVE
                            ACQUIRED THE MOST PITEOUS STIGMATA OF DEFEAT. BUT THERE WOULD BE LITTLE
                            PITY. THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE WOULD BE CONTEMPT, NOT LEAST FROM OUR
                            ALLIES.</p>
                        <p>8. THIS SATISFACTION SAVORED, THE NEXT STEP OF ASSORTED ENEMIES AND
                            ADVERSARIES WOULD BE TO MOVE DIRECTLY TO EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITY
                            PRESENTED BY THE AMERICAN VETO OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY. (THE
                            FIRST VETO BY U.S. OF A MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION, AND ONE PRESUMABLY BASED
                            ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LINKAGE WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE HAS
                            ADVISED IS ILLEGAL.) SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY. CHILE PERHAPS. THEN ISRAEL. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE
                            PROFESSIONAL OFFICERS OF THIS MISSION THAT THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES WHICH
                            A VIETNAM VETO WOULD AROUSE COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VICTORY
                            AND DEFEAT ON THE QUESTION OF ISRAELI EXPULSION FROM THE GENERAL
                            ASSEMBLY. IF ISRAEL IS EXPELLED, THE WORLD WILL BE ASSURED THAT THIS
                            CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF AMERICAN BLUNDERS WHICH UNDERMINED EVERY PRINCIPLE
                            ON WHICH THE ARAB DEMAND MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESISTED. THIS VIEW WILL
                            INEVITABLY BE SHARED BY MANY IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                        <p>9. AFTER THE EXPULSION OF ISRAEL FROM THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THAT BODY,
                            INDIFFERENT TO ANY APPEAL WE MIGHT MAKE OR ANY THAT MIGHT BE MADE ON OUR
                            BEHALF, WILL PROCEED TO DEMAND THE EXPULSION OF AMERICAN FORCES FROM
                            SOUTH KOREA. FOR A QUARTER CENTURY OUR FORCES HAVE SEEN THERE AT THE
                            BEHEST OF WORLD OPINION AS CONSTITUTED IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THEY
                            WILL THEREAFTER BE THERE IN DEFIANCE OF IT, HOWEVER LEGALLY. IN THE BEST
                            OF COMING CIRCUMSTANCES IT WILL BE HARD INDEED TO GAIN A MAJORITY FOR
                            OUR RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
                            TO BECOME SUCCESSORS IN COMMAND THERE. BUT IN THE PROFESSIONAL OPINION
                            OF THE MISSION OFFICERS CONCERNED, OUR CHANCES WOULD FALL DRAMATICALLY
                            IN THE AFTERMATH OF A VIETNAM VETO. SOUTH KOREA WILL BE INCREASINGLY
                            ISOLATED. OUR SUPPORT WILL INCREASINGLY BE DISPUTED WITHIN THE UNITED
                            STATES ITSELF. THE QUESTION OF WAR OR THE ABANDONMENT OF AN ALLY BECOMES
                            A QUESTION OF WHEN. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL KNOW THIS, AS FOR EXAMPLE
                            IT KNEW ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR TWO, BUT CONGRESSIONAL AND PUBLIC
                            OPINION WILL BE UTTERLY INACCESSIBLE TO ALL WARNINGS.</p>
                        <p>10. WHAT WOULD COME WITH WAR OR ABANDONMENT WE CAN HARDLY SAY. BUT THE
                            EXPULSION OF ISRAEL WILL BE DISASTER ENOUGH. THE UNITED STATES SENATE
                            HAS ALREADY RESOLVED THAT IN SUCH A EVENT WE MUST CONSIDER WITHDRAWAL
                            FROM THE UNITED NATIONS ITSELF. WE COULD QUICKLY FIND OURSELF HAVING
                            WITHDRAWN FROM THE VERY INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM WE OURSELVES CREATED,
                            LEAVING IT TO OUR ENEMIES. THEY WILL PROCEED TO TREAT US AS AN OUTCAST
                            AND INCREASINGLY OUTLAWED NATION IN A WORLD SYSTEM THAT IS THEIRS NOT
                            OURS.</p>
                        <p>11. THIS NEED NOT HAPPEN. WE CAN ACCEPT THE VIETNAMS AND FROM THERE
                            COMMENCE A SUSTAINED AND IF NEEDS BE NOISY INSISTENCE THAT THE MEMBERS
                            OF THE UNITED NATIONS LIVE UP TO THE CHARTER AND TO THEIR OWN
                            PROFESSIONS. WE WILL HAVE RIGHT ON OUR SIDE, AND WHO KNOWS BUT THAT
                            AFTER A POINT A FAIR NUMBER OF MEMBERS WILL NOTE THAT WE HAVE A VERY
                            CONSIDERABLY AMOUNT OF POWER ALSO. <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"

                                abstentions, including the United States) requesting that the

                                governments. On September 30, the United States again vetoed in the

                            OUTCOME, OF COURSE, WOULD BE ADMISSION TO UN OF ROC (AND NORTH KOREA
                            ALSO IF IT DECIDED TO APPLY) ALONG WITH VIETNAMS AND THIS SHOULD BE KEPT

                            NOT INTEND TO APPROACH EITHER OF THE VIETNAMS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE NEAR
                            TERM, LEAVING TO USSR COMMUNICATION OF OUR VIEWS TO VIETNAM.</p>
                        <p>4. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT NECESSARY NOT ONLY THAT USSR AND PRC NOT
                            OPPOSE KOREAN MEMBERSHIP IN SECURITY COUNCIL BUT THAT THEY AGREE NOT TO
                            LOBBY TO BLOCK ROK APPLICATION (OUR PRESENT READING IS THAT WE HAVE ONLY
                            7 CERTAIN VOTES ON SECURITY COUNCIL AND WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT TWO MORE
                            EVEN WITHOUT SOVIET AND CHINESE VETOES).</p>
                        <p>5. WHEN AND IF SECRETARY APPROVES OF THIS COURSE, USUN SHOULD ARRANGE TO

                        <p>6. SMUN DEP REP SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR SOVIET EMBASSY
                            IN WASHINGTON, AT THE REQUEST OF HANOI, ASKED IF THE <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WOULD SUPPORT THE ADMISSION OF NORTH
                            AND SOUTH VIETNAM INTO THE UN. WE ASKED THEN IF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
                            WOULD BE WILLING TO FACILITATE SOUTH KOREA'S APPLICATION, JUST AS WE
                            WOULD CONCUR IN NORTH KOREA'S APPLICATION WERE THEY TO APPLY. USG HAS
                            GIVEN FURTHER CAREFUL STUDY SINCE THEN TO THE QUESTION OF MEMBERSHIP IN
                            THE UN FOR THE TWO VIETNAMS AND BELIEVES THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME IT
                            WOULD NOT BE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE ORGANIZATION TO CONSIDER THESE
                            APPLICATIONS UNTIL THE QUESTION OF UN MEMBERSHIP FOR ALL PRESENTLY
                            DIVIDED STATES CAN BE RESOLVED.</p>
                        <p>7. FAILURE TO STRIVE FOR AND MAINTAIN FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE UN NOT
                            HELPFUL TO ACHIEVING THE REDUCTION OF TENSIONS IN WHICH BOTH US AND USSR
                            ARE INTERESTED.</p>
                        <p>8. THE COMBINATION OF THE VIETNAMS' RECENT APPLICATION AND SOUTH KOREA'S
                            LONG-STANDING APPLICATION GIVES THE UN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A DEGREE
                            OF NORMALITY AND STABILITY TO BOTH OF THESE AREAS, THE SCENE OF MUCH
                            DISRUPTIVE INTERNATIONAL TENSION. WE BELIEVE THE ADMISSION OF ALL OF
                            THESE APPLICANTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL
                            TENSIONS AND, TOGETHER WITH THE ANTICIPATED ADMISSION OF MOZAMBIQUE,
                            ANGOLA, AND OTHERS, VIRTUALLY COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF UNIVERSAL
                            ASSOCIATION WITH THE UN. BOTH OUR COUNTRIES SHARE AN INTEREST IN
                            REDUCTIONS OF TENSION AND FULL PARTICIPATION OF STATES IN THE UN AND WE
                            HOPE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WOULD FACILITATE ALL OF THESE
                            APPLICATIONS.</p>
                        <p>9. YOU SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE INCREASINGLY SKEPTICAL PUBLIC
                            OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY TOWARD THE UN COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY
                            THE SPECTACLE OF THE ADMISSION OF TWO VIETNAMS WHILE SOUTH KOREA IS
                            EXCLUDED. FURTHERMORE, CRITICS OF DETENTE WOULD FIND A FURTHER RATIONALE
                            FOR ARGUING THAT IT WAS A ONE WAY STREET, ESPECIALLY IF IT BECAME CLEAR
                            THAT THE SOVIET POSITION WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN CAUSING THE SECURITY
                            COUNCIL TO FAIL TO CONSIDER AND ENDORSE SOUTH KOREAN MEMBERSHIP. SOVIETS
                            SHOULD UNDERSTAND PARTICULARLY WELL THE ADVERSE PUBLIC REACTION WHICH
                            WOULD BE GENERATED IN THE US BY SUCH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SOUTH
                            KOREA.</p>
                        <p>10. ADMISSION OF BOTH VIETNAMS IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED EXCLUSION OF THE
                            REPUBLIC OF KOREA WOULD IN FACT CREATE SUCH ADDED DIFFICULTIES FOR THE
                            CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE UN IN THE US AND HAVE SUCH A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON
                            THE PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE STABILITY ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA THAT WE WOULD
                            BE PREPARED TO USE OUR VETO TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING. WE MUCH PREFER
                            ENTRY OF ALL DIVIDED COUNTRIES, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO FUTURE UNIFICATION.
                            WE BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT.</p>
                        <p>11. WHILE THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE RENEWING THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION
                            TO THE UN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD PRESS SC CONSIDERATION
                            UNLESS SC WERE TO BE CONVENED TO CONSIDER VIETNAMESE APPLICATIONS.
                            THEREFORE, IF THE SOVIETS ARE UNWILLING AT THIS TIME TO SUPPORT SOUTH
                            KOREA'S APPLICATION, WE BELIEVE THAT BEST SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR TWO
                            VIETNAMS TO LEAVE THEIR APPLICATIONS STANDING BUT NOT PRESS FOR EARLY
                            CONSIDERATION. MEANTIME, WE WOULD EXPECT TO CONTINUE CONSULTATION WITH
                            USSR AND OTHER PERMANENT SC MEMBERS WITH A VIEW TO REACHING AGREEMENT ON
                            SOLUTION WHICH WILL BRING ALL DIVIDED STATES WHO WISH MEMBERSHIP INTO
                            UN.</p>
                        <p>12. SMUN WILL BE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ISSUED VISAS TO <gloss
                                target="#t_PRGSV1">PRG</gloss> AND NVN OBSERVERS AND HAVE NOT POSED
                            ANY OBJECTION TO THEIR ENTRY OR PARTICIPATION AS OBSERVERS IN THE WORK
                            OF THE UN. WE BELIEVE THAT FOR THESE GOVERNMENTS, AS WAS THE CASE FOR
                            THE TWO GERMAN STATES, THE PRESENCE IN NEW YORK OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
                            ON THE SAME BASIS AS THAT OF THE TWO KOREAN STATES CAN BE A USEFUL
                            PRELUDE TO THE INCLUSION OF ALL FOUR STATES.</p>
                        <p>13. YOU SHOULD ADD THAT WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE SOVIETS, SINCE THEY
                            APPROACHED US INITIALLY ON BEHALF OF THE VIETNAMESE, MAKE OUR CONSIDERED
                            VIEWS KNOWN IN FULL TO THE TWO VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENTS, ADDING THAT OUR
                            POSITION IS ONE OF SEEKING TO BRING ADMISSION OF DIVIDED STATES ABOUT IN
                            A CONTEXT CONDUCIVE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE,
                            ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN ASIA, AND HELPFUL TO THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL UN
                            MEMBERSHIP. WE HOPE THAT WE WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE PLACED IN
                            CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE TO VOTE NEGATIVELY.</p>
                        <p>14. USUN, IN CONVEYING FOREGOING FULLY, SHOULD REPORT ANY REACTIONS OR
                            COMMENTS. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE SOVIETS SHOULD CITE THE 1948
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> ADVISORY OPINION. YOU MAY
                            COMMENT THAT NEITHER THE USSR NOR THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAVE EXPRESSED
                            SUPPORT FOR THIS OPINION AND THAT, RELUCTANT AS WE ARE TO DEVIATE FROM
                            IT, WE REGARD THE CONSIDERATIONS PRESENTED AS MORE COMPELLING AT THIS
                            MOMENT.</p>
                        <p>15. FOR SECRETARY. USUN WILL EXECUTE FOREGOING AS SOON AS YOA APPROVE. WE
                            BELIEVE IT DESIRABLE THAT FOREGOING MESSAGE GET TO VIETNAMESE BEFORE
                            THEIR OBSERVERS SEEK TO SET DATE OF SC MEETING ON THEIR APPLICATIONS
                            SINCE WE WOULD HAVE LITTLE SUPPORT IN SC FOR DELAYING MEETING. RECOMMEND
                            THAT YOU TAKE OPPORTUNITY IN TALKS WITH <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"

                            KOREAN QUESTION</p>
                        <p>FOR THE SECRETARY FROM <persName corresp="#p_IRS1">INGERSOLL</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. A VERY AGITATED PAT MOYNIHAN TELEPHONED ME THIS MORNING FROM NEW YORK.
                            HE SPENT 30 MINUTES TRYING TO CONVINCE ME OF THE WISDOM OF <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>'S PREFERRED SCENARIO (USUN 3412) FOR
                            HANDLING THE VIETNAM AND KOREAN MEMBERSHIP QUESTIONS. HE INSISTED THAT
                            ANY VETO OF THE VIETNAMESE APPLICATIONS WOULD BE VIEWED BY THE VAST
                            MAJORITY OF UN MEMBERS AS VINDICTIVENESS ON OUR PART FOR WHICH WE WILL
                            ALMOST CERTAINLY SUFFER RETALIATION IN THE FORM OF SUSPENSION OF ISRAEL.
                            HE BELIEVES THE MIND-SET OF SENIOR ADVISERS SUCCEEDED IN DESTROYING TWO
                            PRESIDENTS ON THE VIETNAM ISSUE AND MAY NOW THREATEN A THIRD. PAT FEELS
                            VERY STRONGLY AND INDEED SAID TWICE THAT PERHAPS HE SHOULD NOT HAVE
                            TAKEN THE UN JOB.</p>
                        <p>2. I TRIED REPEATEDLY TO CONVINCE PAT THAT OUR FOCUS WAS ON GETTING KOREA
                            INTO THE UN, NOT ON KEEPING THE VIETNAMESE OUT OF IT, AND THAT WE
                            THOUGHT THE CASE COULD BE ARGUED NOT ONLY LOGICALLY BUT WITH POLITICAL
                            IMPACT. NEVERTHELESS, I SUGGESTED THAT IF HE FELT SO STRONGLY HE SHOULD
                            APPEAL TO YOU DIRECTLY.</p>
                        <p>3. I SUBSEQUENTLY DISCUSSED THIS CONVERSATION WITH <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWB1">BUFFUM</persName>, WHO AT MY INSTRUCTION CALLED
                            PAT TO REVIEW IN GREATER DETAIL THE ANALYSIS WHICH UNDERLAY YOUR
                            DECISION. BUFFUM CALLED ME BACK TO SAY PAT HAD CALMED DOWN SOMEWHAT,
                            THOUGH HE IS STILL UNHAPPY.</p>
                        <p>4. I WANTED YOU TO BE AWARE OF THIS EPISODE, NOT SO MUCH FOR WHAT IT SAYS
                            ABOUT PAT'S STEWARDSHIP IN NEW YORK (WE ALL KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT) BUT FOR
                            ITS REFLECTION OF GRAVE APPREHENSIONS WITHIN USUN ON THE VIETNAM AND
                            KOREAN MEMBERSHIP FIGHT, AND ITS EFFECT ON THE POSITION OF ISRAEL.

                        <p>Politicization of International Technical Organizations</p>
                        <p>INTRODUCTION AND KEY JUDGMENTS</p>
                        <p>The United States has experienced varying degrees of success and
                            difficulty in achieving its goals within the United Nations system over
                            the ears. There is a growing perception, however, that during the past
                            two years the actions of a coalition of the world's small states has
                            made the maintenance of US interests in that body more difficult than
                            ever. Politicization has become the standard term used by bureaucrats,
                            journalists, congressmen, and academics to describe the wide spectrum of
                            difficulties which the US now faces in international institutions. There
                            has been particular concern that politicization has now spread from the
                            General Assembly to the international technical and specialized
                            organizations which the US has long valued as assemblies where the
                            technical bases for broader international cooperation could be somewhat
                            dispassionately established.</p>
                        <p>This study attempts to measure whether, and in what forms, politicization
                            is increasing in these technical organizations, and what the
                            consequences could be for US interests. Particular attention is given to
                            establishing whether political issues have altered or interfered with
                            the chartered mission and work of these agencies, and to sorting out any
                            rising trends of political debate from the standard "noise level" of
                            politics which is found in all international gatherings. This study also
                            examines the meaning of politicization as seen by many of the US
                            officials who must deal most directly with its manifestations and
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>This study finds that despite a high level of political rhetoric,
                            external political issues appear to have caused only minor damage to the
                            substantive effectiveness of these organizations. The dichotomy between
                            rhetorical and substantive politicization is rooted in the character and
                            operating environment of the technical organizations as well as in the
                            contradictory interests of the member-states. Thus, while the LDCs may
                            find political speeches essential to a particular occasion, they are
                            often either unwilling or unable to disrupt the functioning of these
                            groups. This reflects in some cases their anticipation of benefits from
                            the organizations, and in other cases their lack of specific interest or
                            technical competence in the matters at hand.</p>
                        <p>The low level of actual damage from politicization thus far also reflects
                            the strong US position in these organizations--especially the high
                            caliber of its expertise and its good standing with the professional
                            secretariats. Prospects are good that, by pursuing these advantages, the
                            US can act to maintain the dichotomy and prevent any progression beyond
                            rhetorical political activity in the technical organizations.</p>

                        <p>PLACE: Secretary General's Office, UN Headquarters</p>
                        <p>Waldheim: On the ILO matter, I have received a desperate note from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BF3">Blanchard</persName> asking that I raise
                            this personally with you and obtain your help. The point is that
                            withdrawal would affect the whole UN system in general.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The labor movement in the U.S. is not used to losing,
                            contrary to the beliefs of most FSOs. <persName corresp="#p_MG8"
                                >Meany</persName> is up in arms--absolutely. If we do not give
                            notice of our intent to withdraw, Labor will force Congress to cut off
                            all contributions. They will, however, consider giving notice for two
                            years but without this Congress would certainly cut off the funds now.
                            If Meany indicates any preference for reforms and if one or two are
                            carried out, in a year from now he may cooperate. Congress is now about
                            to vote on our contribution. If we give notice, he will let us pay for
                            two years. This is our best way to stay in; meanwhile we can continue to
                            study the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Blanchard is basically well intentioned. We will look
                            again, but really we do not have much leeway. Meany states that at the
                            last session there were only four votes with us. On issue after issue we
                            are voted down. Meany thinks the European labor movements are voting
                            with the communists.</p>
                        <p>Waldheim: If we give the notice then this would give us an opportunity to
                            regroup.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If we can work out an accommodation with Meany, a symbolic
                            victory would make it easier for now to get along with him. Now he knows
                            we will consider a notice. By the device of a notice we will put off a
                            decision until early 1977. Then we'll be better off.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Make clear that if you do this, we'll want reform.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes. We have a group now under <persName corresp="#p_DJT2"
                                >Dunlop</persName> working on recommendations for changes. Also, I
                            saw Meany last Friday. If we forced the issue this year, we would have
                            lost. We do not have the votes. We simply cannot get money from Congress
                            for a labor group when our own labor people oppose it.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Dunlop once worked in ILO and is a friend of Blanchard.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: He is an expert on ILO. I know.</p>
                        <p>Waldheim: Blanchard has mentioned Dunlop.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary We cannot do it now but we should work together for two
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Moynihan: Dunlop has Meany's confidence. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yeah, I wish I had.</p>

                            INAPPROPRIATELY, IT WAS THE IRISH AMBASSADOR, STANDING IN THE BACK OF
                            COMMITTEE ROOM THREE AS THE FINAL VOTE APPROACHED IN WHICH THE WORLD
                            ORGANIZATION WOULD PUT ITSELF ON THE POINT OF OFFICIALLY ENDORSING
                            ANTI-SEMITISM, WHO SAID "THE UNITED NATIONS IS DESTROYING ITSELF; THIS
                            NIGHT, IN THIS ROOM."</p>
                        <p>3. AND YET STRONG THINGS SHOWED THROUGH ALSO. THE MOST STRIKING WAS THAT
                            THE BLACK AFRICANS BROKE WITH THE ARABS WHO PROPOSED TO USE THEM IN THE
                            MOST CYNICAL AND SELF SERVING WAY, NOT, ONE MIGHT ADD, FOR THE FIRST
                            TIME RECORDED IN HISTORY. IN THIS REGARD, THE UNITED STATES TOOK THE
                            INITIATIVE ON OCTOBER THREE BY MAKING UNMISTAKABLY CLEAR THAT TO EQUATE
                            ZIONISM WITH RACISM WAS AN OBSCENE ACT THAT COULD ONLY END BY ABORTING
                            THE PROPOSED DECADE TO COMBAT RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, AN
                            EFFORT WHICH THE AFRICANS HAS PROPOSED, AND FOR WHICH, IN THE ABSENCE OF
                            THE <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>-ARAB-SOVIET BLOCK DEMARCHE,
                            WOULD HAVE WON UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THE WEST
                            EUROPEANS WERE PERSUADED TO JOIN US IN THE POSITION THAT WE WOULD VOTE
                            IN COMMITTEE FOR EACH OF THE TWO RESOLUTIONS ESTABLISHING THE DECADE TO
                            COMBAT RACISM, AND AGAINST THE RESOLUTION EQUATING ZIONISM WITH RACISM,
                            WITH PRIOR UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THE LATTER RESOLUTION PASSED, WE WOULD
                            THEREFORE VOTE AGAINST ALL THREE RESOLUTIONS WHEN THEY CAME TO THE
                            GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THE AFRICAN STATES, WHICH ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF
                            SEEING THEIR TRUE INTERESTS IN SUCH MATTERS, SAW THAT THE ARABS WERE
                            TAKING SOMETHING OF VALUE FROM THEM AND GIVING NOTHING IN RETURN. IN THE
                            KEY VOTE ON A RESOLUTION OF SIERRA LEONE, SECONDED BY ZAMBIA, TO PUT OFF
                            CONSIDERATION OF THE ANTI-SEMITIC RESOLUTION UNTIL 1976, ONLY 42 PERCENT
                            OF THE BLACK AFRICAN STATES VOTED WITH THE ARABS. IN THE FINAL VOTE, ON
                            THE ANTI-SEMITIC RESOLUTION ITSELF, ONLY ABOUT HALF THE AFRICANS VOTED
                            WITH THE ARABS. AS THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS THIS MORNING, "A YEAR
                            AGO, THE ARABS HAD AN 'AUTOMATIC MAJORITY' OF COMMUNIST, AFRICAN AND
                            ASIAN NATIONS AND THE NERVOUS ABSTENTIONS OF MOST WEST EUROPEANS." WELL,
                            THIS TIME THE WEST EUROPEANS GOT HOLD OF THEIR NERVE, AND AS THE POST
                            REPORT CONTINUES, "THE AFRICANS REBELLED."</p>
                        <p>4. APART FROM THIS, THE MOST STRIKING SHOWING THROUGH WAS THAT OF LATIN
                            AMERICA, WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY SIDED WITH THE COMMUNIST AND ANTI-SEMITE
                            SIDE. ONLY THE TINY STATES OF COSTA RICA (GOD LOVE THEM) THE DOMINICAN
                            REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, HAITI, NICARAGUA, AND URUGUAY DARED TO VOTE WITH THE
                            DEMOCRACIES ON THIS ISSUE. ALL THE OTHERS COLLAPSED, NAY GROVELED IN THE
                            FACE OF COMMUNIST THREAT, ARAB MONEY, AND THE NO DOUBT IRRESISTIBLE
                            OPPORTUNITY TO BE VICIOUS.</p>
                        <p>5. THE MOST EPIPHANIC ACT OF THE EVENING WAS THE VOTE BY CHILE IN FAVOR
                            OF THE COMMUNISTS AND THE ARABS. WE HAVE NO RELIABLE INFORMATION AS TO
                            WHY THEY DID THIS. OPINION IN THE US MISSION IS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED.
                            ONE GROUP HOLDS THAT FASCISTS ARE NATURALLY ANTI-SEMITIC, AND THAT THE
                            GENERALS WERE ONLY DOING WHAT CAME NATURALLY. ANOTHER, LESS HISTORICAL,
                            MORE CYNICAL GROUP, HOLDS THAT OPINION IN THE <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> CORRIDORS IS CORRECT, NAMELY THAT THE CHILEANS SOLD
                            THEIR VOTE TO THE ARABS IN RETURN FOR AGREEMENT NOT TO PRESS THE REPORT
                            OF THE WORKING GROUP OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, PUBLISHED THIS
                            WEEK, THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS OPERATING "TORTURE CENTERS"
                            THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND SUCH BREADTH AS THERE IS OF THAT UNHAPPY
                            COUNTRY. A FRACTION OF EMBASSY OPINION NOT NOTED FOR ACCURACY, BUT
                            NONETHELESS DIFFICULT TO DISMISS, CLAIMS THAT THROUGH A COMPLEX CIPHER
                            IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT PINOCHET IS ACTUALLY ALLENDE IN DISGUISE AND THERE
                            HAS BEEN NO CHANGE.</p>
                        <p>6. LASTLY THERE SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE ONLY TWENTY NINE NATIONS VOTED
                            AGAINST THE ANTI-SEMITIC RESOLUTION, THE UNITED STATES CAN BE PROUD OF
                            THE COMPANY IT WAS IN. AN ISSUE OF HONOR, OF MORALITY WAS PUT BEFORE US,
                            AND NOT ALL OF US RAN. <persName corresp="#p_MDP1">MOYNIHAN</persName>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Future Relations with the International Labor Organization
                            (ILO)</p>
                        <p>After consultation with Secretaries Kissinger and Morton, I am submitting
                            for your information the following considerations concerning our future
                            relations with the ILO.</p>
                        <p>The ILO was established to specify by conventions international labor
                            standards and to improve working conditions, create employment, and
                            promote human rights. It also carries out technical assistance programs
                            in less developed countries.</p>
                        <p>The ILO is older than most <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> specialized
                            agencies; it was founded in 1919. AFL President Samuel Gompers chaired
                            the Commission which drafted the ILO constitution at the Paris Peace
                            Conference. The United States joined in 1934. We pay 25 percent of the
                            ILO budget, or $11,000,000 in 1975. The ILO is unique among
                            international agencies in that it is tripartite. The U.S. tripartite
                            Delegation to the annual Conference, which traditionally concerns itself
                            with the development of labor standards, is composed of two delegates
                            from the Government and one each from the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of
                            Commerce of the United States. The two Government delegates normally
                            come from the Department of Labor and Department of State with an
                            alternate from the Department of Commerce. The United States has a
                            Government seat (filled by the Department of Labor) on the tripartite
                            Governing Body, which acts as a board of directors in providing
                            instructions and guidance to the Director General. The U.S. worker
                            delegate from the AFL-CIO, and the U.S. employer delegate from the U.S.
                            Chamber have been elected to three year terms as Worker and Employer
                            members of the Governing Body by their respective groups of the ILO
                            Conference. Government, workers, and employers participate autonomously
                            and vote separately, but the U.S. Government can continue to participate
                            effectively only if U.S. Workers and Employers continue to support the
                            Organization.</p>
                        <p>When the ILO Conference in June 1975 granted observer status to the
                            Palestine Liberation Organization, the U.S. Workers walked out of the
                            Conference and the Employers, together with the Government Delegation
                            acting on instructions from Secretaries Kissinger and Dunlop, left for
                            the balance of the day. The ILO action on the <gloss target="#t_PLO1"
                                >PLO</gloss> was the latest event in a trend toward politicizing the
                            ILO, diverting it from substantive work. The annual Conference spends
                            too much time on political issues. Totalitarian states persistently seek
                            to weaken the role of Workers and Employers, and the ILO itself seems
                            indifferent to Communist bloc violations of its Conventions on Freedom
                            of Association and Forced Labor.</p>
                        <p>The AFL-CIO Executive Council has now called on the U.S. Government to
                            give the constitutionally required two-year notice of intent to withdraw
                            from the ILO. The AFL-CIO Convention subsequently adopted a resolution
                            calling for a reassessment of U.S. membership in the ILO. Until such a
                            notice is transmitted, the AFL-CIO will not support payment of dues to
                            the Organization and has pressured both Houses of Congress to cut off
                            Department of State appropriations for these dues. Joint House Senate
                            Conferees have opted for the House version which suspends payments for
                            the last half of 1975.</p>
                        <p>An earlier crisis was reached in 1970 when Congress, stimulated in part
                            by the AFL-CIO, cut off ILO dues for two years after the ILO appointed a
                            Russian to a high-level position in the Secretariat. Although the funds
                            cutoff was mildly successful in reducing political attacks, many
                            countries considered that by failure to pay dues we had violated our
                            treaty obligations.</p>
                        <p>The only means provided in the ILO Constitution to terminate membership
                            is the issuance of a two-year notice of intent to withdraw. Should a
                            notice be issued, the U.S. could press for reforms and, if satisfied,
                            would be able to abort the action at any time within the two-year
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Issue: In arriving at our unanimous recommendation that the U.S. should
                            give the two-year notice of intent to withdraw, the following advantages
                            and disadvantages were considered.</p>
                        <p>Advantages: </p>
                        <p>--The U.S. Government cannot continue effectively to participate if
                            future U.S. Worker and/or Employer participation is in doubt. The
                            AFL-CIO has made it clear that it will not support further dues payments
                            to the ILO until a letter of intent to withdraw is issued. The concerned
                            committees of the U.S. Chamber agree with sending a letter of intent,
                            and the position of the Chamber as to the timing of the letter will be
                            decided by its Executive Committee in late October or early
                            November.</p>
                        <p>--The interim period will provide an opportunity for labor and
                            management, working with the Government, to develop a vigorous program
                            of activities to reverse the objectionable trends in the ILO, and to
                            ensure the U.S./ILO policy is reviewed continuously at high levels in
                            State, Labor, and Commerce.</p>
                        <p>--A letter of intent is the only way we can establish a terminal date for
                            US assessments, should we actually withdraw in two years.</p>
                        <p>--The letter may make the ILO, as well as other UN agencies, more
                            amenable to reforms suggested by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages: </p>
                        <p>--U.S. Workers, Employers, and Government have never committed adequate
                            resources for ILO work; a letter of withdrawal could be regarded as
                            premature.</p>
                        <p>--U.S. influence in support of our main objectives--such as preserving
                            tripartism and human rights--may diminish with the prospect of U.S.
                            withdrawal, since the U.S. would in effect be a lame duck. In such
                            circumstances, our adversaries could benefit.</p>
                        <p>--Some ILO Member States may resent the letter which they may regard as a
                            bluff.</p>
                        <p>--A letter of intent to withdraw from one UN agency may have a domino
                            effect on Congressional attitudes toward membership in other UN
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>Tab A provides a draft of the letter of intent to withdraw developed by
                            the Departments of Labor and Commerce. The Department of State has
                            reservations both as to the length of the letter and its specificity
                            regarding the issues of concern to the United States. We will continue
                            our consultations to resolve these differences within the next two
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p>1. Congressional Consultations.</p>
                        <p>Consultations with appropriate members of the Senate and the House, to
                            inform them in advance of the decision to issue a letter of intent to
                            withdraw and the reasons therefore, will be undertaken by the
                            Departments of State, Commerce and Labor.</p>
                        <p>2. Timing the letter of intent will be sent before the next session of
                            the ILO Governing Body convenes on November 10. The precise timing will
                            be worked out by the Secretary of State in consultation with the
                            Secretaries of Commerce and Labor.</p>
                        <p>3. Intensified U.S. Participation.</p>
                        <p>It is imperative to assemble a high level consultative committee to
                            develop an ILO action program. Such a committee would not only deal with
                            the US/ILO policy but would ultimately advise you on withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>While the committee is being formed, there are a number of actions we can
                            take with existing staff; for example establishing a close consultative
                            network with like-minded member states to arrive at joint positions on
                            issues before the ILO and closer consultation with the ILO Director
                            General and his office.</p>

                        <p>2. TEXT OF PRESIDENTIAL LETTER:</p>
                        <p>"DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:</p>
                        <p>I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE A
                            SPECIAL MISSION TO EUROPEAN CAPITALS AS MY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE TO
                            REVIEW OUR RELATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION. YOUR
                            BACKGROUND IN LABOR AFFAIRS AND YOUR DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE WILL BE
                            PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN CARRYING OUT THIS IMPORTANT TASK.</p>
                        <p>WHEN THE UNITED STATES NOTIFIED THE ILO ON NOVEMBER 6, 1975, OF ITS
                            INTENT TO WITHDRAW UNLESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TOOK PLACE, THERE WERE
                            SEVERAL KEY ISSUES WHICH WERE, AND STILL ARE, OF GRAVE CONCERN TO US:
                            THE EROSION OF THE TRIPARTITE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE ILO WAS FOUNDED;
                            THE DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS TO SOME MEMBER STATES; THE APPLICATION IN SOME
                            INSTANCES OF A "DOUBLE STANDARD" WHEN THE ILO CONSIDERS ALLEGED
                            VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS; AND AN INCREASING TREND TOWARDS
                            POLITICIZATION OF THE ILO. WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE ILO AND ITS
                            OBJECTIVES, AND OUR NOTICE OF INTENT TO WITHDRAW DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE
                            UNITED STATES HAS DECIDED IRREVOCABLY TO TAKE THAT STEP. IT IS OUR HOPE
                            THAT THE PROBLEMS WE SEE IN THE ILO CAN BE RESOLVED AND THAT U.S.
                            MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION WILL CONTINUE. SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING OUR
                            GOAL WILL DEPEND IN LARGE MEASURE ON OBTAINING THE COOPERATION OF OTHER
                            MEMBERS.</p>
                        <p>IN THE COURSE OF YOUR SPECIAL MISSION, YOU SHOULD CONVEY TO THE
                            GOVERNMENTS WITH WHICH YOU CONSULT THE IMPORTANCE AND URGENCY THAT I
                            ATTACH TO THESE ISSUES. I HOPE THAT WHEN THE DEPTH OF OUR CONCERN IS
                            UNDERSTOOD, OTHER ILO MEMBERS WILL JOIN WITH US IN BRINGING THE
                            ORGANIZATION BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL GOALS AND PURPOSES.</p>
                        <p>I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOUR EFFORTS WILL HAVE POSITIVE RESULTS, AND I ASK
                            THAT YOU KEEP ME INFORMED ON THE PROGRESS OF YOUR MISSION.</p>

                            LABOR MINISTERS OF VARIOUS NATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE WAS COMPLETELY
                            NONPLUSSED BY MY RELUCTANCE TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF VARIOUS ISSUES
                            AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ASKED FOR ELABORATION OF OUR LETTER. AT ONE POINT HE
                            CONTENDED THAT AMBASSADOR <persName corresp="#p_MDP1"
                                >MOYNIHAN</persName> AGREED WITH HIM THAT OUR LETTER WAS
                            INSUFFICIENTLY DETAILED. I RESISTED GETTING INTO A DETAILED DISCUSSION
                            OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD EXPLORED WITH VARIOUS GOVTS AND ALLUDED TO THEM
                            ONLY GENERALLY.</p>
                        <p>4. SOMEWHAT OFF BALANCE, BLANCHARD AT ONE POINT SAID HE COULD NOT BELIEVE
                            THE U.S. WOULD LEAVE THE ILO, AND AT ANOTHER, THAT HE WAS AFRAID WE HAD
                            ALREADY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ILO. I INDICATED THAT I WAS NOT UNDULY
                            OPTIMISTIC SINCE UNLESS MEMBER NATIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE INDUSTRIAL
                            DEMOCRACIES AGREED TO A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE
                            ISSUES SET FORTH IN THE SECRETARY'S LETTER, OUR COURSE OF ACTION WAS
                            DETERMINED. BLANCHARD EXPRESSED CONCERN WHETHER 23 DEMOCRACIES COULD
                            MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND EMPHASIZED HIS DESIRE TO BE NEUTRAL. I RESPONDED
                            THAT WE REGARD NEUTRALITY AS REQUIRING FEALTY TO THE BASIC PURPOSES AND
                            STRUCTURE OF THE ILO.</p>
                        <p>5. IN RESPONSE TO THE POINTS IN LETTER, BLANCHARD ARGUED THAT OUR
                            POSITION ON DOUBLE STANDARD WAS MISCONCEIVED BECAUSE OF THE
                            PROFESSIONALISM OF THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS, TO WHICH I RESPONDED THAT
                            OUR CONCERN WAS MORE FOR THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON APPLICATION OF
                            CONVENTION AND THE CONFERENCE PLENARY. BLANCHARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG8">GEORGE MEANY</persName> HAD RAISED THE
                            SAME POINT WITH HIM. HE EMPHASIZED THAT HE AGREED WITH OUR BASIC
                            POSITIONS, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD CONSISTENTLY URGED ILO MEMBERS TO COMPLY
                            WITH DUE PROCESS POINTING OUT THAT ONLY LAST WEEK HE HAD SUGGESTED THIS
                            TO THE SOVIET UNION. HE EXPRESSED COMPLETE SUPPORT FOR U.S. PROPOSAL TO
                            AMEND ARTICLE 17 OF THE STANDING ORDERS.</p>
                        <p>6. AFTER HE MENTIONED GEORGE MEANY SEVERAL TIMES, I EMPHASIZED THE
                            BREADTH OF CONSENSUS ON U.S. ILO POLICY. BLANCHARD ACKNOWLEDGED IT BUT
                            CONTENDED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH NUANCES OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS
                            OF STATE, LABOR AND COMMERCE. I DISCOUNTED THAT.</p>
                        <p>7. AT LUNCH I ASKED BLANCHARD WHAT THE SOVIET POSITION WAS ON THE
                            UPCOMING ELECTIONS AND ON U.S. POLICY GENERALLY. BLANCHARD DESCRIBED
                            THEM AS VERY QUIET, INDEED. I ASKED WHY THAT WAS SO AND HIS ASSOCIATES
                            SUGGESTED TWO POSSIBILITIES: (1) FORTIN, THAT THE SOVIETS DID NOT WANT
                            TO BE BLAMED FOR PRECIPITATING U.S. WITHDRAWAL AND (2) WOLF THAT WITHOUT
                            THE U.S. AS A BACKBOARD, SOVIET PROPAGANDA EFFORTS IN THE <gloss
                                target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL. FOR
                            OBVIOUS REASONS BLANCHARD EXPRESSED DISPLEASURE WITH THE LATTER
                            SUGGESTION.</p>
                        <p>8. AFTER LUNCH, AT HOROWITZ' SUGGESTION, I PULLED BLANCHARD ASIDE AND
                            PRIVATELY EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR HIS ACTIONS DURING THE MID-EAST
                            DEBATE AND FOR HIS RECENT DESCRIPTION OF FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND
                            TRI-PARTITISM AS TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE ILO (HE CLAIMED HE WAS
                            CRITICIZED BY THE SOVIETS FOR THAT). I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE
                            POSITION OF FRANCE, HIS COUNTRY, WOULD BE OF PARTICULAR
                            SIGNIFICANCE.</p>
                        <p>9. COMMENT: THERE WAS NO PURPOSE IN COMING ON STRONG WITH BLANCHARD. THE
                            SITUATION PRESENTS INHERENT PRESSURE. I THOUGHT IT MORE USEFUL TO
                            REFLECT A SORROWFUL, DOWN-BEAT ATTITUDE TO ADD TO OUR CREDIBILITY.
                            FURTHERMORE, I DID NOT DISCUSS IN DETAIL OUR 76-77 AGENDA BECAUSE I DID
                            NOT WANT TO IMPLICITLY SANCTION BLANCHARD AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN U.S. AND
                            OTHER ILO MEMBERS. HE IS, OF COURSE, INFORMED OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH
                            OTHER COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY FRANCE, AND WILL SURELY POSE AS A
                            SOPHISTICATED EXPERT ON THE U.S. POSITIONS BUT THE MORE OFF BALANCE THE
                            MORE HE IS WORRIED AND THAT ITSELF WILL HAVE A SALUTARY IMPACT ON HIS
                            ACTIONS, THE ACTIONS OF HIS OFFICE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ON THE
                            EUROPEANS WITH WHOM HE IS IN CONSTANT CONTACT. <persName

                        <p>"DEAR MR. DIRECTOR GENERAL:</p>
                        <p>I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER OF FEBRUARY 10, 1976, REQUESTING
                            EARLY PAYMENT OF THE SUMS OWED TO THE ORGANIZATION BY THE UNITED
                            STATES.</p>
                        <p>I FULLY APPRECIATE THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR UNESCO OF THE NONPAYMENT
                            OF THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTION. IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
                            HOWEVER, GIVEN THE INABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE THE CERTIFICATION
                            REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT
                            OF 1974, I MUST TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CONTINUE TO
                            WITHHOLD PAYMENT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT AMENDMENT, CONGRESS DIRECTED
                            THAT "...NO FUNDS SHOULD BE OBLIGATED OR EXPENDED, DIRECTLY OR
                            INDIRECTLY, TO SUPPORT THE UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND
                            CULTURAL ORGANIZATION UNTIL THE PRESIDENT CERTIFIES TO THE CONGRESS THAT
                            SUCH ORGANIZATION (1) HAS ADOPTED POLICIES WHICH ARE FULLY CONSISTENT
                            WITH ITS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL OBJECTIVES, AND (2) HAS
                            TAKEN CONCRETE STEPS TO CORRECT ITS RECENT ACTIONS OF A PRIMARILY
                            POLITICAL CHARACTER."</p>
                        <p>AS YOU KNOW, THIS AMENDMENT WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS IN
                            DECEMBER 1975 IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACTS OF THE
                            18TH GENERAL CONFERENCE OF UNESCO, DIRECTED AGAINST ISRAEL, WHICH
                            AROUSED CONSIDERABLE INDIGNATION IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
                        <p>BECAUSE OF OUR STRONG DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A FULL ROLE IN SUPPORT OF
                            THE GOALS FOR WHICH UNESCO STANDS, WE HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE
                            EFFORTS MADE AT RECENT SESSIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, DUE IN PART TO
                            YOUR CAPABLE LEADERSHIP, TO AVOID FURTHER POLITICIZATION. WE WERE ALSO
                            GRATIFIED BY THE WELCOME STEPS THE BOARD TOOK TOWARD REVERSING THE
                            GENERAL CONFERENCE DECISION WHICH EXCLUDED ISRAEL FROM MEMBERSHIP IN
                            UNESCOS REGIONAL GROUPS.</p>
                        <p>I HOPE THAT THE 19TH GENERAL CONFERENCE WILL BUILD UPON THESE ENCOURAGING
                            BEGINNINGS AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE CREATION OF CONDITIONS
                            UNDER WHICH THE UNITED STATES COULD RESUME ITS PAYMENTS TO UNESCO.</p>
                        <p>YOUR LETTER ALSO REFERS TO YOUR APPEAL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HELP DEFRAY
                            THE ADDED EXPENSE OF HOLDING THE 19TH GENERAL CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI,
                            KENYA. WHILE WE CONCURRED IN THE DECISION TO HOLD THE 19TH GENERAL
                            CONFERENCE IN NAIROBI, WE DID SO WITHOUT COMMITTING OURSELVES TO
                            FINANCIAL SUPPORT. IT IS OUR POLICY THAT THE EXTRA EXPENSES OF ANY
                            CONFERENCE HELD AWAY FROM HEADQUARTERS SHOULD BE BORNE BY THE HOST
                            GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENT TO THE 1974 FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
                            ACT NOTED ABOVE WOULD APPEAR RELEVANT IN THIS SITUATION. WE HAVE ALREADY
                            INFORMED THE GOVERNMENT OF KENYA THAT WE WILL NOT MAKE A
                            CONTRIBUTION.</p>
                        <p>I TRUST THAT THESE CLARIFICATIONS WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU.</p>

                        <p>3. ON NOVEMBER 6, 1975, US FILED NOTICE OF INTENT TO WITHDRAW FROM ILO IN
                            TWO YEARS UNLESS CERTAIN OBJECTIONABLE TRENDS REVERSED (REF A). IN LAST
                            FEW MONTHS US PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY AMBASSADOR LAURENCE SILBERMAN HAS
                            VISITED CAPITALS OF KEY INDUSTRIAL ILO MEMBERS TO EXPLAIN OUR CONCERNS
                            AND SEEK THEIR SUPPORT IN HALTING OR REVERSING OBJECTIONABLE TRENDS.
                            (REF B) WE CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF ILO BE REMINDED
                            OF OUR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME SINCE THERE WILL BE TWO KEY ILO CONFERENCES
                            IN JUNE--ANNUAL CONFERENCE FROM JUNE 2 TO 23 AND SPECIAL WORLD
                            EMPLOYMENT CONFERENCE FROM JUNE 4 TO 17. DEVELOPMENTS AT THESE TWO
                            CONFERENCES WILL CONSTITUTE IMPORTANT TESTS IN EYES OF <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> OF POSSIBILITY FOR HALTING OR REVERSING
                            TRENDS WHICH LAY BEHIND US NOTICE OF INTENT TO WITHDRAW. OUTCOME OF BOTH
                            CONFERENCES WILL INEVITABLY AFFECT US THINKING RE FUTURE PARTICIPATION
                            IN ILO.</p>
                        <p>4. WHEN DISCUSSING US CONCERN RE EROSION OF TRIPARTISM (WORKER,
                            MANAGEMENT, GOVERNMENT), WHICH CONSTITUTES ILO'S UNIQUENESS, POSTS
                            SHOULD NOTE THERE WILL BE TWO RELEVANT ISSUES AT UPCOMING CONFERENCES.
                            FIRST IS ELECTION OF OFFICERS TO IMPORTANT CONFERENCE POSTS--CHAIRMAN OF
                            GOVERNING BOARD, PRESIDENT OF ANNUAL CONFERENCE, CHAIRMAN OF WORLD
                            EMPLOYMENT CONFERENCE AND CHAIRMAN OF <gloss target="#t_WEC1"
                                >WEC</gloss> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE, AS WELL AS CHAIRMAN OF MARITIME
                            SESSION OF ILO CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER. WE CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL THAT
                            THESE POSTS BE FILLED BY NATIONALS OF COUNTRIES WITH GENUINE BELIEF IN
                            AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE TRIPARTITE NATURE OF ILO. SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE
                            OPPOSED TO ELECTION OF ANY EASTERN EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE TO ANY OF
                            THESE POSTS WE PLAN TO SUPPORT. WE SUPPORT THE CANDIDACY OF HASSE
                                (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) FOR CHAIRMAN OF THE <gloss
                                target="#t_GB1">GB</gloss>; O'LEARY (GOVT OF IRELAND) AS PRESIDENT
                            OF ANNUAL CONFERENCE; ENNACEUR (TUNISIAN) AS CHAIRMAN OF WEC, SUBROTO
                            (INDONESIAN) FOR CHAIRMAN OF WEC COMMITTEE OF WHOLE, AND NON-EASTERN
                            EUROPEAN FOR MARITIME SESSION OF ILO CONFERENCE (OCTOBER).</p>
                        <p>5. SECOND ISSUE RELEVANT TO EROSION OF TRIPARTISM IS FUTURE OF DISCUSSION
                            RE STRUCTURE OF ILO, FOR PAST SEVERAL YEARS WORKING PARTY ON STRUCTURE
                            HAS SEEN HOLDING DISCUSSIONS RE POSSIBLE STRUCTURAL CHANGES,
                            SPECIFICALLY/ EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE (PRIMARILY BY EASTERN EUROPEANS) TO
                            ADD GEOGRAPHICAL CRITERIA TO METHOD USED FOR CHOOSING GOVERNMENT MEMBERS
                            OF GOVERNING BODY, WE OBJECT TO THESE EFFORTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IF
                            THIS CHANGE OCCURS' IT WILL LEAD TO EFFORT TO IMPOSE GEOGRAPHICAL
                            CRITERIA ON CHOICE OF WORKER AND EMPLOYER MEMBERS OF GB, WHO ARE NOW
                            CHOSEN AUTONOMOUSLY BY WORKER AND EMPLOYER GROUPS, SUCH CONSTITUTIONAL
                            CHANGE WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS EROSION OF PRESENT AUTONOMY OF TRIPARTITE
                            GROUPS, WE WILL AGREE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS IN WORKING PARTY ON
                            STRUCTURE, IF THIS IS SUGGESTED BY OTHER ILO MEMBERS.</p>
                        <p>6. WHEN DISCUSSING US CONCERN RE POLITICIZATION, POSTS SHOULD NOTE US
                            EXPECTS EFFORTS TO INJECT INTO FORTHCOMING CONFERENCES POLITICAL ISSUES
                            UNRELATED TO BUSINESS OF ILO--INCLUDING GENERAL ARAB/ISRAELI ISSUES.
                            (ARAB POSTS HAVE DISCRETION IN USE OF FOLLOWING) POSTS SHOULD STRESS
                            THAT US, WHILE IT RECOGNIZES SERIOUSNESS OF ARAB/ISRAELI DIFFERENCES
                            (USG IS IN FACT AT VERY CENTER OF EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT SETTLEMENT OF
                            DIFFERENCES), BELIEVES THESE ISSUES ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERN OF <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> BODIES SUCH AS <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> AND GAP BUT IT IS OUR STRONG BELIEF ILO IS NOT PROPER
                            FORUM FOR DEBATING SUCH ISSUES, SUCH DEBATES CAN HAVE NO EFFECT ON
                            ISSUES THEMSELVES AND CONTINUED POLITICIZATION OF ILO TENDS TO DESTROY
                            SUPPORT FOR ILO IN US, INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
                            PROGRAMS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN LDS'S. FOR THESE REASONS,
                            US HOPES ALL ILO MEMBERS ANXIOUS TO MAINTAIN ILO AS EFFECTIVE
                            ORGANIZATION WILL JOIN IN EFFORT TO AVOID INJECTION OF IRRELEVANT
                            POLITICAL QUESTIONS, INCLUDING ARAB-ISRAELI ISSUES, INTO FORTHCOMING ILO
                            CONFERENCES.</p>
                        <p>7. WHEN DISCUSSING US CONCERN RE DUE PROCESS, POSTS SHOULD STRESS
                            IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING ANY REPETITION OR COMPOUNDING OF THE VIOLATION OF
                            DUE PROCESS REPRESENTED BY 1974 RESOLUTION WHICH CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR
                            ALLEGED VIOLATION OF RIGHTS OF ARAB WORKERS IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES,
                            WITHOUT ANY PRIOR INVESTIGATION. (ARAB POSTS HAVE DISCRETION HERE ALSO)
                            WE OBJECT TO BOTH THE CONDEMNATION WITHOUT INVESTIGATION, AND TO THE
                            ILO'S SUBSEQUENT REQUEST TO HAVE THE DIRECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATE
                            ALLEGATIONS INSTEAD OF USING LONG-ESTABLISHED INVESTIGATIVE MACHINERY,
                            FURTHERMORE, WE DOUBT THAT ANY INVESTIGATION BY WHATEVER METHOD, CAN BE
                            IMPARTIAL WHEN IT HAS BEEN PRECEDED BY DECISION TO CONDEMN.</p>
                        <p>8. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE IN TERMS OF EFFECT ON US SUPPORT FOR THE ILO
                            INVOLVES THE "DOUBLE STANDARD", I.E. FAILURE OF ILO CONFERENCE TO CITE
                            SOME COUNTRIES (SUCH AS <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) FOR
                            VIOLATIONS OF ILO CONVENTION 87 CONCERNING FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION OR
                            CONVENTION 29 CONCERNING FORCED LABOR, DESPITE FINDINGS THAT VIOLATIONS
                            EXIST. THIS IS BASIS FOR POINT IN US LETTER CONCERNING SELECTIVE CONCERN
                            FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. US HOPES OTHER ILO MEMBERS WILL PARTICIPATE
                            OBJECTIVELY IN REVIEW OF APPLICATION OF ILO STANDARDS, AND END DOUBLE
                            STANDARD.</p>
                        <p>9. SUMMARY. POSTS SHOULD ASK HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO EXAMINE REASONS
                            WHY THEY PARTICIPATE IN ILO. IF THEY SEE ILO AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR
                            PROMOTING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS THROUGH LABOR STANDARDS AND
                            TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS, THEY
                            SHOULD ALSO WISH TO WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITHIN THE ILO TO HELP
                            ORGANIZATION RETURN TO ITS BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TO ELIMINATE DISTRACTING
                            INFLUENCES WHICH NOW DETRACT FROM ILO EFFECTIVENESS. HOST GOVERNMENT
                            OFFICIALS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT US DELEGATION TO ILO CONFERENCES HOPES
                            TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES IN MORE DETAIL IN GENEVA.

                        <p>B. ILO GOVERNING BODY APPROVED THE STANDING ORDERS FOR WEC IN MARCH 1976.
                            THESE ORDERS ALLOWED FOR OBSERVER STATUS BUT NONE OF THE INTERPRETATIONS
                            FIT THE PLO. IN MAY SESSION OF GOVERNING BODY, ISSUE OF WEC STANDING
                            ORDERS WAS REOPENED AND FOLLOWING STRONG OPPOSITION FROM <gloss

                            THE GOVERNING BODY UPHELD THE ORDERS, AGAIN DENYING PLO RIGHT TO
                            PARTICIPATE AS OBSERVERS IN THE WEC. GOVERNING BODY'S JUNE 4 REVERSAL OF
                            THIS MAY DECISION FOLLOWED REQUEST TO ANNUAL CONFERENCE FROM ILO MEMBERS
                            OF <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> THAT STANDING ORDERS BE AMENDED
                            IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PERMIT PLO TO PARTICIPATE IN WEC.</p>
                        <p>3. RATIONALE FOR U.S. WALKOUT:</p>
                        <p>A. THE U.S. ACTION WAS TAKEN TO DEMONSTRATE OPPOSITION TO DECISIONS OF
                            THE GOVERNING BODY THAT WERE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND MANIFESTLY IN
                            CONFLICT WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ILO. THE WALKOUT IS TEMPORARY; IT IN
                            NO WAY DIMINISHES U.S. DETERMINATION TO WORK WITHIN THE ILO FOR
                            REFORM.</p>
                        <p>B. THE UNDERLYING REASON FOR U.S. OBJECTION TO PLO PARTICIPATION IN ILO
                            PROCEEDINGS IS THAT THE PLO REPRESENTS NEITHER GOVERNMENT, WORKERS NOR
                            EMPLOYERS. IN ADDITION, THE WEC IS A TECHNICAL CONFERENCE IN WHICH
                            PARTISAN POLITICAL ACTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY INAPPROPRIATE.</p>
                        <p>4. DECISION TO WALK OUT OF THE WEC WAS MADE AFTER THOROUGH CONSULTATION
                            WITH U.S. WORKER AND EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS. ALL THREE REPRESENTATIVES
                            ARE FOLLOWING SIMILAR POLICIES.</p>
                        <p>5. IN MAKING ABOVE POINTS, MISSIONS SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT CRITICAL
                            ELEMENT IN U.S. DECISION WAS A) LONG STANDING U.S. OPPOSITION TO

                        <p>Subject: Angola's Application for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Membership</p>
                        <p>Angola is renewing its bid for membership in the UN. When application was
                            originally made in early May, we succeeded in gaining postponement when
                            we indicated that we would veto the application. The other Security
                            Council members supported postponement because they concluded that the
                            question of Angola membership is a difficult one to deal with during the
                            heat of a Presidential primary campaign.</p>
                        <p>This time, the Angolans have told the British they will press their
                            application through to completion. The other Africans feel bound to
                            support the application.</p>
                        <p>The operative factors in the situation are:</p>
                        <p>--If the application comes up now in the Security Council all other
                            members (including the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, Italy
                            and Japan) will vote in favor.</p>
                        <p>--A U.S. veto will be taken as a slap at the Africans and will burden
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SWW2">Scranton</persName>'s current trip
                            to Africa where he hopes to build on what has been achieved over the
                            past month. A veto will also make it harder for us to round-up the black
                            African votes we may need on such issues as Puerto Rico and Israeli
                            suspension.</p>
                        <p>--Cuban combat troops remain in Angola and appear to be the main prop of
                            the Neto Government. Troop withdrawals, if any, have been negligible.
                            Abstaining in the Council and permitting Angolan membership could be
                            read as a sign of acquiescence in continued Cuban military presence.</p>
                        <p>The following courses seem open to U.S.:</p>
                        <p>--Seeking a further postponement, perhaps to the second half of August.
                            In my judgment, we could gain such postponement only if we assured the
                            members of the Security Council that we will at that time abstain.</p>
                        <p>--Let the matter come up for a vote now and veto the Angolan application.
                            We could say that we would be willing to reconsider the application once
                            conditions change.</p>
                        <p>--We could also let the matter come up now and abstain, allowing approval
                            of Angola's application.</p>
                        <p>My recommendation is that we try for postponement, assuring that in the
                            end we will abstain. We could at the same time seek from the Angolans
                            assurances of net Cuban withdrawals and observe those withdrawals.</p>

                        <p>Results of the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> Conferences</p>
                        <p>The early returns on our efforts to mobilize support from our industrial
                            allies on ILO matters have been impressive, if not yet conclusive. We
                            achieved nearly all of our objectives at two important conferences held
                            last month in Geneva--the ILO General Conference and the World
                            Employment Conference. We also managed to hold divisive political issues
                            to a minimum and to keep the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> delegations on the defensive.</p>
                        <p>The ILO's s stem of tripartism proved to be stronger than the tendency of
                            the <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> and Communist countries to
                            engage in bloc voting. The concerted efforts of the worker and employer
                            groups, in support of the industrialized countries' positions were of
                            primary importance in fracturing these usually strong voting blocs. Also
                            responsible for the lack of unity between these countries was the quiet
                            resentment among many G-77 countries for the heavy-handed way a few G-77
                            governments (particularly Cuba, Mexico and Algeria) tried to manipulate
                            the entire group.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this disunity, political issues did not play a major role
                            in the work of either conference. Although the <gloss target="#t_PLO1"
                                >PLO</gloss> was granted observer status in the <gloss
                                target="#t_WEC1">WEC</gloss>, a PLO representative addressed the WEC
                            plenary on only one occasion, during which the entire US delegation
                            withdrew from the hall.</p>
                        <p>The USSR was criticized and the Soviet bloc was rebuffed in the General
                            Conference. The Committee on the Application of Conventions took the
                            Soviets to task for the way they implement ILO Conventions on Forced
                            Labor and Freedom of Association. The Committee's report "sharply
                            requests" the Soviet Government "to come to grips with specific
                            questions" raised by the Committee on these issues. The East European
                            bloc was further rebuffed by a refusal of the General Conference's
                            Resolutions Committee to consider three political resolutions submitted
                            by a coalition of Communist worker delegates. This result was achieved
                            through a boycott of Committee sessions by non-Communist worker groups
                            and a decision not to participate by other non-Communist representatives
                            including the US Government Delegation.</p>
                        <p>Other developments at the Conferences included:</p>
                        <p>--the failure (for lack of a quorum) of the General Conference to accept
                            a minority report of the Credentials Committee which called for the
                            rejection of the credentials of the Chilean Worker Delegation. The US
                            Government and Employer delegates, along with most European and Latin
                            American government delegates, abstained on this issue while the US
                            Worker delegate voted in favor of invalidation.</p>
                        <p>--the unanimous adoption of a draft resolution by the Workers Group
                            condemning apartheid and calling for an international trade union
                            conference against apartheid in 1977. However, no formal ILO resolution
                            was passed.</p>
                        <p>-- the absence of an expected G-77 call for a constitutional convention
                            to "democratize the ILO," a convention which would almost certainly have
                            pressed for amendments diluting both tripartism and the relative power
                            of the most advanced industrialized states while simultaneously
                            introducing regionalism into ILO procedures. The G-77 lacked the
                            necessary support to transfer power from the ILO Governing Body (where
                            the US has a stronger influence) to the General Conference which is
                            dominated by the G-77.</p>
                        <p>The AFL-CIO and the US Government delegation were both pleasantly
                            surprised and encouraged by the Conference results. Although our
                            assessment of recent ILO developments should probably be considered
                            "cautiously favorable", American efforts to reform the organization and
                            to round up support among industrialized countries for US positions do
                            appear to be meeting with some success. Such efforts should be
                            maintained as we further consider the question of continued US
                            participation in the ILO.</p>

                        <p>1. AT THE INITIATIVE OF IRAQ (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss>),
                            THE IAEA GENERAL CONFERENCE WHICH WILL MEET IN RIO DE JANEIRO FROM
                            SEPTEMBER 21 TO 28 WILL CONSIDER EXTENDING AN INVITATION TO "PLO, AS
                            REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE" TO ATTEND AS OBSERVER. AS
                            JUSTIFICATION, THE INVITATION CITES THE NEED OR PALESTINIAN KNOWLEDGE OF
                            NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF "AGGRESSIVE DESIGNS OF ISRAEL." THE
                            INVITATION HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AS A CONFERENCE DOCUMENT AND HAS BEEN
                            ADDED TO THE PROVISIONAL AGENDA.</p>
                        <p>2. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE EXTENDING SUCH AN INVITATION TO THE PLO AND PLAN
                            VIGOROUSLY TO CONTEST THE ISSUE AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE ON THE
                            FOLLOWING GROUNDS:</p>
                        <p>-- CONSTITUTIONALLY, THE IAEA RULES OF PROCEDURE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR
                            OBSERVER STATUS FOR ENTITIES SUCH AS THE PLO;</p>
                        <p>-- THE MOVE IS STRICTLY POLITICAL IN NATURE. IT IS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE
                            THE POLITICAL STATURE OF THE PLO. THE PLO HAS NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO
                            THE IAEA NOR CAN THE IAEA CONTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY TO THE PLO.</p>
                        <p>-- IN THE CASE OF THE IAEA, SUCH AN ACT OF POLITICIZATION IS ESPECIALLY
                            REGRETTABLE. IT INEVITABLY WILL DIMINISH CONFIDENCE IN THE IAEA AS A
                            TECHNICAL BODY IN THE SAFEGUARDS FIELD. EXTENDING OBSERVER STATUS TO THE
                            PLO WILL, IN OUR VIEW, ADD AN ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION TO EFFORTS AT
                            EMPLOYING THE IAEA AS ONE OF THE MAJOR GUARANTORS OF
                            NON-PROLIFERATION.</p>
                        <p>3. FOR THE HAGUE: EMBASSY SHOULD BRIEF THE DUTCH, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS
                            PRESIDENT OF THE EC-9, ON OUR POSITION (DRAWING ON PARAS 1 AND 2 ABOVE).
                            YOU SHOULD ASK THE DUTCH TO BRING THE ISSUE TO THE ATTENTION OF THEIR
                            COLLEAGUES IN THE NINE. YOU SHOULD URGE THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE NINE
                            AND STATE THAT WE REMAIN PREPARED TO COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS WITH
                            THEIRS.</p>
                        <p>4. FOR BONN, BRUSSELS, COPENHAGEN, LONDON, LUXEMBOURG, OSLO, PARIS, ROME:
                            EMBASSIES SHOULD BRIEF FOREIGN MINISTRIES ON THE PROBLEM AS WE FORESEE
                            IT AND ON OUR INTENTION TO OPPOSE THE ADMISSION OF THE PLO AS OBSERVER.
                            EMBASSIES SHOULD ADD THAT WE WISH TO COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS WITH THOSE
                            OF THE NINE AND WE HAVE ASKED THE DUTCH, AS CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE
                            NINE, TO RAISE THE MATTER ON OUR BEHALF.</p>
                        <p>5. FOR BERN, BOGOTA, BANGKOK, CANBERRA, DUBLIN, HELSINKI, MADRID,
                            MONTEVIDEO, OTTAWA, SAN JOSE, SANTIAGO, STOCKHOLM, WELLINGTON, USMISSION
                            GENEVA: EMBASSIES SHOULD APPROACH FOREIGN MINISTRIES, BRIEF THEM ON
                            ISSUE AS WE ASSESS IT AND, DRAWING ON PARAS 1 AND 2 ABOVE, URGE THEIR
                            SUPPORT OF OUR EFFORTS IN THE FORTHCOMING GENERAL CONFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>6. FOR USMISSION IAEA: AT YOUR DISCRETION, WE SUGGEST THAT YOU BRIEF THE
                            IAEA SECRETARIAT OF OUR CONCERN. WITHOUT GOING INTO ANY DETAILS ON WHAT
                            WE PROPOSE IN THE WAY OF DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE, YOU MAY INFORM THE
                            SECRETARIAT THAT WE DO INTEND TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF THE MATTER; THAT WE
                            ARE SEEKING WIDE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION TO THE IRAQI INITIATIVE; AND THAT
                            WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY COUNSEL OR ADVICE THEY MIGHT FEEL FREE TO GIVE
                            US ON HOW MOST EFFECTIVELY TO PROCEED. AT THE IAEA SECRETARIAT, YOU
                            MIGHT STRESS OUR CONCERN THAT TO ADMIT THE PLO AS AN OBSERVER INEVITABLY
                            WOULD DIMINISH PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE IAEA AS AN INSTITUTION WHICH CAN
                            OBJECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAUSE OF NON-PROLIFERATION.</p>
                        <p>7. FOR TEL AVIV: YOU SHOULD BRIEF GOI ON THE EFFORT WE ARE MAKING. YOU
                            SHOULD ASK THEIR VIEWS ON HOW WE MIGHT MOST PERSUASIVELY PRESS OUR CASE
                            AND ASK WHAT COUNTRIES MIGHT MOST READILY BE WILLING TO JOIN US IN THE
                            EFFORT. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>

                        <p>The Problem</p>
                        <p>In several <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Specialized Agencies and the
                                <gloss target="#t_IAEA1">IAEA</gloss>, the Socialist Republic of
                            Vietnam (SRV) has indicated that following reunification it plans to
                            succeed to the former South Vietnamese seat held initially by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and later acceded to by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRGSV1">PRG</gloss>. We must decide what position and
                            actions we take as the principal bodies of various Specialized Agencies
                            consider this issue over the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Background/Analysis </p>
                        <p>Unlike the case of SRV application for <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> membership, there is no realistic prospect of keeping
                            Hanoi out of these agencies. Nor can we expect any significant support
                            for any attempt on our part to delay or obstruct SRV entry. We did not
                            object last year to PRG accession to the GVN seat in several
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>In regard to a regional <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> meeting in
                            August, you indicated that we should not make an issue of SRV seating.
                            We stated at that meeting that the membership question should be decided
                            through proper procedures at the full General Conference rather than a
                            regional sub-body. We have also indicated this position elsewhere. The
                            first such General Conference comes up at the International Atomic
                            Energy Agency on September 21.</p>
                        <p>In a meeting on August 17 you decided that we should abstain in any votes
                            on membership in the International Financial Institutions (<gloss
                                target="#t_IFI1">IFI</gloss>'s), although we understand you have
                            since agreed with Treasury to vote “no" at the IMP Board of Governors
                            meeting September 15. We expect to be out-voted in any case.</p>
                        <p>In keeping with your decision on the FAO regional conference, referred to
                            above, we continue to believe there is nothing to be gained from making
                            an issue of SRV membership or provoking unnecessary debate on it in the
                            various Agencies, where we have no veto. We are :making our objections
                            clear where it counts, i.e., in the Security Council, and we see no
                            point in making vain tries elsewhere to exclude or obstruct SRV entry.
                            However, we also believe we should not imply approval of Viet-Nam's
                            membership, but rather, in the General Conferences or other principal
                            bodies of the Specialized Agencies, we should use whatever vote or other
                            opportunity which arises to record our reservations on the
                            issue--including our concern (in cases where this is relevant) that
                            proper procedures be followed and our doubts whether the record of the
                            SRV demonstrates its willingness to carry out obligations it
                            undertakes.</p>
                        <p>Membership will, of course, confer both obligations and benefits on the
                            SRV. IAEA membership will, for example, subject the SRV to controls and
                            safeguards on the small medical research reactor which they acquired in
                            South Vietnam (and from which we removed the fuel before the fall of
                            Saigon). On the other hand, membership in any UN Specialized Agency will
                            qualify the SRV for <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss> assistance,
                            which might include projects totaling as much as $49 million (which had
                            been committed to the GVN in the past) over the next few years. Our
                            general approach so far in regard to aid to the PRG (which succeeded to
                            the GVN seat last year) has been not to object but to try to assure that
                            any such aid should be only undertaken properly under normal Agency
                            procedures and in reasonable amounts. We of course continue to state
                            that we would not participate in any special or voluntary programs for
                            Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The Options </p>
                        <p>Option 1: Abstain on any vote (or reserve on any consensus decision) on
                            the issue, but without making a dissenting statement.</p>
                        <p>PRO</p>
                        <p>--Would be most straightforward position and would avoid necessity for
                            unconvincing argumentation in situation where we will almost certainly
                            be the lone dissenter.</p>
                        <p>CON</p>
                        <p>--To the extent we wish to indicate our disapproval of SRV membership and
                            disassociate ourselves clearly from the agency decision, this would be
                            the least forceful way of doing so.</p>
                        <p>Option 2: Abstain on any vote (or reserve on any consensus decision) on
                            the issue. State in low key that we believe matter deserves further
                            consideration and clearer indication of SRV willingness to abide by
                            obligations of membership.</p>
                        <p>PRO</p>
                        <p>--This would clearly record and demonstrate our reservations about SRV
                            membership without being too contentious about it. It would be a
                            relatively forthcoming position in comparison with our probable Security
                            Council veto, showing we are not engaged in a vendetta to block SRV
                            participation in the international community everywhere.</p>
                        <p>CON</p>
                        <p>--It might appear inconsistent with our Security Council stand. It might
                            portray a somewhat more forthcoming attitude toward the SRV than we wish
                            to show at this time.</p>
                        <p>Option 3: Vote “no” (or express strong reservation) on the issue where
                            voting is the customary procedure. Explain our position in stronger
                            terms than above.</p>
                        <p>PRO</p>
                        <p>--This would be more consistent with our planned Security Council
                            position and your decision to vote no in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>. It would extend our attitude of disapproval of SRV
                            membership to other agencies, even though we cannot actually prevent its
                            entry.</p>
                        <p>CON</p>
                        <p>--It would isolate us almost completely and underline further our
                            inability to affect the outcome. It would be widely criticized as a
                            "dog-in-the-manger" attitude toward the SRV.</p>
                        <p>Option 4: Force a vote and vote "no" even when voting would be contrary
                            to normal procedure, as is the case in many specialized agencies.</p>
                        <p>PRO</p>
                        <p>--This would indicate in the strongest terms our disapproval of SRV
                            entry.</p>
                        <p>CON </p>
                        <p>--It would be a highly confrontational stand and subject us to severe
                            criticism even from our friends.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                        <p>We recommend Option 2, Abstain on any vote (or reserve on any consensus
                            decision) on the issue in UN Specialized Agencies and other
                            international bodies. State in low key that we believe matter deserves
                            further consideration and clearer indication of SRV willingness to abide
                            by obligations of membership.</p>

                            18TH GENERAL CONFERENCE RESOLUTION 11.1</p>
                        <p>1. PROBLEM: A SENEGALESE DRAFT RESOLUTION, APPROVED BY 100TH EXECUTIVE
                            BOARD, RECOMMENDS THAT THE 19TH GENERAL CONFERENCE "TAKE ALL NECESSARY
                            MEASURES WITH A VIEW TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM ACTIVITIES AND MEETINGS OF <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>
                            UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT COUNTRY PUT A STOP TO THEIR
                            POLICY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION." THIS RESOLUTION WILL PROBABLY COME UP
                            UNDER AGENDA ITEM 9.</p>
                        <p>2. POSITION:</p>
                        <p>A) <gloss target="#t_USDEL1">USDEL</gloss> SHOULD OPPOSE ANY INITIATIVES
                            OR PROPOSALS FOR ACTION BY THE CONFERENCE THAT EMANATE FROM THIS
                            RESOLUTION, OR OTHERS WITH THE SAME INTENT, THAT SEEK TO EXCLUDE SOUTH
                            AFRICA FROM THE ACTIVITIES AND MEETINGS OF IOC OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL
                            BODIES RELATED TO UNESCO.</p>
                        <p>B) USDEL MAY EXPLAIN THAT ALTHOUGH THE USA ABHORS THE SOUTH AFRICAN
                            POLICY OF APARTHEID AND HAS CONSISTENTLY SO STATED, THE USA REGARDS THE
                            EXCLUSION OF SOUTH AFRICA FROM THE IOC AS ILLEGAL, IN DENYING THE RIGHT
                            OF PARTICIPATION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF MEMBERSHIP,
                            AND CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY. EXCLUSION OR SUSPENSION
                            WOULD GIVE IMPETUS TO THE INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS TREND OF POLITICIZING
                            THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> SPECIALIZED AGENCIES AND THEIR
                            SUBSIDIARY BODIES, TO THE CONSIDERABLE DETRIMENT OF THE TECHNICAL WORK
                            OF SUCH ORGANIZATION. THEREFORE, THE USA WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE
                            EXCLUSION OF SOUTH AFRICA FROM THE IOC.</p>
                        <p>C) USDEL MAY CALL ATTENTION TO RECENT STATEMENTS MADE BY SECRETARY
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> ON APARTHEID AND
                            POINT OUT THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN
                            STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE MOVEMENT ON PROBLEMS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA
                            (NAMIBIA, RHODESIA). </p>
                        <p>3. DISCUSSION:</p>
                        <p>A) THE 100TH SESSION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD ADOPTED A RESOLUTION
                            RECOMMENDING THAT THE 19TH GENERAL CONFERENCE "TAKE ALL NECESSARY
                            MEASURES WITH A VIEW TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM ACTIVITIES AND MEETINGS OF THE IOC UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE
                            AUTHORITIES OF THAT COUNTRY PUT A STOP TO THEIR POLICY OF RACIAL
                            DISCRIMINATION." THIS RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE GENERAL
                            CONFERENCE UNDER AGENDA ITEM 9 CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
                            RESOLUTION 18 C/11.1, WHICH ASKED MEMBER STATES TO EXCLUDE SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM ALL UNESCO RELATED ACTIVITIES, SINCE THE EXECUTIVE BOARD'S
                            RECOMMENDATION REFERS TO THAT RESOLUTION.</p>
                        <p>B) THE U.S. OPPOSED THE ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION 18 C/11.1 ON THE GROUNDS
                            THAT IT INCREASED THE POLITICIZATION OF THE SPECIALIZED AGENCIES. WE
                            WILL OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPTS TO EXCLUDE SOUTH AFRICA FROM THE IOC ON THE
                            GROUNDS THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF
                            UNIVERSALITY OF MEMBERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION AND NOT DENY MEMBERSHIP OR
                            PARTICIPATION ON POLITICAL GROUNDS.</p>
                        <p>C) AT THE 9TH SESSION OF THE IOC ASSEMBLY, THE AFRICANS INSCRIBED A
                            RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE GENERAL CONFERENCE TO EXCLUDE SOUTH AFRICA
                            FROM THE IOC UNDER THE LAST AGENDA ITEM DEALING WITH THE DATE AND PLACE
                            OF THE NEXT ASSEMBLY. DISCUSSION ON PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THIS
                            RESOLUTION DELAYED ITS CONSIDERATION UNTIL THE TIME SCHEDULED FOR THE
                            MEETING TO END, AT WHICH TIME THE CHAIRMAN GAVELED THE FINAL MEETING TO
                            A CLOSE, TO THE FURY OF THE AFRICAN DELEGATION. THE CHAIRMAN'S ACTION IN
                            ENDING THE MEETING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PROTESTED BY A GROUP OF COUNTRIES.
                            THE 7TH IOC EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (JUNE 1976) AGREED THAT THE NEXT ASSEMBLY
                            WILL BE HELD IN PARIS IN NOVEMBER 1977. THERE WAS NO FURTHER DISCUSSION
                            OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN QUESTION.</p>

                            this time, the Secretary is reported still to be "thinking about it." He
                            will presumably consult the President before making a final decision. I
                            take the liberty of bringing this to your attention in advance.</p>
                        <p>The case being made by Governor Scranton and by State for an abstention
                            is fairly strong:</p>
                        <p>--We shall need to veto a string of resolutions in the Security Council
                            in the near future, presumably including Vietnam's membership
                            application early next week and several resolutions on South Africa and
                            apartheid. To add an Angola membership veto to these will increase our
                            difficulties in getting support on other United Nations issues in the
                            final few weeks of the 31st General Assembly. Even our friends in Africa
                            are pushing us not to veto.</p>
                        <p>--The legal grounds for a veto are thin. Angola is as "able and willing"
                            as many member states to carry out the obligations of the United Nations
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>--As far as we know, no other Permanent Member of the Security Council
                            will veto this application.</p>
                        <p>-- Angola is one of the "front-line" states concerned with Rhodesian and
                            Namibian negotiations and might be less inclined to radical solutions
                            there if it were not kept out of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>--We made the case against Angolan membership primarily because of the
                            presence there of massive numbers of Cuban troops. While they are still
                            there, they have not so far operated against any other southern African
                            country. An abstention is not an endorsement of their continued
                            presence, but an acceptance of the inevitable. </p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION: </p>
                        <p>That you sign the attached memorandum to the President at TAB I
                            recommending that he support a United States abstention in the United
                            Nations Security Council on the admission of Angola to <gloss

                            OF MEMBERSHIP APPLICATIONS. THE USSR (AMBASSADOR KHARLAMOV) TOOK A
                            FAMILIAR LINE OF DEFENSE BY CLAIMING THAT THE SOVIET VETOES HAD COME
                            DURING ANOTHER UN ERA, BUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE U.N. WERE MUCH
                            DIFFERENT NOW.</p>

                            OUR USE OF THE VETO, COMMUNIST AND NON-ALIGNED SPEAKERS CONTINUED TO
                            CLAIM THAT WE WERE CONFUSING A BILATERAL ISSUE WITH A MULTILATERAL ONE
                            BY CONNECTING THE <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss> QUESTION TO

                        <p>4. VIETNAM, IN THANKING 14 UNSC MEMBERS FOR VOTING IN ITS FAVOR, SAID IT
                            HOPED FOR FUTURE SUPPORT OF MANY UN MEMBERS IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THIS
                            WOULD APPEAR TO UNDERLINE THE PROBABILITY THAT ISSUE OF VIETNAM'S
                            MEMBERSHIP AGAIN WILL BE RAISED IN PLENARY AS IT WAS IN 1975.</p>

                        <p>You may find the following information useful for your meeting with Mr.
                            Horowitz on December 3.</p>
                        <p>1. Status Report on Our Relations with the ILO</p>
                        <p>The two-year notice period of our intention to withdraw from the ILO ends
                            November 6, 1977 and we expect to make our decision about staying in or
                            getting out after the annual ILO conference in June 1977. The major
                            issues at that conference will probably be the handling of the
                            Arab-Israeli problem (see paragraph 2 below) and the success of our
                            effort to amend Article 17 of the ILO Standing Orders to prevent
                            introduction of political resolutions.</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet-level Committee (<gloss target="#t_CLC1">CLC</gloss>),
                            chaired by the Secretary of Labor, will meet January 4, 1977, to assess
                            developments of the last six months. At the July 21 meeting of the CLC,
                            Lane Kirkland, Vice President of the AFL-CIO, said that we were no
                            nearer to a decision to stay in the ILO than we had been when we decided
                            a year earlier to send the letter of intent to withdraw. He added that
                            at best it was 50-50 whether we would stay in or get out.</p>
                        <p>A tough and perhaps unanswerable question is whether the support our
                            reform effort has received from Western democracies (all of whom want us
                            to stay in the ILO) is primarily a reaction to our threat to withdraw,
                            or whether it represents genuine agreement with our objectives which
                            will continue if the threat of withdrawal disappears. It would be
                            unfortunate for our relations with the ILO, with other members of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> system, and with our Western
                            allies if we in the ILO and then were confronted with the same lack of
                            support on matters of principle which led us to give notice of intent to
                            withdraw. This question has been discussed informally by Mr. Horowitz
                            with some Western governments but there is presumably no way to find out
                            what is the underlying motivation for the support they have been giving
                            us.</p>
                        <p>2. Results of the November 1976 Governing Body (<gloss target="#t_GB1"
                                >GB</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>A. Setback for US. The US suffered a serious setback in its efforts to
                            bring to an end the Director General's (<gloss target="#t_DG1"
                                >DG</gloss>) involvement in investigating Arab charges of Israeli
                            discrimination against Arab workers in the occupied territories.
                            (Background: The June 1974 conference passed a resolution condemning
                            Israel and asking the DG to correct the situation. Since that time the
                            DG has been collecting information and reporting to the Governing Body.
                            The U.S. position is: the resolution was a denial of due process,
                            investigation which comes after condemnation is a tainted procedure; and
                            the Governing Body should decide to drop the whole matter.) At our
                            suggestion, the DG's report to the November session of the GB stated he
                            could do nothing further, and the officers of the Governing Body
                            endorsed his recommendation to close the book.</p>
                        <p>We had sufficient support from the workers, the employers, and Western
                            government representatives to achieve our objective, but at the last
                            minute the Arabs requested the whole issue be postponed. They put
                            pressure on the employers (who are always sensitive to Arab
                            initiatives), and all but the US employer agreed to postponement.
                            Without their support, there was no possibility of getting a vote in the
                            Governing Body which would close the book, and the Western government
                            representatives proved unwilling to stand with us when they knew we
                            would be defeated. (This contrasts with their willingness to stand with
                            us in defeat in June 1976 in opposing observer status for the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> at the World Employment Conference)
                            This attitude and the last-minute collapse of the employer group caught
                            us by surprise and we reluctantly acquiesced in the postponement. The
                            Arabs now have time to muster <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss>
                            support for anti-Israeli moves at the next GB session in February or,
                            worse still, postpone the issue once more until the June 1977
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>B. Sri Lankan Threat. Another startling event at the November GB was a
                            35-minute polemic by the Sri Lankan Government representative "on behalf
                            of the G-77" in which he said the G-77 countries can negotiate from a
                            position of strength now that they have nuclear weapons. (We have
                            received the verbatim transcript of his remarks on a very confidential
                            basis from the ILO Secretariat--and are considering what action should
                            be taken.)</p>
                        <p>3. Results of Mr. Horowitz' Asian Trip</p>
                        <p>The Cabinet-level Committee decided July 21, 1976 to reach out to
                            developing country members of the ILO by having Mr. Horowitz conduct
                            consultations similar toy those held earlier this year with
                            industrialized countries by Special Presidential Envoy, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SLH1">Silberman</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The first round involved visits to Israel, Iran, India, Pakistan, Sri
                            Lanka, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In terms of
                            the issues discussed during his October visits, he got the following
                            reactions:</p>
                        <p>a. US in the ILO. Each country urged us to stay in. Most expressed "full
                            agreement in principle" with the US on ILO issues and an intention to
                            work to preserve the ILO from further debilitation and to keep the US
                            in. There were no commitments made to us, however--not even to vote with
                            the US should controversial political issues arise in the ILO despite
                            efforts to keep them out.</p>
                        <p>b. Revision of Article 17. Mr. Horowitz argued in favor of changing the
                            standing orders of the ILO conference to exclude irrelevant and
                            unsubstantiated condemnatory resolutions. The best reaction (Iran) was a
                            promise of "sympathetic consideration"; others, were more blunt (e.g.
                            India), stating this idea would go nowhere, that the US must be
                            "realistic", and that the diversity of interests in the ILO required
                            "flexibility" on our part.</p>
                        <p>4. Plans for Mr. Horowitz' African Trip </p>
                        <p>The next round is scheduled for Africa January 8-30, with stops in Sedan,
                            Kenya, Swabia, Tanzania, Zaire, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia,
                            Sierra Leone and Senegal. Subsequent trips to Latin America, the Middle
                            East and Europe are projected.</p>

                        <p>2. THE NINETEENTH GENERAL CONFERENCE OF UNESCO MET IN NAIROBI FROM
                            OCTOBER 26 TO NOVEMBER 30. OUTCOME WAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO US
                            BECAUSE IT WOULD LARGELY DETERMINE EXTENT TO WHICH US WOULD BE ABLE TO
                            CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN UNESCO ACTIVITIES. FOLLOWING THE 18TH GENERAL
                            CONFERENCE IN 1974 AT WHICH SEVERAL ANTI-ISRAELI DECISIONS HAD BEEN
                            TAKEN, THE US CONGRESS DECIDED TO WITHHOLD THE US CONTRIBUTION TO UNESCO
                            UNTIL CONCRETE STEPS WERE TAKEN TO CORRECT THESE DECISIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. OF THE FOUR KEY ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE CONFERENCE, THREE
                            RELATED TO ISRAEL: ADMISSION OF ISRAEL TO THE EUROPEAN GROUP; ISRAELI
                            EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL PRACTICES IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES; AND
                            JERUSALEM EXCAVATIONS. THE FOURTH ISSUE WAS THE SOVIET-INSPIRED DRAFT
                            DECLARATION ON THE MASS MEDIA. RESULTS WERE, ON BALANCE, POSITIVE
                            ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE BY NO MEANS COMPLETELY REVERSED ALL ITS EARLIER
                            POSITIONS. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. DUE TO VOTING METHOD AT

                            REGION RECTIFIED 1974 GC REJECTION OF ISRAEL, WHICH WAS A KEY FACTOR IN
                            CONGRESSIONAL CUT-OFF OF FUNDS TO UNESCO. B) SOVIET DRAFT MASS MEDIA

                        <p>D) OVERALL, CONFERENCE DEVOTED LESS TIME THAN IN PAST TO CONTENTIOUS
                            DEBATES ON ISSUES. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE IN LARGE MEASURE TO DG M'BOW,

                        <p>5. NEGATIVE RESULTS: CONFERENCE REAFFIRMED TWO RESOLUTIONS FROM 18TH GC
                            HIGHLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL. A) FIRST RESOLUTION ATTACKED ISRAELI
                            EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL POLICIES IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES PRIOR TO
                            FACTUAL INVESTIGATION. B) SECOND CRITICIZED ISRAELI ARCHEOLOGICAL DIGS
                            IN JERUSALEM, ALLEGED HARM TO CITY'S HISTORICAL CHARACTER, AND EXTENDED
                            1974 CUT-OFF UNESCO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS. EVEN IN THESE CASES,
                            HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF MODERATION: ARAB HARD-LINERS WERE
                            UNSUCCESSFUL IN PUSHING HARSHER RESOLUTIONS (WHICH WOULD HAVE EXPANDED
                            THE SANCTIONS AGAINST ISRAEL FOR ITS ALLEGEDLY HARMFUL ACTIVITIES IN
                            JERUSALEM), AND THE PLENARY VOTES AGAINST ISRAEL WERE MARGINALLY
                            IMPROVED OVER THE COMMISSION VOTES AS A RESULT OF AFRICAN
                            ABSENCES/ABSTENTIONS. (ON THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, THE VOTE AGAINST
                            ISRAEL WAS REDUCED FROM 73-6(US)-30 TO 61-5(US)-28 AND FROM 70-25(US)-14
                            TO 61-19(US)-16 ON JERUSALEM.)</p>
                        <p>6. ASSESSMENT: A) OVERALL RESULTS WERE STRIKINGLY CLOSE TO INITIAL
                            PREDICTIONS FOR CONFERENCE. IT CLEAR AFRICANS WILLING TO FOLLOW M'BOW,
                            OFTEN IN FACE STRONG SOVIET-<gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss> AND
                            RADICAL ARAB OPPOSITION. OBJECTIVES WERE APPARENTLY TO SEE US FUNDING
                            RESTORED AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF FIRST GC IN AFRICA WITH AFRICAN
                            DG.</p>
                        <p>B) IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE OF M'BOW, PROCEDURAL MANEUVERS HE DEVISED TO
                            MUTE DIVISIVENESS, AFRICAN SUPPORT OF HIM, AND ACTIVE US
                            REPRESENTATIONS, ARAB HARD-LINERS OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL PUSHING
                            PARTICULARLY HARSH RESOLUTIONS, SUCH AS EXPANDING SANCTIONS AGAINST
                            ISRAEL FOR ALLEGEDLY HARMFUL ACTIVITIES IN JERUSALEM. </p>
                        <p>C) DESPITE CONFERENCE CRITICISM OF ISRAEL, MEDIA COVERAGE IN NAIROBI AND
                            EDITORIAL COMMENT IN US BASICALLY POSITIVE TOWARD GC AND UNESCO. IN MANY
                            INSTANCES, POSITIVE REACTION EXTENDED TO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESUMPTION
                            OF US CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ORGANIZATION.</p>
                        <p>7. ON BALANCE, IT APPARENT FROM GC RESULTS THAT MANY MEMBER STATES SOUGHT
                            TO AVOID CONFRONTATIONS OR TO DAMAGE UNESCO IRREPARABLY. SOME REASONS
                            FOR THIS OUTLOOK NOTED ABOVE. HOWEVER, DEPT SEES PROMINENT FACTOR

                        <p>SUBJECT: US Participation in the United Nations Educational, Scientific
                            and Cultural Organization (<gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                            >UNESCO</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>In a memorandum at Tab B, Secretary Kissinger has recommended that you
                            issue the necessary Presidential certification required by the
                            Case/Bingham Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 and make a
                            corresponding request to Congress for funds to resume US dues payments
                            to UNESCO.</p>
                        <p>Because of arbitrary anti-Israeli actions taken at the previous UNESCO
                            General Conference session in 1974, Congress enacted the Case/Bingham
                            Amendment barring further US payments to UNESCO pending a Presidential
                            certification that the Organization: "(1) has adopted policies which are
                            fully consistent with its educational, scientific and cultural
                            objectives and (2) has taken concrete steps to correct its recent
                            actions of a primarily political character."</p>
                        <p>The latest UNESCO General Conference took place in Nairobi in November
                            under the leadership of Director General <persName corresp="#p_MBAM1"
                                >M’Bow</persName> of Senegal--the first African to head a major
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> specialized agency, elected in
                            1974 with our enthusiastic support. The results of the Conference on
                            issues that concern us were mixed but basically positive. As a result of
                            active lobbying by the US:</p>
                        <p>--Israel was assigned to the European Regional Group, thus reversing a
                            1974 Conference action that had triggered the Case/Bingham
                            Amendment.</p>
                        <p>--The Conference rejected efforts to raise the Zionism/racism
                            equation.</p>
                        <p>--The Conference did reaffirm its other 1974 actions: criticizing Israel
                            for continuing archeological excavations in Jerusalem alleged to be
                            endangering Moslem monuments; withholding assistance funds from Israel.
                            The Conference, however, rejected Arab efforts to institute other
                            sanctions.</p>
                        <p>--The Conference also reaffirmed criticism of Israel for allegedly
                            denying educational and cultural rights to the populations in occupied
                            Arab territories.</p>
                        <p>On a broader issue, not directly related to the Case/Bingham Amendment
                            but of deep and abiding interest to the US, the Conference postponed
                            action on a Soviet-inspired draft declaration on mass media which would
                            have enshrined the concept of state control. The outcome was widely
                            welcomed and helps account for the generally favorable US media reaction
                            to the Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recommends your moving now to issue the certification and
                            to request the necessary funds from Congress to bring us back into full
                            and regular participation in UNESCO. Not only were the results at
                            Nairobi positive, but in the absence of movement toward a Middle East
                            settlement and a lack of gestures of Israeli flexibility on UNESCO
                            issues, the outcome on Israel-related issues was as good as could be
                            expected. There will be no real chance for further progress before the
                            next General Conference session in 1978. The results, moreover, conform
                            to the estimate Director General M'Bow gave to the Secretary last
                            October, when the Secretary said he would give full support to the
                            effort to seek resumed funding from Congress if M'Bow's predictions were
                            borne out.</p>
                        <p>The US has a treaty obligation to pay its assessed share of the UNESCO
                            budget. We are now in arrears for almost all of 1975 and 1976 and have
                            been assessed the 1977 and 1978 dues.</p>
                        <p>A decision against requesting funds of Congress would result in:</p>
                        <p>--resentment from close friends and bitterness from Third World
                            countries, particularly the Africans, who helped us to insure the
                            positive outcome at Nairobi;</p>
                        <p>--a severe weakening of our ability to assert influence and leadership on
                            important UNESCO issues, such as renewed Soviet efforts to promote
                            international action favoring government control of the media.</p>
                        <p>Were we not to be in a position to resume payment, the US would have to
                            consider withdrawing from UNESCO. Such a serious step would involve:</p>
                        <p>--cutting the innumerable ties through UNESCO between American
                            scientific/educational/intellectual circles and their foreign
                            counterparts;</p>
                        <p>--depriving the US Government of a major means to influence education,
                            science, culture and information /communications in the Third World;</p>
                        <p>--possible implications for US membership elsewhere in the UN system,
                            most immediately in the <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>, where we
                            are already in the second year of a two-year notice to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations for the necessary funds are already contained in a
                            proposed supplemental for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977 and in
                            your budget proposals for FY 1978. These amount to $69 million in the

                            the Secretary's recommendation would require no change in the

                        <p>General Draper and his colleagues presented their views that the
                            population explosion in developing countries was not only a threat to US
                            interests in the economics and in the development of those countries but
                            also, more fundamentally, presented a danger to our politico military
                            interests. They referred to the memorandum written by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> on this subject. Ambassador
                            Porter said that he had read General Taylor's memorandum and asked him
                            to comment on it further if he cared to. General Taylor said he would
                            add only that, although he was a neophyte in population matters, he felt
                            very strongly that, as stated in his memorandum, the rapid growth of
                            populations in many developing countries was a likely source of internal
                            violence and of possibilities of external aggression. He and General
                            Draper asked Ambassador Porter for his advice on how to proceed with the
                            subject. They said they had talked to General <persName corresp="#p_SB3"
                                >Scowcroft</persName> in Mr. Kissinger's office about it in terms of
                            the possibility of a <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> study. General
                            Draper said he had written the President explaining his views that rapid
                            population growth could endanger the concept of a generation of peace
                            and recommending that the President speak out on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Porter said that they were talking to someone who was already
                            converted to this whole idea. He felt that our population programs were
                            not closely enough connected to our overall aid programs but were
                            handled too separately. He believed there was no use pumping in aid
                            funds and food without closer correlation with population programs. They
                            were now much too separate. He felt the relationship needed
                            reorientation. He believed we should not put large amounts of money in
                            aid programs in developing countries without thinking over the long-term
                            consequences. He said he agreed that population growth in developing
                            countries is a definite threat to the peace, not just an economic
                            problem. Ambassador Porter recalled his experience in Korea, where he
                            had first come in contact with a national population control program. He
                            found that at the governmental level there was, at least vocally, a
                            strong program but that when he went to the village level he found that
                            the charts showing acceptors had large gaps. He found that at the
                            ministerial level it was thought that the population program was
                            necessary but at the village level it would not work for the individual
                            family until they had two male children to run the farm. In fact, the
                            government program did not really encourage women to practice birth
                            control until they had two male children.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Porter said that fundamentally this is a NSC study. An overall
                            directive for the whole program should come from the White House. He
                            said we will check on what has happened in the White House since the
                            receipt of General Draper's letter. He said we will try to get something
                            done.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Porter brought up the other subject which had been mentioned
                            by General Draper in his correspondence: the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> visit. He said he thought that the Soviet Union
                            would not be much interested in internal population programs because,
                            although they were interested in birth control for China, they wanted to
                            fill their own empty space in Siberia. He agreed, however, with General
                            Draper's argument that the Soviets should be interested, as the US is,
                            in encouraging developing countries to reduce their rates of population
                            growth. Ambassador Porter said he would make a formal proposal to
                            Kissinger to put the matter on the agenda for the President-Brezhnev
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>General Draper said that he has three important steps in mind now:</p>
                        <p>1. Talks with the Soviets concerning a positive approach to the World
                            Population Conference.</p>
                        <p>2. A statement by the President at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> this fall on the threat which population growth poses
                            for world peace.</p>
                        <p>3. The exclusion of oral contraceptives from the 40 percent limitation on
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> 's contributions to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPPF1">IPPF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He asked if Mr. Claxton and Mr. Porter would agree that this last item
                            was appropriate and, if so, if they would express their views to Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJA1">Hannah</persName> who had it under
                            consideration. Ambassador Porter and Mr. Claxton said they would.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Porter again raised the subject of the NSC and felt that the
                            object was to get it involved. Mr. Claxton suggested that it might be
                            useful sometime after the Secretary's return from Europe to convoke a
                            meeting of the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RKW1"
                                >Rush</persName>, Under Secretary Casey and Ambassador Porter with
                            Dr. Hannah and members of his staff to take a general, broad, long-range
                            policy look at US interests and programs in the population field. He
                            said he would send up suggestions on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJD1">Tydings</persName> said there were
                            several domestic problems involved which related strongly to our
                            international position. He said he believed that State and AID were far
                            ahead other departments of the Government. He said, for example, the
                            present generation of contraceptives is not adequate for the needs of
                            peoples in the diverse rural societies and that there was a great need
                            for research which, however, was not being adequately supported by the
                            US Government. He said he feels there is lacking any sense of urgency
                            anywhere else in the Government. He felt there is a lack of coordination
                            of internal sectors in relation to foreign policy interests in this
                            field. For example, although it is reported that Texas, Minnesota and
                            some other states will have exceptionally large wheat crops, he is not
                            aware of any planning to provide the necessary railroad cars to get the
                            wheat to port. Mr. Claxton added that Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> has said he is not aware
                            there is planning to provide the necessary propane or natural gas to dry
                            the large expected soybean crop in the Midwestern states this fall. He
                            also wondered whether there was planning for the necessary ships to
                            carry increased cargoes of feedgrains. Although these were generally
                            considered to be domestic matters, they strongly relate to the success
                            of basic foreign policy interests</p>
                        <p>Senator Tydings added that he believes the top command of <gloss
                                target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss> is not only unwilling to expand our
                            national family planning services but apparently is not willing to
                            support what we already have going on. Ambassador Porter and Mr. Claxton
                            both observed that it is important to be able to show abroad that we are
                            not asking peoples of other countries to do more than we are doing at
                            home.</p>
                        <p>General Taylor said he thought that any NSC study should include a sudy
                            of the domestic scene viewed from the standpoint of the effects of
                            family planning programs. Senator Tydings emphasized that logistics in
                            the US are essential to getting food abroad for family planning
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Porter asked if anyone knew what China is doing in population
                            control. General Draper said he had spent three weeks recently in China
                            and had testified before Senator <persName corresp="#p_KEM1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>'s Health Subcommittee. He would send Ambassador
                            Porter a copy of that testimony. Ambassador Porter said he would be very
                            glad to have it. General Draper outlined very briefly what he had seen
                            in China.</p>
                        <p>General Draper then brought up his concern that the amendments to the AID
                            bill proposed by 22 members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee would
                            be harmful because: 1) they authorized funds for population and broad
                            health subjects together and authorized only $150 million for both; and
                            2) as he understood it, the earmarking for population funds which had
                            been essential to the success of the program was being dropped. He asked
                            the Department's consideration of this subject and support for retaining
                            the earmarking. He said he would testify before the Foreign Affairs
                            Committee next week and would urge the Committee to leave $125 million
                            earmarked for population programs alone and to transfer the health
                            subject with $25 million to the food and nutrition section.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the President-Brezhnev meeting, Mr. Claxton said he had
                            already prepared a paper for the President's use and that he would get
                            it to Ambassador Porter to send to Mr. Kissinger. Ambassador Porter said
                            that he would also include in his memorandum to Kissinger a suggestion
                            that the population subject be taken up by the NSC in its broad aspects.

                            Population Policy</p>
                        <p>We need a more cooperative Soviet attitude on policies and programs for
                            helping the developing counties control population growth. Both the US
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably participate
                            in the World Population Conference in August 1974.</p>
                        <p>As a first step, the subject could appropriately be discussed during the
                            Brezhnev visit--with the limited objective of bi-lateral talks later in

                        <p>USSR Position</p>
                        <p>The USSR does not provide assistance to population/family planning
                            programs of developing countries and makes no contribution to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Fund for Population Activities. Soviet
                            representatives in UN bodies oppose (though less strongly than
                            previously) resolutions or actions to strengthen population growth
                            control programs. Unless there is an improvement in their present
                            attitude, they and Eastern European countries will be a negative
                            influence at the World Population Conference in August 1974.</p>
                        <p>US position</p>
                        <p>We would like to see the USSR take a positive, cooperative attitude
                            toward population growth control efforts of developing countries, toward
                            population matters in UN bodies, and toward the World Population
                            Conference, especially toward agreement by the Conference on an
                            effective World Population Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>We recommend that you:</p>
                        <p>--Tell Chairman Brezhnev we realize the Soviets and the US tend to
                            approach problems of world population growth from different points of
                            view. Nevertheless, we believe our two countries should have common
                            interests in helping the developing countries bring rapid population
                            growth under control.</p>
                        <p>-- Point out that unless present growth rates are reduced there will be
                            one billion more people in less developed countries by 1985. In less
                            than 25 years there will he one billion more people in China/India
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>--Emphasize our concern that, if such growth rates continue, in a very
                            few years a shortfall in grain production such as occurred last year
                            could find the US and other grain exporting countries unable to supply
                            all requests.</p>
                        <p>-- State our concern also that current unprecedented rapid population
                            growth will lead to violence and conflicts in or among over-populated,
                            poor countries which could involve the US and the USSR despite our
                            desire to avoid it. </p>
                        <p>-- Point out that a favorable Soviet attitude toward population growth
                            control programs in developing countries and harmonious Soviet and US
                            positions at the World Population Conference in Bucharest in August 1974
                            could help reduce these dangers and contribute to stability in both
                            developing and developed countries. </p>
                        <p>-- Propose bilateral talks on this subject later in the year.</p>
                        <p>POPULATION - WORLD POPULATION CONFERENCE</p>
                        <p>Soviet ideology and positions:</p>
                        <p>Until recently the Soviet position on world population matters followed
                            the traditional Marxist ideology that any imbalance between increase of
                            people and increase of food and goods is the result of capitalism and
                            that a change for Marxist socialism and development will rectify the
                            situation. This attitude has somewhat softened recently and some Soviet
                            experts conceed publicly that there may be situations where LDCs should
                            attempt to reduce birth rates. Soviet representatives in UN bodies
                            generally take positions ranging from opposition to abstention on issues
                            concerning assistance to population growth control programs. They do not
                            contribute to any such programs or to the UN Fund for Population
                            Activities. They appear to be motivated, at least in part, by their
                            desire to increase the low rate of population growth in the European
                            part of the USSR.</p>
                        <p>The World Population Conference</p>
                        <p>Th UN World Population Conference will be at Bucharest, August 1974. We
                            want to make it a major, effective force for more determined efforts to
                            bring world population growth under control. The principle operative
                            document to come out of the conference will be a World Population. Plan
                            of Action. The Soviet attitude toward this Plan - negative or
                            cooperative - can influence how strong it will be. Present indications
                            are that their attitude unless changed will be at best uphelpful. A
                            change is important.</p>
                        <p>Development of Soviet Cooperation</p>
                        <p>We believe Soviet leadership has not yet understood the implications of
                            rapid population growth for Soviet interests. They may be aware of the
                            population growth of China and India on their borders. They may not be
                            aware that if the present growth rates of China and India continue,
                            their combined populations will increase by one billion more people in
                            less than 25 years. Other LDCs will add about two billion people by the
                            end of the century. </p>
                        <p>They also may not fully realize that long before these vast numbers are
                            reached, the food-population balance will be so precarious that a
                            shortfall, in production even less than that which has recently been
                            occurring in the USSR, India, Southeast Asia, Central Africa and
                            elsewhere would create demands on the US and other grain exporting
                            countries beyond their ability to supply all requests.</p>
                        <p>They also may not realize that the magnitude and momentum of population
                            growth in many LDCs will almost certainly result in stagnation of their
                            development, spreading disappointment and dissatisfaction of their
                            people, internal violence, collapse of some governments, efforts by
                            other governments to direct attention from internal problems by external
                            adventures, and aggression against 'neighbors for land, water,
                            resources. These results of unrestrained population growth will
                            undermine nd threaten the prospects for a generation of peace. They will
                            create dangers of involvement by the US and the USSR against our
                            will.</p>
                        <p>A frank statement of our views of these facts to Chairman Brezhnev might
                            engage his attention and encourage a reexamination of Soviet interests
                            in world population matters based on realities rather than doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Bi-lateral discussion</p>
                        <p>We have discussed population topics with Soviet representatives in and
                            around various UN bodies. We have never had a bi-lateral discussion on
                            population policies at a senior policy level. The seriousness and
                            urgency of the problem and the fact of the World Population Conference
                            in August 1974 make it desirable to have such discussions no later than
                            the end of the year.</p>

                        <p>June 19, 1973</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>Subject: Establishment of a National Commission for the Observance of
                            World Population Year, 1974</p>
                        <p>The United Nations has designated 1974 a World Population Year and has
                            requested all Member nations to participate fully and to devote 1974 to
                            appropriate efforts and undertakings in the field of population,
                            suggesting the desirability of creating national commissions in each
                            country. (The United Nations has called a World Population Conference
                            for August 1974.)</p>
                        <p>As you have stated publicly, the continued growth of population will be
                            one of the most serious challenges to human destiny in the last third of
                            this century. The US has played a major role in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and other activities to bring world population growth
                            under control. The US also had a principal part in promoting the UN
                            resolutions designating the World Population Year and calling the World
                            Population Conference.</p>
                        <p>We believe that a small Commission, composed of distinguished private
                            citizens, broadly representative of various elements of our society,
                            would be a suitable and valuable instrument to stimulate interest in and
                            organize programs in support of the Year, to enhance public
                            understanding of world population problems, to indicateUS continued
                            support of UN activities in this field, and to serve as a helpful
                            example to other countries whose cooperation is essential if the world
                            is to respond effectively to the challenge you identified. Specialists
                            in various fields could be used by the Commission functional committees.
                            In order to assure coordination of Executive and Congressional activites
                            in support of the Year with private sector activities, we propose that
                            the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health, Education and
                            Welfare (or their designees) and two Members each of the Senate and the
                            House participate with the Commission. </p>
                        <p>It is not intended that the Commission would advise or recommend to the
                            Government policies it should adopt or positions it should take in th
                            World Population Conference. Arrangements for this purpose will be made
                            separately.</p>
                        <p>We recommend that you sign the enclosed, Executive Order establishing the
                            Commission, appoint tie members of the of Commission and invite the
                            President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House to designate
                            Members to participate with the Commission. A list of suggested names,
                            divided by categories, with suggestions for numbers to be appointed from
                            each category, is enclosed for your convenience. </p>

                            held in August of that year.</p>
                        <p>The President in his May 3 Report to the Congress on Foreign Policy said
                            of the Year and Conference:</p>
                        <p>"In order to focus international attention on the vital problem of world
                            population growth, the United Nations has designated next year as World
                            Population Year. A World Population Conference has been called for
                            August 1974. I believe information and action programs undertaken as
                            part of the observance can be a valuable means of furthering
                            appreciation of population problems and of generating more resolute
                            action by nations to solve them. The United States will cooperate fully
                            with the United Nations in observing the year and working to make the
                            World Population Conference a success.</p>
                        <p>"It is imperative that the nations of the world reach agreement on means
                            for dealing effectively with this global problem."</p>
                        <p>We regard rapid world population growth as one of the most serious
                            problems facing mankind and consider both the Year and the Conference as
                            of great importance for the attainment of US objectives: <lb/>
                            <lb/>-- to help promote a wide understanding of the problem and the need
                            for action to deal with it on the part of government leaders and the
                            public throughout the world;</p>
                        <p>-- to encourage as many countries as possible to adopt a policy of
                            reducing rapid population growth;</p>
                        <p>-- to institute effective programs to carry out this objective with both
                            bilateral and multilateral support, if needed.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this airgram is to provide additional background
                            information and material and current guidance both for discussions with
                            government officials and for stimulating appropriate media coverage.</p>
                        <p>The World Population Year </p>
                        <p>The General Assembly Resolution is enclosed.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Year is to focus world-wide attention on population
                            matters in order to accelerate, widen and deepen understanding of these
                            matters, particularly in relation to economic development and to those
                            elements of social progress which affect the quality of life of
                            individuals.</p>
                        <p>The UN has identified five major objectives for the Year:</p>
                        <p>1. Improving knowledge of the facts on population trends and
                            prospects.</p>
                        <p>2.Arousing greater awareness of the problems and implications of these
                            facts as they affect economic and social development, environment and
                            the quality of life on the planet.</p>
                        <p>3. Promoting effective education on population, family life and
                            reproductive functions, both within and without the educational
                            system.</p>
                        <p>4. Discussing plans and policies affecting population growth.</p>
                        <p>5. Expanding international cooperation and assistance in population
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>The UNGA Resolution calls on the Secretary General to prepare an
                            appropriate and detailed program of measures and activities to be
                            undertaken by the United Nations during 1972 and invites all Member
                            states to both assist in these preparations and participate fully in the
                            activities connected with the year itself.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has urged that Member governments
                            set in motion the broadest and most comprehensive possible plans both to
                            participate in the World Population Year's activities and to implement
                            and further in their respective nations the spirit behind these
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> has given the UN Fund for
                            Population Activities responsibility for promotional activities for the
                            Year. It is, of course, up to the governments themselves and to
                            concerned private organizations to decide what actions and programs
                            should be undertaken to observe the Year.</p>
                        <p>The general approach of the <gloss target="#t_UNFPA1">UNFPA</gloss> to
                            the Year goes far beyond ceremonial observance. It will promote
                            population and family planning activities including information and
                            education programs at the national and local levels with the purpose of
                            strengthening national action programs. The attention of Population
                            Officers is invited to the report of the Exec Live Director of the UNFPA
                            to the UN Population Commission on his program for this year.</p>
                        <p>These programs, which will be coordinated and to some extent funded by
                            the UNFPA, will be the primary responsibility of several different UN
                            agencies, including <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNICEF1"

                                >UNDP</gloss>. Private organizations such as International Planned
                            Parenthood Federation will also participate.</p>
                        <p>These public relations efforts will largely involve the use of existing
                            channels and techniques maintained by each of these bodies to facilitate
                            distribution and implementation to more specialized Year-related films,
                            pamphlets and activities.</p>
                        <p>Within the US a major domestic effort is being undertaken primarily by
                            private organizations to promote information and education programs in
                            support of the Year. The Department, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss> plan to encourage and supplement
                            these private efforts. A number of private organizations, such as <gloss
                                target="#t_IPPF1">IPPF</gloss>, the Population Council, the
                            Population Crisis Committee, are also working through their affiliates
                            or connections abroad to promote the Year.</p>
                        <p>Action requested: The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has actively
                            participated in the development of the WPY concept. We want the Year to
                            result in stimulating information programs and population/<gloss
                                target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> activities to a greater degree than would
                            otherwise have occurred--both for their intrinsic value and as a means
                            of creating support for a more far-reaching World Population Plan of
                            Action than might otherwise be the case. Wherever country team believes
                            conditions permit, the mission is requested to:</p>
                        <p>a. Discuss the matter with local UN officials, particularly the UNDP
                            Resident Representative, the UN Information Officer and ay UN officials
                            engaged in family planning activities, both to ascertain what steps are
                            being planned to promote observance of the Year and to suggest that UN
                            officials encourage the local government to undertake specific projects
                            in observance of the Year, including expanded public informatin and
                            education programs.</p>
                        <p>b. Discuss the matter with local officials to encourage them to consult
                            with UN officials (<gloss target="#t_Para1">para</gloss>. a.above) with
                            respect to projects and assistance that may be available in the
                            materials referred to above as may be useful.</p>
                        <p>C. The mission is also requested to use the existence of the WPY as an
                            opportunity for encouraging advances in population/FP activities where
                            that is practicable.</p>
                        <p>d. The <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> is also requested to give
                            special attention to population matters in support of the observance of
                            the WPY and to make material available to local media as
                            practicable.</p>
                        <p>e. Information regarding attitudes and activities of local governments
                            for the observance of the WPY should be reported to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The World Population Conference</p>
                        <p>The Conference is scheduled to take place in August 1974. The ECOSOC at
                            its recent session accepted the invitation of Romania to host the
                            Conference in Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>The agenda consists of the following items:</p>
                        <p>1. Recent population trends and future prospects.</p>
                        <p>2. Relations between population change and economic and social
                            development</p>
                        <p>3. Relations between population, resources and environment.</p>
                        <p>4. Population, family and human rights and well-being.</p>
                        <p>5. World Population Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the Conference, four symposia, sponsored by the UN and dealing
                            with topics on the agenda, will be held as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Population and Development, Cairo 4-14 June 1973.</p>
                        <p>2. Population, Resources and the Environment, Stockholm 24 September - 5
                            October 1973.</p>
                        <p>3. Population and the Family, Honolulu 6-15 August 11973.</p>
                        <p>4. Population and Human Rights, The Hague January 1974.</p>
                        <p>The participants at each symposium will be approximately 25 experts from
                            various countries, selected by the UN, and will attend in their
                            individual capacities. The results of the symposia will be made
                            available to the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Since the Conference is for governments, separate arrangements are being
                            made to permit parallel activities by NGOs . The Conference of
                            Non-Governmental Organizations, an unofficial organization which
                            represents over 500 NGOs accredited to ECOSOC, has been selected to
                            organize a Forum (or Tribune) to be held simultaneously with the
                            Conference to provide organizations and individuals with the opportunity
                            to gather and to express and discuss their views. This will be
                            completely separate from the Conference and separately and privately
                            financed.</p>
                        <p>By far the most important matter to be considered at the Conference from
                            the US point of view is the World Population Plan of Action (<gloss
                                target="#t_WPPA1">WPPA</gloss>). It seems likely that this WPPA will
                            be the principal product of the Conference. A draft of such a plan is to
                            be prepared by the <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> with the
                            assistance of a Panel of Experts. It will be reviewed by the UN
                            Population Commission before its transmittal to governments by May 30,
                            1974.</p>
                        <p>The US position as to the content of such a plan is being developed; our
                            preliminary thinking is that it should be placed in the broad context of
                            quality of life, human rights and economic and social development. We
                            hope it will include a brief statement of agreed principles plus sets of
                            specific recommendations for governments, UN agencies, NGOs and
                            individuals for world-wide goals (stated in general terms) in the fields
                            of demography, research, family planning services, training, education,
                            environment, migration, urbanization and other functions related to
                            population, population policy and national and international
                            organization. We do not envisage that the outcome of the Conference will
                            be in treaty form or other legally binding instrument. Given the great
                            diversity of situations, it is likely that recommendations and standards
                            will have to be couched in terms recognizing the need for flexible
                            application according to local situations.</p>
                        <p>An Interagency Committee for the World Population Conference has been
                            established to coordinate the preparation of US positions for the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Action requested: No specific action regarding the Conference is
                            requested for the present. However, the above information may be drawn
                            upon if inquiries are made by local officials. Any information regarding
                            attitudes and views of the local government towards the Conference and
                            the World Population Plan of Action should, of course, be reported to
                            the Department.</p>

                            specifically invited. Additional circulars will be sent from time to

                        <p>- three major opportunities to exploit actions we have already

                        <p>- the fundamental problem of whether population growth control is to be
                            continued as a matter of priority in the Department or treated
                            routinely,</p>
                        <p>- one new initiative.</p>
                        <p>Your views on population matters are the subject of widespread interest.
                            There is an early need for a statement of them and instructions to the
                            Department, other agencies, and the field. We have been acting under the
                            policies stated in the President's Message on Population of July 1969
                            and instructions issued jointly by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HJA1"
                                >Hannah</persName>, and Mr. Shakespeare later in 1969. (Tab A) I
                            would like to brief you on what we have been doing, are trying to do,
                            and need to do, and submit a proposal for your own instructions.</p>
                        <p>OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBLEMS </p>
                        <p>1. The World Population Year was initiated by us to make possible a
                            world-wide campaign of information and education on population matters
                            and to provide a special opportunity to persuade leaders of LDCs to
                            undertake or strengthen national population growth control programs. The
                            General Assembly and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName> have called on all
                            nations to observe theYear by appropriate information and action
                            programs. <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> assigned leadership
                            for the Year to Rafael <persName corresp="#p_SRM2">Salas</persName>, the
                            Executive Director of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Fund for
                            Population Activities. As you will recall, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in his 1973 Report to the
                            Congress on Foreign Policy declared that the US will cooperate fully in
                            observing the Year.</p>
                        <p>S/PM has responsibility within the Department for promoting and
                            coordinating US participation in Year activities. The Department and
                                <gloss target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss> are jointly responsible for
                            observance of the Year in the US.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RWD1">Rogers</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCW1">Weinberger</persName> sent the President a joint
                            memorandum on June 19, 1973, asking him to appoint a Commission for the
                            Observance of World Population Year, needed as a public body to
                            stimulate and lead activities of non-governmental organizations,
                            academic institutions, and the media in support of the Year. (Tab B) The
                            proposal has been approved by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            staff and the substantive office of <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss>.
                            It is expected to reach the President soon.</p>
                        <p>Actions Needed:</p>
                        <p>a. The Commission is already long delayed and urgently needed. A
                            supporting message from you to the President would help get it
                            established and at work. I will send you a draft memorandum when the
                            proposal reaches the White House.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> should include population
                            information among its major themes, but does not. I will try to change
                            the situation, but your support may be needed.</p>
                        <p>2. The World Population Conference, also inspired by us, scheduled for
                            Bucharest in August 1974, will be the first world conference of
                            governments on population. It will be roughly comparable in size, public
                            interest, and difficulties to the Stockholm Conference. The focus of the
                            Conference will be on the framing and adoption of a World Population
                            plan of Action to be drafted and presented by the UN SYG. Antonio
                            Carrillo Flores, former Foreign Minister of Mexico, is Secretary-General
                            of the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWD1">Rogers</persName> established an
                            Interagency Committee (with S/PM as chairman) to prepare substantive
                            positions for the Conference. We have made progress in agreeing on what
                            a Plan of Action should contain and are negotiating in the UN for the
                            adoption of positions we want. We have held informal consultations with
                            interested American non-governmental organizations and invited their
                            views and suggestions for the Conference.</p>
                        <p>The urgency of generating effective efforts by LDCs to slow population
                            growth makes the success of this Conference critical. We want it to be a
                            serious meeting of political leaders prepared to adopt targets or goals
                            for reduced birth or population growth rates. I believe this can be
                            achieved if the period before the Conference is used for planned, quiet
                            negotiations to obtain agreement from enough governments on the basic
                            elements of the Plan of Action. We are promoting such negotiations by
                            Carrillo Flores and will undertake some directly.</p>
                        <p>Actions Needed:</p>
                        <p>a. It is important to give the Conference an aura of critical
                            significance. An announcement by you that you intend to head the US
                            delegation would immediately enliven the interest of government leaders
                            around the world. I recommend that you plan to go for one or two days
                            and that you announce your intention early in 1974. I will send you a
                            detailed proposal in January.</p>
                        <p>b. The attitudes to be taken by the Soviets and Chinese at the Conference
                            are especially important. We should consult with them at a high
                            political level early next year. Your support then would be invaluable.
                            I will send you a request at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>3. Increased influence on national policy-makers and expanded program
                            action in the year ahead. US efforts to stimulate and assist national
                            population programs are now in their seventh year. Much of the initial
                            tedious, frustrating task of building institutions and persuading
                            governments to take action has been accomplished. Following a strategy
                            adopted in 1966 and reviewed and approved by President Nixon in 1969, we
                            have</p>
                        <p>- institutionalized population policy and action in State and <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>- seen Congressional funding raised to $125,000,000 a year;</p>
                        <p>- stimulated agreements for bilateral aid on population matters with 36
                            developing countries; </p>
                        <p>- pressed for and achieved the necessary resolutions for population
                            action by all relevant UN agencies; </p>
                        <p>- obtained functioning, if still far from perfect, organizational
                            arrangements and programs for population action programs in most UN
                            agencies; </p>
                        <p>- helped create and enlarge the UN Fund for Population Activities to a
                            program level of about $40,000,000 this year, providing assistance to
                            over 60 countries an many multinational programs.</p>
                        <p>Some 29 countries with 75% of the world's population now have at least
                            limited population growth control programs, and 16 others have some sort
                            of government family planning service programs. Three-fourths of these
                            were started after US aid became available.</p>
                        <p>The work of the past seven years plus the steadily mounting pressures of
                            population growth and the current world food situation have generated a
                            receptivity and potential in many countries for substantial expansion of
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>In order to exploit these opportunities for program expansion, we have
                            two needs.</p>
                        <p>Actions Needed:</p>
                        <p>a. Advocacy of constructive population policies and programs by the
                            President and you in appropriate meetings with national leaders. I will
                            recommend specifics for each meeting.</p>
                        <p>b. The expansion of population programs in many countries which we can
                            reasonably hope to achieve in 1974-75 will require an increase in the
                            Congressional earmarking of population funds from the $125,000,000 for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 to $150,000,000 for FY 1975.
                            This problem may reach you in the FY 1975 AID budget.</p>
                        <p>PROBLEM. OF PRIORITY FOR POPULATION MATTERS </p>
                        <p>The current proposal to merge S/PM into the potential new bureau of
                            Oceans, Environment and Science raises the issue of whether population
                            activities are to be pursued as a matter of major importance to the
                            United States or treated as a routine matter. If the former, I recommend
                            against the change for three reasons.</p>
                        <p>1. The subject matter of S/PM is different from the activities proposed
                            for the new bureau. This was recognized in the legislation (and
                            Conference Committee report) establishing the new bureau, which
                            specified the activities to be included and did not include population
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>2. It would be impossible to carry out S/PM's assigned responsibility as
                            the focal point for coordination and policy on population matters.</p>
                        <p>3. It would be much more difficult to carry out S/PM's responsibilities
                            for the World Population Year and Conference.</p>
                        <p>Action Needed:</p>
                        <p>This is a relatively urgent matter. I will send you a separate memorandum
                            on it.</p>
                        <p>ONE NEW INITIATIVE</p>
                        <p>As a practical matter, there is no likelihood of substantial birth
                            control programs in most African and some Latin American countries,
                            except as part of a national health service reaching the rural areas.
                            These do not exist. In order to have a vehicle for family planning
                            services-- and as a matter of simple humanity--I believe a new
                            initiative should be undertaken in collaboration with the World Bank, UN
                            agencies, and other donors to help developing countries establish basic,
                            para-medical health services, including family planning, to reach their
                            rural peoples. I am testing this idea with the World Bank, UN agencies,
                            and some donors and may have a recommendation for you in several weeks.
                            If such a proposal could be offered for inclusion in the World
                            Population Plan of Action, it would help to carry a much stronger Plan
                            than would otherwise be obtainable.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: POPULATION AND DETENTE</p>
                        <p>1. I MET MONDAY WITH GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_DWH1">WILLIAM
                                DRAPER</persName> AND FORMER SENATOR JOSEPH TYDINGS, BOTH OF WHOM
                            ARE WELL KNOWN TO YOU. FOR REASONS I CANNOT COMPLETELY FATHOM, THEY ARE
                            ESCORTING A GROUP OF JAPANESE FAMILY PLANNERS AROUND THE WORLD.
                            NOTWITHSTANDING THAT, WE HAD AN EXCELLENT IF CHEERLESS TALK ABOUT THE
                            CONTINUING GRIM PROSPECTS FOR SOUTH ASIA.</p>
                        <p>2. THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT HAS LONG INTERESTED ME. WHILE IN THE WHITE
                            HOUSE IN 1969, I WROTE THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS ON
                            POPULATION, THE FIRST SUCH DECLARATION OF NATIONAL POLICY EVER. IT MET
                            GREAT ENTHUSIASM IN THE CONGRESS-- SENATOR TYDINGS AND SPEAKER <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCJW1">MCCORMACK</persName> INSTANTLY SAW ITS
                            IMPORTANCE-- AND THE UPSHOT WAS THAT THE DOMESTIC SIDE OF POPULATION
                            POLICY WAS PRETTY WELL SETTLED FOR DECADES TO COME.</p>
                        <p>3. ONE REASON THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ADDRESS HIMSELF SO EXPLICITLY TO
                            U.S. DOMESTIC POLICY WAS THAT IN HIS JUDGMENT OUR PRONOUNCEMENTS AND
                            ACTIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING FIELD WOULD BE UNWELCOME
                            AND MIGHT APPEAR HYPOCRITICAL UNLESS WE WERE SEEN CLEARLY TO BE PUTTING
                            OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. THE MESSAGE ALSO SPOKE TO THE INTERNATIONAL
                            ISSUES, BUT LESS FIRMLY AND DECISIVELY, IN PART BECAUSE THERE SEEMED
                            LITTLE WE COULD DO, BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE ALL SENSED THE IMPORTANCE OF
                            FIRST SETTLING OUR OWN AFFAIRS ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE AND CHARTING OUR OWN
                            COURSE FOR THE FUTURE, A PROCESS INITIATED BY THE PRESIDENT AND
                            CONTINUED BY THE COMMISSION ON POPULATION GROWTH AND THE AMERICAN FUTURE
                            WHICH HE APPOINTED.</p>
                        <p>4. FOUR YEARS LATER, SO FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE UNITED STATES STILL LACKS
                            ANY COHERENT POLICY WITH RESPECT TO WORLD POPULATION GROWTH, THOUGH IT
                            HAS BEEN CONSCIENTIOUS AND GENEROUS IN ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO
                            MULTI-LATERUL AGENCIES. THE TIME MAY BE UPON US FOR SOME FURTHER
                            ATTENTION TO THESE MATTERS; AS THE PRESIDENT INDICATED IN HIS 1973
                            FOREIGN POLICY REPORT, 1974 WILL BE WORLD POPULATION YEAR, A CONFERENCE
                            HAS BEEN CALLED FOR AUGUST, AND THE UNITED STATES HAS PLEDGED FULL
                            COOPERATION.</p>
                        <p>5. I NEED NOT LIMN FOR YOU THE POPULATION PROBLEM IN INDIA, EXCEPT TO
                            OFFER TWO VIGNETTES. WHEN I RETURNED TO NEW DELHI PAST WEEK, THE FIRST
                            PARAGRAPH OF THE EXCELLENT "WHILE YOU WERE AWAY" SUMMARY PREPARED BY THE
                            EMBASSY STAFF ASSERTED "WHILE YOU WERE AWAY, THE POPULATION OF INDIA
                            GREW BY 1.1 MILLION PERSONS" SECOND VIGNETTE: THE POPULATION EXPERT AT
                            THE FORD FOUNDATION OFFICE HERE ROUTINELY REFERS TO THE ADVENT OF "THE
                            SECOND INDIA," SINCE REPUTABLE DEMOGRAPHERS ARE AGREED THAT IF IT
                            CONTINUES ON ITS PRESENT COURES INDIA'S POPULATION WILL DOUBLE BY THE
                            END OF THIS CENTURY.</p>
                        <p>6. NO ONE CAN KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS SOCIETY OF THE STRAINS
                            INHERENT IN A BILLION PEOPLE LIVING ON ITS LAND AREA, BUT THE SOCIAL,
                            ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TENSIONS WILL BE VERY GREAT INDEED. I EXPECT THEY
                            WILL POSE A GRAVE THREAT TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN SOUTH ASIA AS A
                            WHOLE, FOR THE PROBLEM IS NOT CONFINED TO INDIA. BANGLADESH IS DOUBTLESS
                            THE MORE TRAGIC CASE. AND SRI LANKA IS ALREADY PAYING A PRICE IN HUNGER,
                            POVERTY AND INSTABILITY FOR ITS ENORMOUS POPULATION GROWTH ON A FIXED OR
                            DECLINING RESOURCE BASE OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY.</p>
                        <p>7. FOR REASONS I CANNOT FULLY FATHOM, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IS TURNING
                            AGAINST ITS OWN FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS. DRAPER AND TYDINGS SIMPLY
                            SUGGEST THAT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAS A DEEPLY INGRAINED PRO-NATAWRST
                            OUTLOOK AND IS INCAPABLE OF MOTIVATING ITSELF TO BUDGET LARGE SUMS FOR
                            FAMILY PLANNING OR TO RUN EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS WITH THE MONEY THEY DO
                            BUDGET. </p>
                        <p>AS I COME TO UNDERSTAND THE HINDU FAMILY STRUCTURE SOMEWHAT BETTER, ITS
                            CLEAR THAT CHILDREN ARE PERHAPS THE MOST PRIZED POSSESSION, AND THE MORE
                            OF THEM THE BETTER. LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND, AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL,
                            MAY ALSO BE A CONTINUING AWARENESS THAT, AS MANY MILLIONS AS INDIA HAS,
                            CHINA HAS MORE.</p>
                        <p>8. THE UNITED STATES HAS GOT BURNED IN FAMILY PLANNING IN INDIA, AND THE
                            GOI HAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR BOTH TO <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> AND TO THE PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS THAT IT IS AN AREA WHERE
                            THEIR FUNDS MAY BE ACCEPTED BUT THEIR ADVICE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTENCE
                            ARE NOT WANTED. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE ONLY SORT OF HELP INDIA WILL ACCEPT
                            IN FAMILY PLANNING WILL BE MULTI-LATERAL ASSISTANCE, AND EVEN THERE SHE
                            IS NOT LIKELY TO ASK FOR IT. DRAPER REPORTS ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY EVEN IN
                            GETTING THE GOI TO SEEK MODEST FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE U.N. FAMILY
                            PLANNING AGENCY.</p>
                        <p>9. WE WILL, OF COURSE, RESPECT THEIR WISHES. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH
                            SECRETARY SHULTZ' STATEMENT IN NAIROBI THAT "AID STIMULATES DEVELOPMENT
                            ONLY WHERE THERE EXISTS THE WILL AND COMPETENCE TO UTILIZE IT
                            EFFECTIVELY." WHETHER THE COMPETENCE IN POPULATION PLANNING EXISTS
                            HERE-- OR ANYWHERE-- I LEAVE TO THE EXPERTS. AS FOR THE WILL, I CALL
                            YOUR ATTENTION TO NEW DELHI 12011 AND REST OF THE MESSAGES IN THE SORRY
                            SAGA OF THE INDIAN FAMILY PLANNING BUDGET.</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: POPULATION AND DETENTE</p>
                        <p>10. WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO DO FOR THE INDIANS WHAT THEY REFUSE TO DO FOR
                            THEMSELVES, NOR DO I EXPECT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO RETAIN MUCH
                            ENTHUSIASM IN THE FACE OF THIS EVIDENCE. IN WASHINGTON AND SINCE
                            RETURNING TO DELHI I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED -- NAY AWED -- BY THE STRENGTH
                            AND DEPTH OF FEELING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING AND THE
                            DISMAY WITH WHICH THE BUDGET CUTS HAVE BEEN GREETED.</p>
                        <p>11 NONETHELESS, THE PROBLEM WORSENS IN SOUTH ASIA, AND THE UNITED STATES
                            WILL NOT BE BLIND TO IT, NOR, I TRUST, WILL THE OTHER GREAT POWERS.
                            THOUGH THIS WILL SEEM A BAD WEEK TO MAKE THE POINT, I THINK A PARTIAL
                            SOLUTION OVER THE LONG RUN MAY LIE IN US-SOVIET COOPERATION, AND IN
                            WHATEVER ABILITY WE AND THE SOVIETS MIGHT JOINTLY MUSTER TO PERSUADE THE
                            NATIONS OF SOUTH ASIA THAT A REDUCTION IN POPULATION GROWTH IS NECESSARY
                            TO THE PEACEFUL, STABLE WORLD WE SEEK. IN ADDITION, WITH SOVIET-AMERICAN
                            LEADERSHIP, AND WITH CONTRIBUTIONS TO MATCH, THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE
                            WORLD AND THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS MIGHT BE INDUCED TO
                            CONCENTRATE MORE RESOURCES ON THIS AREA.</p>
                        <p>12. I DO NOT PROPOSE THAT WE START WITH INDIA. THE POLITICAL DIMENSIONS
                            OF SOVIET AND AMERICAN ACTIVITY HERE ARE TOO GREAT, AND INDIA'S MISTRUST
                            OF OUTSIDERS MEDDLING IS TOO DEEP. BUT WHAT ABOUT BANGLADESH, A
                            POTENTIAL BASKET CASE OF A NATION IN WHICH WE, THE SOVIETS AND -- NOT SO
                            INCIDENTALLY -- INDIA ALREADY HAVE HEAVY INVESTMENTS AND LASTING
                            COMMITMENTS? MIGHT THAT NOT BE THE PLACE TO COMMENCE A DEMONSTRATION OF
                            THE WAYS IN WHICH DETENTE CAN LEAD TO PARTIAL SOLUTIONS TO OTHER
                            PROBLEMS MENACING WORLD STABILITY? I DO NOT, OF COURSE, MEAN TO
                            PRESCRIBE FOR A COUNTRY I HAVE NEVER SEEN, NOR TO INTRUDE ON DACCA'S OWN
                            VIEW OF THE MATTER. PERHAPS MUCH IS QUIETLY GOING FORWARD THAT I DO NOT
                            KNOW, AND IN ANY CASE I PRESUME LARGE INITIATIVES THERE WILL AWAIT THE
                            ARRIVAL OF A NEW AMBASSADOR.</p>
                        <p>13. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL IS BEGINNING A STUDY
                            OF THE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION GROWTH, AND OF ITS
                            CONSEQUENCES FOR WORLD PEACE. </p>
                        <p>I WOULD HEARTILY ENDORSE SUCH A STUDY, AND URGE THAT IT MAKE USE OF THE
                            MOST DISTINGUISHED DEMOGRAPHERS AND ADVANCED SOCIAL SCIENCE TECHNIQUES,
                            MUCH AS THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION DID WITH AMERICAN DOMESTIC POPULATION
                            GROWTH. IT MAY WANT TO TAKE SOUTH ASIA AS ITS FIRST AREA OF CONCERN.</p>
                        <p>14. FINALLY, MAY I SAY THAT THE LIKES OF DRAPER, WITH THEIR DOGGEDNESS,
                            THEIR APOLITICAL SELFLESSNESS AND THEIR REMARKABLE SET OF CONTACTS
                            AROUND THE WORLD SHOULD BE ASKED TO HELP AS IT SUITS OUR PURPOSES. THEY
                            CAN SAY THINGS WE CAN'T, AND PEOPLE -- EVEN IN INDIA -- SEEM TO LISTEN.
                            SOMETIMES.</p>

                            <lb/>FROM: <persName corresp="#p_CCA2">CHARLES A. COOPER</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Population <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am the culprit who has delayed this NSSM. I have many problems with it,
                            but won't hold it up if you think it should go forward at this time.
                            However, I discussed this with <persName corresp="#p_HHE1">Hal
                                Horan</persName> last week and we agreed we would talk to Win
                                <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName> about it on his return.
                            (I gave Win this week to get settled. ) Apart from tightening up on the
                            content of the study, I think it is absolutely essential that we know in
                            advance who is going to do the study and how. This is an area where such
                            a high-level study can be a real mess.</p>
                        <p>You should know, if you don't already, that <persName corresp="#p_DWH1"
                                >Draper</persName> (along with <persName corresp="#p_CPP1">Phil
                                Claxton</persName>) belongs to a school of thought about population
                            which has few respectable adherents left. In addition to taking a rather
                            over dramatic view of the problem, Draper, Claxton, et al continue to
                            ride a particular hobbyhorse of a solution, namely that better
                            contraceptives and family planning programs are the answer. Almost
                            nobody agrees with this anymore, since there is abundant evidence that
                            changing the number of children people want is much more important than
                            reducing the number of unwanted children.</p>
                        <p>We have been plagued, in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and
                            elsewhere, with simplistic views of the population problem and
                            simplistic approaches to its solution. A NSSM that reinforced the wrong
                            sets of entrenched attitudes could do much more harm than good.
                            Nevertheless, the choice is yours.</p>

                        <p>OBJECTIVES OF THE WORLD POPULATION YEAR, 1974</p>
                        <p>In December 1970 the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly
                            designated 1974 as World Population Year (<gloss target="#t_WPY1"
                                >WPY</gloss>). The purpose of the WPY is to focus international
                            attention on the need to achieve a balance between people and resources
                            through rational policy and vigorous action. The WPY is also to be the
                            occasion for increasing substantially the financial resources available
                            for population activities by UN agencies, national governments, and
                            nongovernmental organizations.</p>
                        <p>WPY Activities. Governments have been called upon to establish
                            populations commissions to initiate and coordinate national WPY
                            activities. Many of the commissions may continue to function after 1974,
                            thus permanently strengthening national population/family planning
                            programs. To date, more than 50 nations, including the United States,
                            have established WPY Commissions.</p>
                        <p>The highlight of the Year will be the first intergovernmental World
                            Population Conference, to be held in Bucharest, August 19-30.* A
                            Population Tribune, held simultaneously in Bucharest, will provide a
                            forum for the discussion of population issues by private organizations
                            which have consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council
                                (<gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>[footnote in original]* There have been two UN world conferences of
                            demographers, in 1954 and 1965.</p>
                        <p>Major Objective: Convergence of Ideas. The Conference is expected to
                            adopt common positions and action proposals in the "world Population
                            Plan of Action" (<gloss target="#t_WPPA1">WPPA</gloss>). The Plan is
                            intended to complement existing international strategies which seek to
                            attain higher levels of economic and social development among all
                            countries. In particular, the US Government supports international
                            efforts to:</p>
                        <p>--Strengthen governments' resolve to ensure that information and
                            education about family planning, as well as the means to practice it
                            effectively, are made available to all prospective parents by the end of
                            the UN's Second Development Decade (1971-80).</p>
                        <p>--Prevail upon countries with rapid population growth to establish
                            national policies of low death and birth rates, to he achieved through
                            measures to improve health and reduce fertility.</p>
                        <p>--Encourage governments to set specific targets for the attainment of
                            these objectives and, in addition to the provision of birth control
                            services, to employ social and economic measures to limit births.</p>
                        <p>The US also supports acceptance of a goal in the WPPA of accelerated
                            reduction in fertility so that by the year 2000 world fertility will
                            have reached replacement; that is, a level which, if continued, would
                            lead to stabilization of world population at 8.5 to 9 billion (in
                            comparison with 3.9 billion in 1974). The advantage of vigorous birth
                            control action in LDCs becomes fully apparent in the 21st century:
                            Procrastination in reducing average family size can lead to an
                            additional doubling of <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> population
                            prior to stabilization. Today's LDC population of 2.8 billion can not be
                            expected to stop growing until it reaches at least close to 7 billion,
                            even assuming that fertility drops to replacement levels by 2000.
                            However, in the absence of any determined action by national
                            governments, LDCs may have to provide for from 10 to 14 billion before
                            their populations stabilize (see chart). </p>
                        <p>[Graph:] <lb/>PROJECTIONS OF TOTAL POPULATION</p>
                        <p>[image of graph]</p>
                        <p>Some participants at the Bucharest conference will oppose global
                            demographic targets on grounds of national sovereignty in population
                            matters and on the premise that no single global target can take into
                            account either the diversity of population problems or of national
                            abilities to deal with them. Proponents of global goals will point out
                            that because population growth creates global problems, it has become a
                            global issue, requiring global solutions; and that being world averages,
                            global goals permit a range of national targets.</p>
                        <p>Funding of Programs. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has
                            recently completed the first worldwide survey of expenditures for birth
                            control (see table). Its findings can be treated only as orders of
                            magnitude, but they are, nevertheless, useful working figures. The
                            surprisingly modest sums expended by all sources in 1971 give fresh
                            urgency to the entire issue of funding birth control programs in LDCs.
                            Moreover, it appears from the survey that individuals in LDCs spent more
                            on contraception than did governments. It is also noteworthy that in
                            LDCs at least two and a half times an much money was spent on (largely
                            illegal) abortions than on contraception.</p>
                        <p>High Priority for Family Plannin Projects. Recent worldwide economic
                            developments are making population problems in energy-poor LDCs more
                            urgent but solutions more difficult. A combination of insufficient
                            foreign exchange earnings, inadequate levels of foreign aid, and an
                            increasingly severe burden of external debt presents a serious threat to
                            the entire development effort of many LDCs. While population growth
                            control is not a substitute for economic development, slowing the rate
                            of population expansion takes on an added importance during a period of
                            prospectively slower economic growth.</p>
                        <p>The prospects for adequate funding of population programs are imperiled,
                            however, by other priority needs. Economic difficulties may limit
                            expenditures for all social services, including family planning, as has
                            apparently occurred in India. Moreover, in addition to its more widely
                            noted ramifications, the inflationary impact of higher oil prices will
                            be manifest in increasing medical and allied professional costs: thus
                            affecting population programs. Care must be taken in reordering national
                            spending priorities in the face of economic stringency to give birth
                            control proper emphasis in the context of an overall--and more
                            difficult--growth strategy.</p>

                        <p>Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and
                            Overseas Interests</p>
                        <p>Attached at Tab I are a proposed memorandum to the President and a draft
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> recommending a study by the
                            Under Secretaries Committee of the national security implications of
                            worldwide population growth.</p>
                        <p>A NSSM at tis time on population growth is useful for two reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. It will be helpful in designing the U.S. position for the wold
                            population conference this August in Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>2. It will respond to frequent letters which the President and you have
                            received, principally from <persName corresp="#p_DWH1">Bill
                                Draper</persName>, urging <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> focus
                            on this problem. The proposed study focusses on the implications of
                            population growth for our security and other overseas interests (e.g.,
                            trade and development); it does not contemplate review of ecological and
                            sociological aspects. The study is proposed for accomplishment by the
                            Under Secretaries Committee in order to keep it a low-key and hopefully
                            manageable project. There may be pressure to include agencies like
                                <gloss target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CEA2"
                                >CEA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> in the study
                            group, but we can hope to avoid that by billing this as a preliminary
                            effort on which we would seek their views for further ork. We may have
                            to concede CIEP participation at the outset, but I propose that we wait
                            to see if pressure to do so actually develops.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you forward the memorandum at Tab I to the President requesting
                            approval to issue the NSSM at Tab A, or, alternatively that you sign the

                        <p>TO: The Secretary of Defense <lb/>The Secretary of Agriculture <lb/>The
                            Director of Central Intelligence <lb/>The Deputy Secretary of State
                            Administrator, Agency for International Development</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security
                            and Overseas Interests</p>
                        <p>The President has directed a study of the impact of world population
                            growth on U.S. security and overseas interests. The study should look
                            forward at least until the year 2000, and use several alternative
                            reasonable projections of population growth.</p>
                        <p>In terms of each projection, the study should assess:</p>
                        <p>-- the corresponding pace of development, especially in poorer
                            countries;</p>
                        <p>-- the demand for US exports, especially of food, and the trade problems
                            the US may face arising from competition for resources; and</p>
                        <p>-- the likelihood that population growth or imbalances will produce
                            disruptive foreign policies and international instability.</p>
                        <p>The study should focus on the international political and economic
                            implications of population growth rather than its ecological,
                            sociological or other aspects.</p>
                        <p>The study should then offer possible courses of action for the United
                            States in dealing with population matters abroad, particularly in
                            developing countries, with special attention to these questions:</p>
                        <p>-- What, if any, new initiatives by the United States are needed to focus
                            international attention on the population problem?</p>
                        <p>-- Can technological innovations or development reduce growth or
                            ameliorate its effects?</p>
                        <p>-- Could the United States improve its assistance in the population field
                            and if so, in what form and through which agencies -- bilateral,
                            multilateral, private?</p>
                        <p>The study shuld take into account the President's concern that population
                            policy is a human concern intimately related to the dignity of the
                            individual and the objective of the United States is to work closely
                            with others, rather than seek to impose our views on others.</p>
                        <p>The President has directed that the study be accomplished by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries Committee. The
                            Chairman, Under Secretaries Committee, is requested to forward the study
                            together with the Committee's action recommendations no later than May
                            29, 1974, for consideration by the President.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. GARDNER: It is very good of you to keep the luncheon appointment with
                            us; we are suprised and delighted.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: There was just not another good day for some time, and I
                            wanted to have this discussion. I have made this <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Speech. It reflects that sometimes the best way to make
                            policy is to announce it and then see what needs to be done to implement
                            it. I have announced that we are willing to do something and I am
                            willing to ram it through the government if we have a good program.
                            Winston, how would you like to proceed?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_LW2">LORD</persName>: I asked each of our
                            guests to look at your UN Speech and to consider what are the
                            implications of some recent events. The question is how we should now
                            move out, with the UN Speech as a starting point but not confining our
                            discussion to that framework.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to food policy.]</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: Quite simply, we have a trend of rising food prices and this
                            has led to a reversal, for the first time, of the trends of declining
                            death rates and improving nutrition. I feel that a global strategy must
                            be based on a shift in emphasis from increasing supply to reducing
                            demand -- most centrally population growth. Our standing predictions on
                            population growth are no longer possible. Something has to give, the
                            birth rate or the death rate.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: I wanted to use this meeting to see how you see these new
                            issues. Watergate or not this Administration has to turn to the task of
                            handing over the job to others. By that time we can at least define the
                            issues. We can get going by defining what the problems are and what are
                            the directions in which we should be moving. I would like to get
                            together on this, during the week of June 19-25. Can you (Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>) set this up? Will two hours do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: Yes. We (Handler and Brown) have a group that will be ready
                            with something by then.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: You (Mr. Handler) can get a group set up on science and
                            technology questions for a session around the end of July.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: One other thing I would like to mention is the UN Population
                            Conference in August.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Frankly I'm not sure I knew there was one.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: If you indicate a desire to go, it will change the whole
                            thing. For example, the Soviets will have to recognize this problem.</p>
                        <p>TRE SECRETARY: Who is coming to the Conference?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: That's still unclear.</p>
                        <p>TRE SECRETARY : Who are we planning to send? (Turning to mr. Enders) Are
                            you confirmed Yet?</p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: No, so I can't go.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GARDNER: The point is population is important and we have to do what
                            we do on this question in a multilateral framework.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: What do we want to do?</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: I have brought along a written proposal which I will leave.
                            First we want each country to set a population target; only a handful
                            have done so. The urgency is not recognized. For examnle, when I talked
                            to the Algerians, they shrugged off the by asserting that Algeria could
                            support double its present population. They seemed shocked when I told
                            them the demographic mathematics were such that they needed to start new
                            programs yesterday if their objective was to keep their population from
                            going much beyond double the present level. Second, we want an
                            obilgation on each country to report to the UN what it is done.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: Who is handling this in the Department? </p>
                        <p>MR. ENDERS: <persName corresp="#p_CPP1">Phil Claxton</persName>.</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETNRY: Someone said there is a <gloss target="#t_NSSM1"
                                >NSSM</gloss> on Population.</p>
                        <p>MR. LORD: We are doing this and it should be completed shortly.</p>
                        <p>MR. GARDNER: The third thing we need is a stratetgy for reducing
                            fertility -- to include action on wome's riqhts, jobs, education and
                            econbmic development.</p>
                        <p>MR. SKOLNIKOFP: The last point is the important one.</p>
                        <p>MR.BROWN: That's right. Historically birth rates have declined only where
                            standards of living are rising so that personal security is established
                            apart from having children. The problem is reproducing out of
                            desperation. "</p>
                        <p>THE SECRETARY: How do you reproduce out of desperation?</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: With high infant Mortality you have many children to assure
                            that some are around later to do the work and take care of you. But
                            returning to the broader issue, the specter that bothers me is that we
                            night provide just enough food aid to keep people alive but not to raise
                            their level of nutrition and standard of Ilviag.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PARKER: We are Proposing that food aid be accompanied by conditions
                            in the population field.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: How do you do that internationally without appearing racist?
                            You have to convince the LDCs that population control is in their
                            interest not ours.</p>
                        <p>MR. BROWN: One problem is that the United States is among those many
                            countries that does not have a population target.</p>
                        <p>MR. HANDLER: We could get one merely by making explicit what we know is
                            going to happen anyway.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to food policy.] </p>

                        <p>THE CONFERENCE </p>
                        <p>This <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-convened World Population
                            Conference, with 130 governments expected to attend, is the highlight of
                            World Population Year. Both events are U.S. initiatives. Our major
                            purpose is to obtain agreement to take more urgent, determined, local
                            and international action to slow rapid population growth -- because of
                            its burden on social and economic development and its contribution to
                            interdependent, global problems of scarcities of food and resources and
                            of damage to the environment.</p>
                        <p>The substantive agenda includes population trends and prospects, and the
                            relationship of population to development, resources and environment,
                            the family and, as the major topic, a World Population Plan of Action. A
                            UN draft of this Plan has been reviewed at five regional preparatory
                            meetings and is under study by governments prior to the Conference.
                            Rightly treating population as an integral part of economic and social
                            development, the draft contains inter alia, thirteen pages of
                            comprehensive "Recommendations." Drafted to offend no one and achieve
                            maximum consensus, the UN draft, though substantively unobjectionable,
                            is too lengthy, technically demographic in language and its
                            recommendations too watered down and permissive. At the conference we
                            will seek, through formal and informal negotiations, subtly rather than
                            blatantly three specific improvements:</p>
                        <p>1. The inclusion of certain additional principles, including the human
                            right to have the information and means to determine family size and the
                            obligation to do so responsibly, improvement in the status of women, the
                            importance of taking account of the interests of other nations in
                            deciding national policy and the necessity of international cooperation
                            in this field.</p>
                        <p>2. The specification of goals for reducing rates of population growth for
                            both developing and developed countries, and for the world, and</p>
                        <p>3. A condensed, focused, simply worded, summary version of the basic
                            recommendations extracted from the UN draft.</p>
                        <p>These ideas, put forward in the UN Population Commission and regional
                            consultative meetings, have been favorably received by a substantial
                            number of other countries, although they are hesitant to provide open
                            support. Any decision on whether to press for a "top-of-the-Plan"
                            summary formulation must await consultation with other delegations in
                            Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>ATTITUDES OF OTHERS </p>
                        <p>The Asian countries, where population problems are most acute, are aware
                            of them; have policies for controlling population growth and will agree
                            to strong action at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>The African countries (with some exceptions) are only slowly becoming
                            aware of the problem, lack basic data and motivation and many tend to
                            view U.S. promotion of population programs with suspicion.</p>
                        <p>Latin America is finally making considerable progress in instituting
                            family planning programs, with the Caribbean in the lead and with
                            Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela prominent. Brazil, formerly pro-natalist,
                            is showing signs of a shift. Argentina is almost alone in its strongly
                            pronatalist stance.</p>
                        <p>Europe is reaching replacement level fertility, heading toward eventual
                            zero population growth, so its problems are of a different order. In UN
                            fora, France still maintains a pro-natalist stance, but in a recent
                            dramatic change legalized the sale of contraceptives. The Scandinavians
                            are the leaders in pushing global action to control population
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>China, which some observers describe as a complete and effective family
                            planning program takes an equivocal, but doctrinaire, position in
                            international fora, blaming the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>
                            population problem on "colonialist exploitation" and insisting that
                            economic and social revolution is the answer.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> tends to take a similar, but
                            less strident line in the UN. Soviet internal policy seems to seek to
                            accelerate the Slavic and Baltic population growth rates. Eastern
                            European countries have very low birth rates and Romania and Bulgaria
                            are seeking to raise them.</p>
                        <p>MAJOR CONFERENCE ISSUES</p>
                        <p>A number of contentious issues are apt to arise at the Conference:</p>
                        <p>1) In some third world countries, U.S. and other DC motives in promoting
                            population policies and family planning and in providing assistance in
                            these fields are suspect as motivated by racism, economic imperialism
                            and desire to maintain dominance.</p>
                        <p>2) Moreover some LDC's complain generally at the alleged profligate use
                            of the world's resources by the U.S. and other developed countries and
                            we may be faced with demands for a reduction in their use and a more
                            equitable distribution.</p>
                        <p>3) A few LDC's argue that rapid population growth stimulates development,
                            contrary to the U.S. view, and will therefore resist proposals to limit
                            population growth.</p>
                        <p>4) The argument is also made that family planning programs cannot be
                            effective without prior, major economic and social as well as structural
                            changes in society. While the foregoing and other issues may be
                            troublesome, we are well accustomed to dealing with them in UN
                            bodies.</p>
                        <p>The World Population Plan of Action (not a binding agreement but a series
                            of recommendations to governments) is consistent with U.S. programs and
                            advances our foreign policy objectives. Targets to limit population
                            growth are consistent with U.S. population trends. Recommendations for
                            family planning policies and programs are consistent with U.S.
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Some difficulties are anticipated in having the Plan contain recommended
                            goals and targets for both LDCs and <gloss target="#t_DCs1">DCs</gloss>.
                            For LDC goals we favor a reduction of the birth rate by 10 points per
                            1,000 by 1985 and replacement level of fertility in 2 or 3 decades. For
                            DC5 (which also have population problems and an equal or greater
                            responsibility) we propose replacement levels by 1985 and stationary
                            population as soon as practicable thereafter. The UN draft Plan calls
                            for national population policies. The U.S. lacks one, although <gloss
                                target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss> does have a family planning program and
                            in fact the U.S. has attained replacement level with eventual
                            stabilization likely.</p>
                        <p>If the question of abortion should arise, we should point out that, with
                            widely differing views, it is unwise and impractical for the Conference
                            to seek an agreed position.</p>
                        <p>The Third World Population Conference is the first to be held at the
                            government level. Only six countries (Laos, Malta, Niger, Saudi Arabia,
                            South Africa and Tonga) have indicated they will not attend, and all
                            countries with large populations are expected to be present. It is clear
                            that the meeting will be political, in the broad sense rather than
                            ideological. It is also clear that the meeting will be a test for many
                            nations of their ability to come together on a sensitive subject. The
                            U.S. in recent years has been prominent in the population field, and the
                            behavior of its delegation from the committees to the corridors requires
                            walking prudently forward. </p>
                        <p>THREE INJUNCTIONS </p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. will not propose any specific new UN organizations or
                            programs. We should seek to extend and enhance those which are already
                            established in population and related fields.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. Delegation opposes any new institutional changes by the
                            Conference in regard to UN population policy-making or action bodies
                            (i.e., <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, Population Commission,
                            United Nations Fund for Population Activities, <gloss target="#t_UNDP1"
                                >UNDP</gloss> Governing Council, the Specialized Agencies of the
                            United Nations, or the World Bank). If any discussion in this regard
                            arises in the Conference meetings, the U.S. should argue that (a)
                            present institutions are working effectively, (b) it is not on the
                            agenda, and (c) ECOSOC and the UN General Assembly are the proper place
                            to discuss and decide on UN institutional arrangements. Any discussion,
                            even corridor, by or with other delegations should be brought to the
                            attention of the Head of Delegation.</p>
                        <p>3. The U.S. Delegation shall not introduce or instigate discussion of
                            financial implications or any financial proposals or schemes in regard
                            to population, family planning, or development assistance for
                            recommendation by the Conference. The U.S. is unable to make any
                            longterm commitments in the financial area, and its short-term pledges
                            and contributions are handled after approval by the U.S. Congress in the
                            appropriate UN bodies. Financing is not on the agenda and the Conference
                            is not the forum in which to discuss specific US financial commitments
                            of either short or long duration. At the same time, the Head of
                            Delegation may agree to the general notion that both development and
                            population programs will require increased assistance from the developed
                            as well as the newly wealthy nations.</p>
                        <p>GENERAL POSITIONS </p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. recognizes that the World Population Conference is a forum
                            and recommendation body for population in its broadest aspects,
                            including the reciprocal effects of population and social and economic
                            change, environment and resources, and the quality of people's lives. We
                            further recognize that the personal, political, and developmental styles
                            of people will be affected by population factors.</p>
                        <p>2. We consider either/or discussions, particularly when drawn to the
                            length of development rather than family planning, futile and
                            unproductive. We consider family planning a complementary part of a
                            development strategy as well as being an essential human right with
                            benefits to both the persons affected directly and society at large.</p>
                        <p>3. We support the rising recognition of a need to arrive at stationary
                            populations ultimately.</p>
                        <p>4. We welcome the interdependence of nations, their mutual development
                            aims, and other global linkages.</p>
                        <p>5. We respect the reality of sovereignty and urge the recognition by
                            sovereign states of the interests of other nations and mankind in the
                            exercise of sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>6. We believe special attention is required in regard to human rights,
                            the status of women, and the fair treatment of all minority groups in
                            any population policy or program.</p>
                        <p>COMMITTEES </p>
                        <p>In addition to the Plenary the three Committees,</p>
                        <p>I. Population Change and Economic and Social Development,</p>
                        <p>II. Population, Resources, and Environment,</p>
                        <p>III. Population and the Family, </p>
                        <p>and the Working Group on the World Population Plan of Action will be
                            operating almost simultaneously August 20-26. Assignments to the
                            Committees and the Working Group will be for the duration of the
                            Conference and there will be no "floating" without the express
                            assignment by the Head of Delegation or the Chief of Staff. This will
                            require considerable discipline and coordination among the Delegation.
                            There will be a morning staff meeting daily.</p>
                        <p>The staff advisors assigned to the Plenary and Committees will be
                            responsible for preparing daily written reports and contributing to the
                            Final Report of the Delegation which is to be completed prior to
                            departure from Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATIONS OF CONFERENCE </p>
                        <p>1. The World Population Plan of Action should be the centerpiece of the
                            Conference and contain all recommendations.</p>
                        <p>2. Committees are likely to adopt resolutions regardless of any
                            pre-conference agreement to eliminate or restrict them. The U.S. should
                            seek to discourage resolutions, particularly when irrelevant to the
                            agenda item of the Committee. The U.S. should encourage the inclusion in
                            each Committee Report of views expressed or agreed upon. Furthermore,
                            the U.S. sees advantages in having the Committees review the portions of
                            the Plan of Action relevant to their agenda item, to comment on those
                            portions and forward their suggestions to the Working Group on the Plan
                            of Action together with any additional recommendations deemed
                            appropriate for the consideration of the Working Group.</p>
                        <p>3. The U.S. believes it is undesirable to have a declaration come from
                            the Conference as it is likely to divert attention from the Plan of
                            Action, otherwise distract the Conference, and possibly produce
                            irrelevancies and discord.</p>
                        <p>OVERALL OBJECTIVE </p>
                        <p>The U.S. seeks to move the Conference from a celebration of the
                            accomplished and accepted to a dedication to the difficult and
                            necessary. </p>

                            FACTORS TO DEVELOPMENT DOMINATED TONE OF PLENARY SESSIONS IN FIRST DAYS
                            OF DEBATES. DESPITE POLITICAL DISPARITIES, THEY FORCEFULLY EXPRESSED
                            THEIR BASIC IDOLOGICAL POSITION, I.E., ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE POPULATION
                            GROWTH PRIOR TO FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF SOCIETY AND SIGNIFICANT
                            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WERE TOTALLY FUTILE. SUBSTANTIVELY, STATEMENTS OF
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S WITH SOCIALIST VIEWPOINTS
                            CONCENTRATED HEAVILY ON SUPPLY SIDE OF SUPPLY-DEMAND EQUATION. THESE
                            GOVERNMENTS PRIMARILY FAVOR GROWTH OF PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND STILL
                            REGARD CONSUMPTION AS A SECONDARY CONCERN. TOWARD END OF PLENARY
                            DEBATES, AIR BECAME LESS CHARGED BECAUSE OF NUMBER OF BALANCING
                            STATEMENTS WHICH EFFECTIVELY FOCUSED ON POPULATION PLANNING AND BECAUSE

                        <p>A NOTABLE FEATURE OF MANY LDC STATEMENTS WAS APPRECIATION EXPRESSED FOR
                            VARIOUS TYPES OF UNFPA ASSISTANCE. WELL-TO-DO COUNTRIES WERE URGED TO
                            INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND. MANY LDC'S PARTICULARLY FROM
                            AFRICA, CAME TO CONFERENCE WITH PRIMARY INTENTION OF ADVANCING
                            PROVISIONS OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S "DECLARATION ON ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW
                            INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER." THEIR FAILURE AT THE CONFERENCE TO COME
                            TO GRIPS WITH PROBLEMS GENERATED BY RAPID POPULATION GROWTH IS NOT
                            LIKELY TO AFFECT THEIR DOMESTIC POPULATION POLICIES. MAJOR

                            RESOLUTIONS AND ITS OWN REPORT TO PLENARY. DISCUSSION WAS OCCASIONALLY
                            ANIMATED BUT NO PUBLIC ARGUMENTS DEVELOPED. CHAIRMAN RESLOVED
                            DISAGREEMENTS BY CALLING SHORT RECESSES DURING WHICH COMPROMISE FORMULAS
                            WERE DEVISED. NO VOTES WERE TAKEN; FEW RESERVATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED. TWO
                            TOPICS DOMINATED (1) "RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING IN
                            DEVELOPMENT PROCESS" AND (2) "WHY ALL COUNTRIES FAVOR IMPROVED STATUS OF
                            WOMEN". SOCIALIST VIEW OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE AS NECESSARY AND
                            SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR FERTILITY CHANGE DOMINATED DEBATE OF FIRST
                            TOPIC. BROAD SUPPORT FOR NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER WAS COMMON
                            CORROLARY. OPPOSING VIEW THAT BOTH FAMILY PLANNING AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT
                            EFFORTS ARE NEEDED PRESENTED COMPETENTLY, BUT SILENCE OF INDIA AND
                            PAKISTAN LENT CREDENCE TO VIEW THAT FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN
                            FAILURE. SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO NATIONAL FAMILY

                            STATUS OF WOMEN LED TO RAPID, UNCONFIDENTIAL CONTROVERTED COMMITMENT TO
                            BROAD RANGE OF ACTIONS TO CORRECT INEQUITIES. RESOLUTIONS LARGELY
                            RECOMMENDED GENERAL DEVELOPMENT MEASURES. THREE THAT MENTION FAMILY
                            PLANNING OR RELATED ACTIONS AND QUALIFIED TO INDICATE SUBORDINATE ROLE
                            OF THIS KIND OF ACTION. MOST RESOLUTIONS EMPHASIZE CONSIDERATION OF
                            POPULATION VARIABLES ONLY IN CONTEXT OF GENERAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.
                            ROMANIA'S SWEEPING RESOLUTION "FOR A MORE JUST WORLD" HAS SIGNIFICANCE
                            OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE MANDATE INASMUCH AS IT SERVED AS A THIRD WORLD
                            RALLYING POINT ON A BROAD RANGE OF GENERAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. EMPHASIS
                            ON RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN TWO RESOLUTIONS MAY BE MOST PRODUCTIVE
                            CONTRIBUTION OF COMMITTEE WORK INASMUCH AS ATTENTION IS THEREBY FOCUSED
                            ON POPULATIONS WITH HIGHEST FERTILITY AND GREATEST CULTURAL RESISTANCE

                            AND THREE RECOMMENDATIONS AND REFERRED LANGUAGE TO WPPA WORKING GROUP
                            DESIGNED TO STRESS NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. ALL
                            WERE ACCEPTED AFTER CONSIDERABLE DEBATE BUT NO VOTES AND NO
                            RESERVATIONS. COMMITTEE HEARD ARGUMENTS ON WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS NOT
                            PRESENTED IN THE BASIC CONFERENCE DOCUMENTS. COUNTRIES WITH SOCIAL AND
                            PLANNED ECONOMIES AND MANY DEVELOPING NATIONS IN AFRICA AND LATIN
                            AMERICA CLAIMED THAT COLONIALISM, IMPERIALISM AND NEO-COLONIALISM WERE

                            ALL CLAIMED THERE WERE PLENTY OF RESOURCES AND THAT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND
                            NATIONAL PLANNING THERE WILL BE NO RESOURCE SHORTAGES OR PROBLEMS. IN

                            AND FOOD SHORTAGES WHICH COUNTERED VERY EFFECTIVELY THIS POLITICAL TONE
                            AND BROUGHT FOCUS OF ATTENTION BACK TO POPULATION CONCERNS.</p>
                        <p>3 (C) COMMITTEE III - FAMILY - COMMITTEE ADOPTED, AFTER CONSIDERABLE
                            DEBATE AND MANY AMENDMENTS, SIX RESOLUTIONS OUT OF FOURTEEN SUBMITTED.
                            THIS WAS DONE WITHOUT VOTE. ONLY RESERVATION WAS US ON REFERENCE TO NEW
                            ECONOMIC ORDER IN ONE RESOLUTION. GENERAL DISCUSSION STRESSED RIGHT OF
                            INDIVIDUALS AND COUPLES TO DETERMINE NUMBER AND SPACING OF CHILDREN AND
                            ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND MEANS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION. IT EMPHASIZED
                            NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IN FORMULATION OF POPULATION POLICIES,
                            ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPORVEMENT OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES, EDUCATION
                            FOR MARRIAGE AND RESPONSIBLLITIES OF PARENTHOOD, EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATION
                            AND EDUCATION DEALING WITH ALL ASPECTS OF FAMILY PLANNING, AND
                            ATTAINMENT OF MORE EQUITABLE LIVING CONDITIONS AND BETTER QUALITY OF
                            LIFE FOR ALL PEOPLES. THE ELEVATION OF THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND THEIR
                            FULL PARTICIPATION AND INTEGRATION INTO DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL LIFE ON
                            AN EQUAL BASIS WITH MEN WAS CONSIDERED TO BE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN
                            DEVELOPMENT. THERE WAS A CONSENSUS AMONG DELEGATES THAT FAMILY PLANNING
                            ALONE AS A POLICY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT A
                            MULTI-DIMENSIONAL APPROACH IS THE KEY TO STEMMING POPULATION GROWTH.
                            ATTENTION WAS ALSO DIRECTED TO RURAL FAMILY AND RURAL POPULATIONS</p>
                        <p>4. WORKING GROUP ON WPPA- AFTER NINE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF NEGOTIATION AND
                            47 VOTES, WPPA IS, ON WHOLE, STRONG AND MEANINGFUL DOCUMENT, SUPPORTED
                            BY CONSENSUS DEVELOPED BY CAREFUL CONCILIATION AND BALANCE OF DIVERSE
                            VIEWPOINTS. WHILE EMPHASIS IS ON SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS ESSENTIAL,
                            EVEN A PREREQUISITE TO FERTILITY DECLINE, SUPPORT FOR FAMILY PLANNING AS
                            BASIC HUMAN AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE FAMILY SIZE, AS A HEALTH
                            MEASURE, AND AS LINK TO STATUS OF WOMEN ALSO STRENGTHENED DESPITE SOME

                            RETAINED THROUGH COMPROMISE LANGUAGE (PARAS 16, 17 AND 36 AND 36)
                            DEVELOPED BY US DEL WHICH ULTIMATELY WON STRONG SUPPORT. BACKING OF

                            GOVERNMENTS, AND FOUND SUPPORT ONLY FROM SWEDEN WHICH HAD CONSISTENTLY
                            AGREED WITH US NOT TO RAISE INSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS AT <gloss
                                target="#t_WPC1">WPC</gloss>. UNFPA'S ROLE IN WPPA WAS CONSIDERABLY

                        <p>5. POLITICAL ISSUES - WE CONSIDER IT ONE OF REAL SUCCESSES OF CONFERENCE
                            FROM US POINT OF VIEW THAT MATTER OF PRG NEVER CAME TO PLENARY AS AN
                            ACTION ITEM. DAILY BATTLES DID TAKE PLACE, BUT ALWAYS BEHIND SCENES AND
                            AT CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE WHERE ISSUE PRG AND GRUNK WAS DEFEATED 5 TO 4.
                            CONSIDERABLE CREDIT TO THIS SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME MUST BE GIVEN TO ROMANIAN
                            GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH THEY HAD MADE REPEATED EFFORTS PRIOR TO OPENING OF
                            CONFERENCE TO WORK OUT COMPROMISE SOLUTION WHICH WOULD ALLOW PRG TO
                            ATTEND, WHEN THIS FAILED THEY LENT THEIR CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT TO
                            SUPPORTING OUR CONTENTION THAT PRG SHOULD NOT BE PRESENT AND MATTER
                            SHOULD NOT DISRUPT MAIN WORK OF CONFERENCE ITSELF. THIS OBJECTIVE WAS
                            ACHIEVED. ON IMPORTANT FACTOR WHICH HELPED ACHIEVE THIS RESULT AND LIMIT
                            DAMAGE ON NEW ECONOMIC POLICY ISSUE WAS THAT FOR VAST MAJORITY OF
                            DELEGATES THIS WAS THEIR FIRST UN CONFERENCE. THEY WERE NOT FAMILIAR
                            WITH UN GROUND RULES AND NOT INTERESTED IN POLITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS PRG,
                            GRUNK OR NEW ECONOMIC ORDER.</p>
                        <p>6. NEW ECONOMIC POLICY - ANOTHER MAJOR BATTLE WAGED BEHIND SCENES HAD TO
                            DO WITH ALGERIANS AND OTHERS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO INSERT REFERENCES IN
                            CONFERENCE DOCUMENTATION TO OUTCOME OF 6TH SPECIAL SESSION OF <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. EXTREMELY LANGUAGE WAS EVENTUALLY
                            REJECTED IN ALL CASES. THERE ARE THREE REFERENCES IN WPPA: (1) PARA 1
                            WHICH REFERS TO ADOPTION OF PROGRAM OF ACTION BY 6TH SPECIAL SESSION,
                            (B) PARA 13 WHICH REFERS IN PASSING TO SPIRIT OF NEW INTERNATIONAL
                            ECONOMIC ORDER (LOWER CASE), AND (C) PARA 68 WHICH SAYS THAT PROGRAM OF
                            ACTION SHOULD LEAD TO REDUCTION IN WIDENING GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR.
                            US VOTED AGAINST REFERENCES MENTIONED (A) AND (C) AND LOST BY
                            OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A REFERENCE IN COMMITTEE
                            III'S RESOLUTION ON FAMILY AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH REAFFIRMS NEED TO
                            PROMOTE AT WORLD LEVEL A NEW ECONOMIC ORDER (LOWER CASE) IN ACCORDANCE
                            WITH FINAL DECISION ADOPTED AT 6TH SPECIAL SESSION. THERE IS A PARAGRAPH
                            IN REPORT OF THIRD COMMITTEE IN WHICH US FORMALLY RESERVED ON THIS
                            LANGUAGE. SECRETARY WEINBERGER, IN HIS CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE PLENARY,
                            ALSO SAID "RESERVATIONS EXPRESSED AT TIME OF ADOPTION BY 6TH SPECIAL
                            SESSION STILL REMAIN VALID TODAY".</p>
                        <p>7. COUNTRY STANCES - MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENTS MAINTAINED GENERAL POSITIONS
                            TOWARD SUBJECT MATTER OF CONFERENCES WHICH THEY HAD EXPRESSED AT
                            POPULATION COMMISSION AND IN PRE-CONFERENCE MEETINGS. GENERALIZING,
                            ASIAN COUNTRIES WERE MOST AWARE OF POPULATION PROBLEMS, AFRICAN
                            COUNTRIES ARE SLOWLY BECOMING AWARE OF PROBLEM. THEY LEARNED MUCH AT
                            THIS CONFERENCE AND WERE LESS ACCUSATIVE THAN EXPECTED. SOME COUNTRIES
                            IN LATIN AMERICA ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE ON FAMILY PLANNING ISSUES. EUROPE
                            AND NORTH AMERICA ARE PUSHING GLOBAL ACTION WHILE EASTERN EUROPE IS
                            PUTTING ITS COLLECTIVE HEAD IN SAND. THERE WERE SOME SURPRISES, HOWEVER.
                            BRAZIL HAS DONE A TURN-AROUND AND ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT FOR FAMILY
                            PLANNING PROGRAMS WHILE ARGENTINA (WITH LOWEST BIRTH RATE IN LATION
                            AMERICA) OVERNIGHT TURNED PRO-NATALIST WITH A VICIOUSNESS AND
                            AGGRESSIVENESS THAT STARTLED EVERYONE. ALGERIA REMAINED BLATANT ON ALL
                            SUBJECTS. INDIA WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE IT RARELY SPOKE OUT,
                            WAS HURTFUL SEVERAL TIMES WHEN IT DID AND OFTEN VOTED WRONG. IRAN AND
                            PHILIPPINES TOOK MAJOR POSITIVE ROLE AMONG LDC'S JOINED BY BANGLADESH,
                            THAILAND AND INDONESIA. HOLY SEE WAS ONLY ENTITY PRESENT WHICH ANNOUNCED
                            IN PLENARY AFTER PLAN HAD BEEN ADOPTED THAT "WE ARE NOT A PART OF THE
                            CONSENSUS OF THIS CONFERENCE - WE DO NOT COMPROMISE, OUR VIEWS ARE KNOWN
                            AND WE MAINTAIN THEM". SWEDEN TRIED TO DOMINATE EUROPEANS BUT DID NOT
                            SUCCEED. UK AND CANADA WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF US POSITION; FRG ONLY
                            OCCASIONALLY. JAPAN AT LAST SPOKE OUT AT END. CHINA MADE SAME ATTACK ON
                            "SUPER-POWERS" 5-6 TIMES DURING CONFERENCE, TILTING SLIGHTLY AGAINST
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> BY VIRTUE OF SPECIAL MENTION
                            OF "SOCIAL IMPERIALISM" AND "THAT SUPER-POWER WHICH LABELS ITSELF
                            SOCIALIST." CHINA WAS SOUNDLY DEFEATED ON ITS TWO FORMAL AMENDMENTS AND
                            EXERCISED NO THIRD WORLD LEADERSHIP WHATSOEVER.</p>
                        <p>8. SECRETARIAT - DURING SECOND WEEK OF CONFERENCE, UN SECRETARIAT SETTLED
                            INTO ROUTINE AND WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IN COPING WITH MECHANICS AND
                            DOCUMENTATION OF CONFERENCE. CARRILLO-FLORES,SECRETARY GENERAL OF
                            CONFERENCE, REMAINED CONSISTENT, HOWEVER, IN THAT HE AT NO TIME ASSUMED
                            LEADERSHIP ROLE DURING COURSE OF MEETING. HE EVEN REFUSED US DEL'S
                            REQUEST TO GET REPRESENTATIVES FROM THREE COMMITTEES TOGETHER IN EFFORT
                            TO MERGE DRAFT RESOLUTIONS FROM DIFFERENT COMMITTEES WHICH OVERLAPPED
                            AND DUPLICATED EACH OTHER. CARRILLO-FLORES ANNOUNCED HIS "IRREVOCABLE
                            DECISION" TO RESIGNE FROM UN AT END YEAR WHEN HIS DUTIES ARE COMPLETED.
                            HIGH MARKS SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR OUTSTANDING WORK DONE THROUGHOUT
                            CONFERENCE BY <persName corresp="#p_SRM2">RAPHAEL SALAS</persName>, HEAD
                            OF UNFPA, AND HIS STAFF, AND ECAFE SECRETARIAT STAFF UNDER LEADERSHIP

                            HAVE BEEN FAR, FAR LESS EFFECTIVE.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_NGO1">NGO</gloss>'S - REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME 300
                            NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN BUCHAREST DURING
                            INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, ATTENDING NGO TRIBUNE. ELEVEN HUNDRED
                            OTHER PERSONS REGISTERED AT TRIBUNE. OF THIS TOTAL NUMBER, SOME 300 WERE
                            AMERICAN. US DEL ASSIGNED ONE OF ITS MEMBERS FULL-TIME RESPOSIBILITY TO
                            ACT AS LIAISON WITH US NGO'S. TWO FORMAL SESSIONS WERE HELD WITH NUMBER
                            OF MEMBERS OF US DEL PRESENT. AT FIRST MEETING 100 NGO'S ATTENDED WHILE
                            AT SECOND OVER 200 ATTENDED. IN ADDITION TO NUMBER OF INFORMAL CONTACTS
                            BY ALL MEMBERS OF US DEL THROUGHOUT CONFERENCE, INTERESTED US NGO'S WERE
                            ALS O INVITED TO ATTEND DAILY PRESS BRIEFINGS IF THEY SO DESIRED. US DEL
                            ALSO MET WITH US NGO STEERING COMMITTEE TO TALK OF FUTURE NGO SUPPORT
                            FOR POPULATION MATTERS. </p>
                        <p>10. PRESS - THERE WERE SOME 800 PRESS ACCREDITED TO THE CONFERENCE AND
                            VARIOUS MEMBERS OF US DEL WERE CONSTANTLY REQUESTED TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL
                            INTERVIEWS. IN GENERAL, PRESS WAS HIGHLY UNINFORMED ABOUT UN CONFERENCES
                            IN GENERAL AND POPULATION IN PARTICULAR. IN EFFORT FOCUS TIME SPENT ON
                            PRESS, SECRETARY WEINBERGER OR GOVERNOR <persName corresp="#p_PRW2"
                                >PETERSON</persName> HELD PRESS BRIEFINGS DAILY THROUGHOUT ENTIRE
                            CONFERENCE AT 6:30 P.M. AT INTER-CONTINENTAL HOTEL. THESE NORMALLY
                            LASTED ONE HOUR, WERE EXTREMELY WELL ATTENDED AND PROVIDED AN EFFECTIVE
                            CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH PRESS. EMBASSY WAS VERY HELPFUL IN THIS
                            REGARD AND FACILITATED PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF US DEL
                            RELEASES.</p>

                            ORGANIZE AND DID FINANCE PUBLICATION OF DAILY NEWSPAPER DURING COURSE OF
                            CONFERENCE CALLED "PLANET" - "REPORTING DAILY ON THE WORLD POPULATION
                            CONFERENCE AND POPULATION TRIBUNE". THIS EIGHT-PAGE NEWSPAPER, PRINTED
                            WITH HELP OF ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT FACILITIES, WAS AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE
                            INSTRUMENT IN KEEPING ALL PERSONS ATTENDING BUCHAREST CONFERENCES
                            INFORMED OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS CATALYST PROVIDING EFFECTIVE
                            INTER-ACTION BETWEEN NGO TRIBUNE AND CONFERENCE ITSELF. US DEL WAS
                            ALREADY PROPOSED TO MR. ROY JACKSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL, FAO, THAT

                            CONFERENCE) BE PART OF UN'S FOOD CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER IN ROME.</p>
                        <p>12. TRIBUNE - THE POPULATION TRIBUNE, ORGANIZED BY NGO'S WHO ARE IN
                            CONSULTATIVE STATUS WITH <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>, MET
                            IN PARALLET BUT SEPARATE MEETINGS DURING COURSE OF TWO WEEK WPC. THERE
                            WAS STRONG INTERACTION BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS AT TRIBUNE AND INDIVIDUAL
                            GOVERNMENT DELEGATIONS ATTENDING WPC. TRIBUNE SERVED AS EFFECTIVE
                            SOUNDING BOARD FOR IDEAS WHICH GOVERNMENT'S OFTEN DID NOT EXPLORE AT WPC
                            ITSELF. IT WAS WELL ORGANIZED, WELL ATTENDED AND PROFESSIONAL IN ITS
                            OUTLOOK. IT WAS NOT TAKEN OVER, AS WAS ITS STOCKHOLM COUNTER-PART, BY
                            ANY DISSIDENT ELEMENTS AND MAINTAINED AS BASIC PROFESSIONALISM WHICH WAS
                            CREDIT TO ITS ORGANIZERS. US DEL WAS PROPOSED TO US NGO STEERING
                            COMMITTEE THAT IT CONTACT WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE SECRETARIAT IN ORDER
                            FIND MEANINGFUL ROLE AT ROME CONFERENCE. </p>

                            BUCHAREST, WAS GENEARALLY CONSIDERED BY SOME PARTICIPANTS AND MOST
                            NON-PARTICIPANTS TO HAVE BEEN DISASTER. SOLE DOCUMENT COMING OUT OF
                            YOUTH MEETING (SEE BUCHAREST 3840) WAS REALLY NON-DOCUMENT WITH NO

                            SPIRIT. DAILY MORNING STAFF MEETINGS WERE ESSENTIAL PART OF EXCHANGE OF
                            INFORMATION AND AFFORED OPPORTUNITY FOR GENERAL GUIDANCE ON POLICY
                            ISSUES. SIZE OF DEL WAS BOUT RIGHT. EXPERTISE LEVEL WAS HIGH AND NEEDED.
                            AT ONE POINT NINE DIFFERENT MEETINGS WERE TAKING PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY
                            AND FACT THAT US DEL COULD COVER ALL MEANT THAT WE HAD IMPORTANT IMPACT
                            NOT ONLY ON DAY-TO-DAY NEGOTIATIONS BUT ON VERALL OUTCOME OF
                            CONFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>15. US POSTURE - US DEL RECEIVED NUMEROUS, UNSOLCITED COMMENTS AT END OF
                            CONFERENCE EVEN FROM SUCH CRITICS AS SWEDES, CANADIANS AND NGO'S, THAT
                            US POSTURE AND TIMING AT CONFERENCE WERE "JUST RIGHT". IN FACT US DEL
                            WAS "SUBTLE, NOT BLATANT", AND DID TAKE QUIET LEADERSHIP ROLE,
                            PARTICULARLY IN WPPA WORKING GROUP. WE WERE NOT AFRAID OF A VOTE (ALMOST
                            50 TAKEN IN WORKING GROUP BUT NONE IN PLENARY) AND DID NOT GROUSE OVER
                            OCCASIONAL DEFEATS. ORIGINAL STRATEGY OF URGING GOALS AND TARGETS WAS
                            EFFECTIVE SINCE THIS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO COMPROMISE DOWNWARD AND TO HAVE
                            SOLID WPPA LEFT.</p>

                        <p>THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE WASHINGTON, D.C. 20201 </p>
                        <p>September 19, 1974</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE</p>
                        <p>It was my privilege to head the U.S. Delegation to the World Population
                            Conference in Bucharest, Romania, from August 19-30, 1974. You will
                            receive an unclassified report that covers the Conference in some
                            detail, including the major issues considered by the participants and
                            the accomplishments that the Delegation believes were achieved. You will
                            alo receive a briefing memorandum on the Conference prepared by your
                            Special Assistant for Population Matters, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CPP1">Philander Claxton</persName>. I will, therefore,
                            limit this report to my own impressions of the Conference, other
                            delegations, and my meetings with various officials in Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>The Conference was extremely well planned and organized -- a tribute to
                            the Conference Secretary General, Sr. Carillo-Flores of Mexico, and U.N.
                            Secretariat officials. The physical arrangements in Bucharest were also
                            excellent, including translation services, unobtrusive security, etc.,
                            all of which were provided by the Romanian Organizing Committee. I
                            believe the daily morning meeting of the Delegation, which I called, and
                            the daily evening press briefing we held, helped bind our Delegation
                            together and helped, it to work effectively. Our Delegation met each
                            morning to exchange views on various issues and to receive instructions.
                            We also enjoyed outstanding support from the Embassy staff, an essential
                            ingredient to our success.</p>
                        <p>After the first few days of the Conference, the Delegation decided that
                            our policy of maintaining a low profile was unproductive, and that a
                            more active role should be taken. One result of this posture was
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Chris Herter's</persName> rebuttal to
                            the Soviet assertion in the Committee on Environment that the world
                            could support 35 billion people if only all nations would adopt a
                            controlled, socialist economy. In his remarks, a copy of which is
                            attached, he cited the record of the Russian grain importation, to which
                            the Soviets only replied that they had had bad weather. Our higher
                            visibility also enabled us to argue points and insist on votes on
                            debatable issues in the working group on the. World Population Plan of
                            Action (<gloss target="#t_WPPA1">WPPA</gloss>). This attitude resulted
                            in a quiet leadership role by the U.S. Delegation, on which we received
                            many compliments.</p>
                        <p>Despite our daily press conference, which was well attended and during
                            which most of the substantive items before the Conference were
                            discussed, (and which incidentally was held principally to help the
                            press cover a difficult story), the press continued to report the
                            Conference as a failure, and to highlight the polemics of the Communist
                            and Third World countries. Even now, with the WPPA available as adopted,
                            'here appears little appreciation of the fact of the Plan's adoption by
                            acclamation or of the striking similarity between the adopted text and
                            the preliminary draft. The press seemed intent on reporting failure
                            because we did not secure agreement that all nations would immediately
                            reduce their birth rates. I believe the agreement that was achieved
                            represents very significant progress in an area on which few believed
                            more than a handful of nations would ever meet, let alone agree on
                            anything. By comparison with the Law of the Sea Conference, for example,
                            where no agreement was achieved on anything, Bucharest could be said to
                            be an unqualified success.</p>
                        <p>The Population Tribune, with some 1400 representatives of
                            non-governmental organizations from around the world (including 300 from
                            the United States) , met concurrently with the Conference. Our
                            delegation maintained excellent liaison with the Tribune, and Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRW2">Peterson</persName> and I both spoke to
                            a gathering of many of the representatives arranged by the Embassy's
                            Cultural Affairs Officer.</p>
                        <p>I represented the Delegation in the Plenary sessions of the Conference,
                            where major statements where made by participants. On the opening day,
                            at our request, I was recognized to resent President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>'s greetings, and what was, in
                            effect, his first message to the world in conference assembled.
                            Socialist theories on the relationship of population factors to
                            development dominated the early sessions. Toward the end of Plenary
                            debates, the air became less charged because of a number of balancing
                            statements that effectively focused on population planning and because
                            of a somewhat flagging interest of the delegates to the Plenary itself.
                            Our major disappointment in the Plenary was that -- despite strong and
                            relevant statements by the U.N. Secretary-General, the Secretary-General
                            of the Conference, and <gloss target="#t_NGO1">NGO</gloss>
                            representatives on the important linkage between poverty, food shortage,
                            and. the growing population problem and the need for governments to take
                            political action -- the Plenary statements by a great majority of
                            cuntries had almost no sense of urgency.</p>
                        <p>The major activity of the Conference was carried out in three committees
                            and the working group on the World Population Plan of Action, which met
                            concurrently with the Plenary. The committees -- on development, the
                            environment, and the family -- accomplished their work in a spirit of
                            cooperation, often reacting agreement on resolutions by consensus rather
                            than by vote.</p>
                        <p>The working group on the WPPA achieved what is, I believe, a strong and
                            meaningful document, supported by a consensus that was developed through
                            careful conciliation and balance of diverse viewpoints. When it became
                            apparent that references to family planning and fertility related goals
                            would come under strong attack, especially from the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the Holy See, we secured
                            "compromise" language, that included the concept of sovereign nations
                            setting their own quantitative goals and trying thereby to reach
                            specific population growth rates by 1985, which in many ways was
                            stronger, in its result, than the preliminary draft.</p>
                        <p>We were able to prevail on two important "housekeeping" issues. One was
                            to prevnt any new institutional of funding arrangements within the U.N.
                            structure to deal with population matters. The other was to prevent the
                            question of <gloss target="#t_PRGSV1">PRG</gloss> representation at the
                            Conference from coming before the Plenary. The matter was settled in the
                            Credentials Committee, where the Romanian Government, after having
                            failed to chieve a compromise solution prior to the opening of the
                            Conference, supported our contention that the PRG should not be present
                            and the matter should not interfere with the main work of the Conference
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>The Algerins and other countries constantly sought to insert references
                            in Conference documentation to the "new economic order" -- an outcome of
                            the 6th Special Session of the Genral Assembly. Although extreme
                            language was eventually rejected, there are three references in the
                            WPPA. When the U.S. voted against these insertions, we lost by an
                            overwhelming majority. In my closing statement to the Plenary, I
                            reaffirmed the reservations on this matter made by the United States at
                            the 6th Special Session.</p>
                        <p>I also pointed out the inconsistency in that those nations pushing for
                            the "new international economic order" which purposefull "requires"
                            certain action on an international level without regard to individual
                            sovereignty, were the same nation who opposed population reduction
                            resolutions because the interfered with "national sovereignty."</p>
                        <p>A critical impasse of the Conference -- when we were likely to be
                            isolated against the Third World -- took place in Plenary the next to
                            last day of the Conference. At that time the Africans tried to push
                            through three resolutions on decolonization, apartheid, and the funding
                            of travel. of liberation movements. I rose in the Plenary on a point of
                            order and complained that the three resolutions had only been circulated
                            that morning, thereby violating the 24- hour rule about distribution of
                            resolutions. I pointed out that I was only expressing procedural rather
                            than substantive concerns, but since the issues in the three resolutions
                            had not been discussed by any Conference committee, were not on the
                            Conference agenda, and did not relate to the Conference, and since we
                            had no information about.the resolutions and no instructions, I urged
                            that the Chair rule that the resolutions were out of order and should be
                            forwarded to the 29th General Assembly of the United Nations without
                            action by this Conference.</p>
                        <p>I made the point to the Plenary and later, with great emphasis, to
                            Conference President Macovescu, that if this loose procedure were
                            followed, there would be no way we could finish the next day and no
                            limit to the number or subject matter of resolutions that could be taken
                            up.</p>
                        <p>Conference President Macovescu adjourned the Plenary for 30 minutes while
                            he held consultations with the U.S. Delegation, some 25 Black African
                            representatives, Algeria, Cuba, and the Secretariat. He secured what he
                            believed was virtually a commitment from the Africans that no more
                            resolutions would be introduced by them, and he then advised the U.S.
                            Delegation representatives that he was prepared to rule the three
                            resolutions were in order and that we would have to challenge and try to
                            overrule his ruling by a vote on the competence of the Conference to
                            discuss these issues. It was clear that we would be heavily outvoted on
                            this point if such a vote were taken.</p>
                        <p>He controlled the rather volatile Africans in a calm and collected manner
                            and finally, urged the U.S. Delegation to accept his oral assurance that
                            these resolutions could be validly discussed by the Conference since it
                            was in effect the draft of its own rules of procedure. He also advised
                            me personally that he was confident no other resolutions would be
                            introduced and he proved to be right about this. The Chairman then
                            reconvened the Plenary and ruled that the resolution could be discussed
                            and all three were adopted without a vote.</p>
                        <p>I would strongly recommend that for the future we try to secure adoption
                            of a procedure which precludes the quick introduction of such
                            resolutions and the by-passing of formal committee consideration of each
                            resolution. The lack of rules at the Population Conference did permit
                            such loose procdure, and if more resolutions had come in, the whole two
                            weeks work of the committee might have been undermined -- so perhaps our
                            point of order helped block such an unfortunate result.</p>
                        <p>As I noted earlier, the Romanian Government had made special efforts to
                            ensure the success of the Conference. Romania eagerly sought the World
                            Population Conference as part or its overall strategy of attracting as
                            much international activity a possible to its capital. To the extent the
                            GOR can build up United Nations or other international presence in
                            Bucharest, its independence from Soviet hegemony is quietly enhanced,
                            and another deterrent to Soviet bullying is put in place. Consequently,
                            Romania's commitment to the success of the Conference was the
                            predominant factor in GOR behavior, and an all-out: effort was made to
                            leave delegations with memories of Romanian diplomatic skill, of good
                            feeling, and of conference accomplishments. At the same time, the GOR
                            took pains to balance and reconcile this concern with the other faces of
                            its foreign policy - relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and, the East European camp, the industrialized West,
                            the Third World and particularly the radical. non-aligned.</p>
                        <p>Romania's competition with its socialist brethren was most marked whe the
                            GOR mounted a pre-conference effort in Washington New York, and Geneva,
                            urging the United States to allow the PRG to be invited to attend the
                            Conference in some capacity or other. This campaign peaked when State
                            Council Vice President Bodnaras talked about "conference trouble" unless
                            the United States softened its stand. In fact serious difficulties did
                            not materialize since the non-aligned were not sure that they could win
                            a conference vote on this issue.</p>
                        <p>After the Conference started, the GOR played a reasonably positive role
                            from the standpoint of the United States. While they were not adverse to
                            trying to persuade us to take positions we might not otherwise adopt,
                            they did make the most of their limited ability to control what went on
                            at the Conference and clearly were able to moderate the wild impulses of
                            the non-aligned. This moderating effect was carried out in spite of the
                            fact that it might somewhat tarnish their own pretentious with regard to
                            the Third World fraternity.</p>
                        <p>Romania's Plenary statement was a soft-sell version of the
                            "non-Malthusian" credo. Romania's "better world" resolution in Committee
                            I (development) omitted "socialist" rhetoric, and was an attempt to
                            construct a reasonable consensus without Soviet participation.</p>
                        <p>In the working group drafting the World Population Plan of Action, the
                            Romanians spoke out very little and remained almost invisible. The GOR
                            played no broker role in the working group. In voting on separate
                            amendments, Romania regularly separated itself from the Soviet Union and
                            associated East European states and more often than not sided with the
                            Algiers non-aligned. On one key working group vote for example, when a
                            compromise among the Holy See, China and Great Britain was assaulted by
                            a competitive Byelorussian proposal, the Romanians sided with the
                            former. When the Czech delegate spoke, in the final day's Plenary round
                            of speeches in the name of the USSR and Eastern European countries, he
                            omitted the name of Romania - but this was perhaps because his remarks
                            were in part a thank-you statement to the Conference host. At an earlier
                            point, when the USSR p rported to speak for all Eastern European
                            countries in the Credentials Committee, a Romanian delegate privately
                            asserted that "Romania lets no one speak for her in this way."</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it should be pointed out that Romanian officials were
                            consistently courteous, polite and helpful to their U.S. counterparts,
                            and the U.S. Delegation usually go early warning -- although sometimes
                            not all that early -- about what it faced next from the non-aligned.</p>
                        <p>The Holy See had a strong delegation and seemed to have representativies
                            in every committee, working group and subgroup meeting. Although often
                            uncompromising and outspoken, they nevertheless made several
                            constructive contributions in regard to responsible parenthood. The two
                            particular amendments to the WPPA that they put forward were soundly
                            defeated, but they did not give up. Their representative was the only
                            person in the Plenary, after the WPPA was adopted by acclamation, to
                            announce that the Holy See was not a part of the consensus of this
                            Conference. In fact, the speaker said this three times in his address
                            and said, in addition, "We do not compromise, our views are known and we
                            maintain them."</p>
                        <p>The Chinese lashed out repetitively at both "imperialism" and
                            "hegemonism" throughout the Conference and blamed the world's ills on
                            the superpowers (without naming them like the Albanians). However,
                            Chinese invective tilted against the USSR by virtue of special mention
                            of "social imperialism" (one whole paragraph in Plenary speech) and of
                            "that super-power which labels itself socialist." The USSR, generally
                            rebutted Chinese polemics in low-key fashion or had -somebody else do
                            it, as when the Czechs countered a Chinese jab at the 1968 invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia or (in the final day's speech) when they maintained for
                            the record that "imperialism" was the problem, not those others who ad
                            selflessly helped the Third World always. On the final day after the
                            usual Chinese blast at the "two superpowers, one of which calls itself
                            Socialist," the USSR delegates, seated in front of us, turned around.
                            and shook hands with some of the U.S. Delegation.</p>
                        <p>A majority of the countries of the developing world maintained the same
                            general positions towards the subject matter of the Conference that they
                            had expressed at the regional pre-Conference meetings. Generalizing, one
                            could say that the Asians are the most aware of their population
                            problems. The African countries are slowly becoming aware of the
                            problem, but at this Conference they were less accusative of the West
                            than we had expected, and I believe they learned much at this Conference
                            about the seriousness of the problem. Some countries in Latin America
                            are beginning to move on family planning issues.</p>
                        <p>There were some real surprises. Brazil has done a complete turn-around
                            with regard to its population policy and at the Conferenc announced its
                            support for domestic family planning programs. Argentina, which has one
                            of the lowest birth rates in Latin America, almost overnight has turned
                            pronatalist, a position that caught almost everyone at the Conference
                            unawares. India was a major disappointment, since it rarely spoke out.
                            Although India and Pakistan generally supported the U.S. position, their
                            support was neither consistant nor strong. Corridor gossip had it that
                            both countries were under orders not to offend the Chinese. Iran and the
                            Philippines consistently both took major positive leadership roles and
                            were frequently joined by Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Algeria remained blatant on all subjects at all times. They were not
                            particularly interested in population but strove successfully to obtain
                            the chairmanship of the working group on the World Population Plan of
                            Action. They used this as a platform, particularly for their ideas on
                            the new economic order, the statement of principles and the Program o
                            Action that came out of the 6th Special Session of the General Assembly.
                            For the future we should make major, pre-Conference efforts to get
                            enough votes to elect decent chairmen for all major committees. The fact
                            that we got a reasonable agreement at the Conference despite the
                            Algerians is more of a tribute to our Delegation than anything else. </p>
                        <p>The general Third World and African bloc theory that we should cut our
                            consumption so as to be able to supply them, is quite fallacious from a
                            number of viewpoints, as I pointed out to them at various opportunities.
                            First, if we cut our consumption, that inevitably, under our system,
                            means a cut in production which can only harm our critics. Second, it is
                            hardly realistic to expect that our response to their constant, pounding
                            criticism will be to cut our consumption to ensure them free food.
                            Third, they appear to have quite overlooked the fact that we have
                            already given in excess of $30 billion worth of free food to our less
                            fortunate neighbors.</p>
                        <p>While in Bucharest, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of
                            Romanian Government officials, including President Ceausescu, Prime
                            Minister Manea Manescu, Foreign Minister George Macovescu, Vice
                            President of the State Council Emil Bodnaras, the Minister of Health,
                            Dr. Theodor Burghele, and the Minister of Education and Instruction,
                            Paul Niculescu-Mizil. All of these meetings were cordial, and each
                            official with whom I spoke assured me of the satisfaction; the GOR feels
                            for the way relations with the United States are developing. Full
                            reports on all of these meetings have been submitted to your
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>As you know, was in Geneva visiting the World Health Organization during
                            the celebration of the 30th Anniversary of Romanian Liberation. Governor
                            Russell Peterson, vice chairman of the Delegation, represented the
                            United States at the Celebration, and had an opportunity to talk at some
                            length with Premier Kosygin, vice Premier Li Sieu Nieu of China, and
                            President and Mrs. Ceausescu. His report on those conversations
                            (Bucharest telegram 3769) is extremely interesting, and I recommend it
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>In my statement to the closing Plenary session, I said we went to
                            Bucharest to deal with one of the most serious problems that will
                            confront mankind for the rest of this century. The World Population Plan
                            of Action that we adopted to help solve those problems was not a victory
                            or defeat for any faction, nation, or group of nations. Rather, it was a
                            triumph tor the process of international ccoperation under the United
                            Nations.</p>

                            and Overseas Interests</p>
                        <p>In response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 200, I am forwarding
                            for your consideration the enclosed study on worldwide population growth
                            and U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>Scope</p>
                        <p>The study looks to the year 2000 and beyond on the basis of alternative
                            projections for population growth:</p>
                        <p>-- Part One examines the nature of the problem in its demographic,
                            economic, resource and national security aspects;</p>
                        <p>-- Part Two sets forth a comprehensive global population strategy and
                            policy recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The executive summary at the beginning of the study presents an overview
                            of the problem and the proposed strategy.</p>
                        <p>Population Growth and Its Implications </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> medium population projection -- the
                            projection used for anticipating food requirements-- forecasts world
                            population growth from 3.9 billion today to 6.4 billion by the year 2000
                            and over 11 billion y 2050. This is a relatively optimistic projection.
                            Holding growth within these limits will require expanded population
                            growth control programs.</p>
                        <p>Regional imbalances of growth will be very severe. There is a sharp
                            differentiation between rich countries and poor, the latter growing at
                            2.0 to 3.5 percent compared to developed countries at 0 to 1.5 percent.
                            The population of some developing areas will more than double by the
                            year 2000. The enormous built-in momentum of population growth resulting
                            from the extreme youthfulness of populations in developing countries
                            makes the development of population growth control programs a matter of
                            urgency.</p>
                        <p>Such growth rates have already generated serious problems for most
                            developing countries, especially the poorest, fastest growing; these
                            problems will become worse as populations continue to expand.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most serious challenge from both a humanitarian and a
                            national interest viewpoint will be adequacy of world food supplies for
                            the developing countries as populations press against limits of
                            available land, water, capital and resources inputs. Crop faiures
                            anywhere will raise the possibility of massive famines in parts of the
                            developing world. The resulting disruption and instability can threaten
                            economic growth and world order. The Department of Agriculture estimates
                            that, if the population of the developing countries increases at the
                            rate of the UN medium projection for the year 2000, their annual import
                            requirement for cereals will rise to more than 100 million tons by that
                            year, even if by great efforts they also increase their indigenous food
                            production by the amounts likely. This quantity of imports will be well
                            beyond their ability to purchase and will exceed any practicable
                            capacity for transportation and distribution. Their only alternative
                            will be to abandon any improvement in nutrition over present levels, to
                            accept a marked rise in death rates (particularly of infants and
                            children), to increase their food production by amounts greater than now
                            believed practicable, or to reduce their population growth more rapidly
                            than the UN medium projection. A global replacement level of fertility
                            (a two-child family on the average) by the year 2000 would hold
                            developing country populations 500 million below the UN medium
                            projection by 2000 and 3 billion below it in 2050, thereby reducing
                            developing country food import requirements by an equivalent amount.</p>
                        <p>Excessive population growth holds back economic development and seriously
                            affects per capita incomes and social progress. Thus failure of
                            developmental goals can bring mounting frustrations, increase
                            North-South tensions, and lead to political instability, violence, and
                            conflict within individual countries and among the developing
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>While we do not foresee serious problems of availabi ity of non-renewable
                            minerals as a result of population growth alone such growth will make it
                            increasingly difficult for the poorest developing countries to pay for
                            needed raw materials and energy. Their requirements for vital imports
                            could affect the U.S. both through their requests for financial support
                            and their efforts to obtain higher prices for their exports. </p>
                        <p>Proposed Strategy </p>
                        <p>The study recommends a comprehensive strategy focusing on:</p>
                        <p>a) Support of the UN World Population Plan of Action adopted at the
                            Bucharest Conference, plus a global target of replacement fertility
                            levels by the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>b) The engagement of the developing countries themselves and their
                            political leaders in efforts to moderate population growth, since
                            success is only possible from internal commitment. We must be constantly
                            aware of resistance by the leadership of some countries and by vocal
                            elements in other countries to US activities in this field.</p>
                        <p>c) A bilateral and multilateral assistance strategy emphasizing:</p>
                        <p>(1) priority to 13 key countries which contribute almost half of the
                            present population growth;</p>
                        <p>(2) delivery of family planning information and services to all fertile
                            couples at the earliest possible time;</p>
                        <p>(3) within our general social and economic program those elements which
                            are most conducive to reducing fertility; and</p>
                        <p>(4) increased funding for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> population
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>d) Increased funding and support for a worldwide effort for research in
                            human reproduction and development of low-cost, efficient and acceptable
                            fertility control methods.</p>
                        <p>e) US participation with other donor countries and UN agencies in
                            a-cooperative endeavor to develop systems for the delivery of basic
                            health services including family planning to poorer developing
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>f) A major worldwide effort of education about population growth and
                            family planning.</p>
                        <p>g) Increased provision for food aid, stockpiling for shortages and
                            agricultural assistance as a vital element in any successful population
                            strategy. Increases in food availability and improved nutrition are
                            equally important in any total strategy aimed at solving future
                            population and food imbalances. Our food policy is being actively
                            addressed separately in the follow-up to the World Food Conference.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations </p>
                        <p>Population growth and related factors require both high level attention
                            and continuing review and updating. There are no simple solutions. Added
                            funding will be required to make a significant impact.</p>
                        <p>The study's recommendations in this respect are subject to changing
                            circumstances. Above all, however, the problem must be recognized by the
                            developing countries themselves.</p>
                        <p>All U.S. efforts should be undertaken in such a way as to minimize
                            criticism that they are directed against the interests of the developing
                            countries. Therefore, the proposed stresses the development of the
                            well-being and economic progress of the poorest countries It may,
                            however, be necessary to weigh conflicting U.S. interests in the case of
                            particular countries.</p>
                        <p>Taking the foregoing consideration into account, the Under Secretaries
                            Committee recommends that you endorse the proposed global population
                            strategy presented above and amplified in the attached study. </p>
                        <p>Because this strategy involves complex and difficult questions, including
                            questions related to our political and security interests, and because a
                            number of different agencies of the government have an interest in this
                            matter, the Under Secretaries Committee, with the exception of AID, also
                            recommends that you assign to the Committee responsibility for
                            monitoring policy aspects of implementation of the strategy for
                            conducting an annual review of progress, and for ecommending to you any
                            significant changes which ma be needed.</p>
                        <p>The Agency for International Development believes that, when established,
                            the Development Coordination Committee (DCC) chaired by the AID
                            Administrator should be assigned this responsibility. AID believes this
                            will ensure that population policy is addressed in a development
                            context, which in its view, based on its experience, is the best way to
                            minimize the political sensitivities of many countries on this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>These alternatives are discussed in the Executive Summary of the attached
                            study.</p>
                        <p>As Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee, I believe that the
                            continuing review of population strategy in relation to our overall
                            national interests, which this Committed is prepared to undertake if you
                            so desire, could assist in providing a broad policy framework within
                            which interested bodies might most effectively pursue their
                            responsibilities respecting specific aspects of this major task.</p>

                        <p>REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF
                            WORLD POPULATION YEAR</p>
                        <p>From the outset, the National Commission for the Observance of World
                            Population Year has understood that the world population problem is a
                            complex one, involving some of the deepest instincts and emotions of the
                            human experience as well as some of the most important decisions that
                            face the international community.</p>
                        <p>As we set about our study of the problem, which involved wide-ranging
                            background reading, discussions, and presentations by experts, we were
                            impressed that many other major issues confronting the world's leaders
                            are significantly affected by world population trends. Among them are
                            questions of the supply of food, consumption of energy and other natural
                            resources, protection of the environment, economic and social
                            development of peoples and nations, employment and unemployment, and the
                            changing status of women. (Detailed in Appendix A.)</p>
                        <p>We, as individual members of the Commission, quite naturally hold
                            divergent views on the implications of population growth and the steps
                            required to cope with it. Yet, we are united in the conclusion that the
                            complex issue of population growth and how we can best accommodate to it
                            will not only remain with us but will gather in intensity on the world
                            scene as time passes. </p>
                        <p>At the present time the number of governmental and private organizations
                            which are actively concerned with population matters is large and still
                            growing. In the United States, these include the Departments of State,
                            Commerce, Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare; the Agency for
                            International Development, and numerous private groups, including
                            academic and professional associations. (Detailed in Appendix B.)</p>
                        <p>The threads of policy and action are in man and diverse hands. A greater
                            sense of pattern is needed.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, we recommend that you establish a permanent, high-level unit
                            to monitor and coordinate all public and private efforts in the United
                            States relating to population changes. This unit might be composed
                            entirely of Government officials, or it could comprise a mixture of
                            public and private individuals. Among its major responsibilities could
                            be the following:</p>
                        <p>1. To advise the President of developments in the population field and
                            recommend means of dealing with them;</p>
                        <p>2. To monitor and coordinate the policies and programs of governmental
                            agencies involved in population matters, setting priorities and working
                            to assure consistency and effectiveness;</p>
                        <p>3. To determine the best means of satisfying a number of vital and
                            currently unmet informational and research needs in the population
                            field, relating especially to the economic and social consequences of
                            population change, family planning services, biomedical research, the
                            status of women in relation to population, population education, and
                            data collection and analysis. (Detailed in Appendix C.)</p>
                        <p>4. To develop impact statements for use by the Executive and Legislative
                            Branches which would examine the likely effects on our population of
                            proposed Government actions in such fields as taxation and public
                            housing;</p>
                        <p>5. To carry on this Commission's work of creating a greater awareness and
                            understanding among the American people of the facts and implications of
                            population growth, both in the United States and throughout the world,
                            and its relationship to the quality of human life;</p>
                        <p>6. To work with interested private organizations to achieve maximum
                            mutual assistance and support.</p>
                        <p>The Commission is convinced that one of the most urgent tasks facing
                            humanity is that of developing a more rational and comprehensive
                            approach to the population problem. We believe that the creation of the
                            proposed permanent, high-level unit is a major and requisite step in
                            that process. We respectfully urge your consideration of this
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>In seeking to carry out its official mandate to create in the United
                            States a greater awareness and understanding of the problem of
                            population growth, the Commission initiated or participated in a number
                            of activities. (Detailed in Appendix D.)</p>
                        <p>Many other activities for furthering the objectives of World Population
                            Year were organized by a wide range of American non-governmental
                            organizations in 1974 and well into 1975. These included a large number
                            of seminars and conferences at which the World Population and the World
                            Food Conferences were assessed and continuing policy needs in these
                            fields were discussed. United Nations Day, October 24, 1974, was
                            declared World Population Day by a coalition of organizations, and
                            programs on population and related issues were developed on a broad
                            scale in many communities. Population questions were the subject of
                            increased media coverage; many organizations devoted particular
                            attention to population and related issues in their regular publications
                            or in special editions. Several universities sponsored conferences and
                            seminars, and the Year lent added stimulus to the development of
                            population education materials.</p>
                        <p>Certain members of the Commission believe that our Government policies
                            and programs relating to the world population problem have been
                            characterized by too much emphasis on curbing population growth, and
                            that not enough attention has been given to economic development and
                            food production. Individual statements by three of these members are
                            attached in Appendix E. In any event, the Commission strongly believes
                            that our assistance to foreign population programs should be seen as
                            only a part -- but an essential part -- of the overall United States
                            undertaking to assist developing countries in their efforts to achieve
                            economic and social progress. </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for US Security and
                            Overseas Interests: <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 200</p>
                        <p>Attached for your consideration is a memorandum for the President
                            recommending he authorize you to issue a <gloss target="#t_NSDM1"
                                >NSDM</gloss> on world population (Tab A).</p>
                        <p>The NSDM is based on an interagency response to NSSM 200 which directed a
                            study by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Under Secretaries
                            Committee of the impact of world population growth on US security and
                            overseas interests The study described in the suggested memorandum to
                            the President was to include possible courses of action for the United
                            States in dealing with population matters abroad (Tab C).</p>
                        <p>The draft NSDM is designed to accomplish several things. First of all, it
                            offers an indication that the President believes US leadership is
                            essential in world population matters. It endorses in general the policy
                            recommendations contained in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IRS1"
                                >Ingersoll</persName>'s Executive Summary. It cautions against
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program efforts that are
                            diffuse. It makes the point that the US objective is to work closely
                            with others rather than to seek to impose our view on others and it
                            places strong emphasis on encouraging leaders of key developing
                            countries to support population assistance programs. It states that the
                            recommendation contained in the Executive Summary dealing with an
                            announcement of a US national population goal is outside the purview of
                            the scope of NSSM 200.</p>
                        <p>The NSSM made certain specific recommendations as to increased funding
                            for population programs, but in our discussion of the subject with
                                <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CEQ1"
                                >CEQ</gloss>, we found differing views on funding. A compromise,
                            with which the Deputy Secretary is comfortable, is an instruction in the
                            NSDM that there should be an examination of population assistance
                            approaches to determine which are most cost effective, and a quick
                            review to examine specific recommendations for funding in the population
                            field for the period after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1976.</p>
                        <p>During preparation of the NSSM 200 response, it was also clear that there
                            is need for a strong interagency coordination effort in designing and
                            implementing population assistance programs. All participants in the
                            study, with the exception of AID, were in favor of the Chairman of the
                            NSC Under Secretaries Committee being assigned this coordinating
                            responsibility. AID's view was that this responsibility should be
                            assigned to the Development Coordination Committee, chaired by the AID
                            Administrator.</p>
                        <p>I concur in the view of the majority. Secretary Ingersoll played an
                            active role in the study and is prepared to perform the coordinating
                            role. In addition, I understand that consideration is being given in
                            State to the appointment of a senior, highly qualified Foreign Service
                            Officer, to assist Secretary Ingersoll in this task. The NSDM is
                            designed to reflect the majority view.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the NSDM calls for an initial report to the President within six
                            months from the date of the NSDM on the implementation of this policy,
                            with annual reports thereafter.</p>
                        <p>There is an ancillary consideration that should be noted. The NSC Staff
                            is currently working with other interested elements of the Executive
                            Offices on a report that has been submitted to the President by the US
                            Commission for the Observance of World Population Year 1975. The key
                            recommendation of that report is that the President appoint a high-level
                            group, either public or private or mixed, to continue to focus attention
                            on population matters. Should the President authorize issuance of the
                            NSDM, the provision of the NSDM setting up an expanded NSC Under
                            Secretaries Committee with concrete responsibilities given its Chairman

                        <p>SUBJECT: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for US Security and
                            Overseas Interests: <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 200</p>
                        <p>NSSM 200 directed a study by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Under Secretaries Committee of the impact of world population growth on
                            US security and overseas interests. The study was to provide possible
                            courses of action for the United States in dealing with population
                            matters abroad (Tab C) .</p>
                        <p>In response to NSSM 200, the Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee
                            has forwarded for your consideration a report on world population that
                            recommends a US global population strategy (Tab B) In a covering
                            memorandum the Chairman highlights the findings and recommendations of
                            the study:</p>
                        <p>FINDINGS </p>
                        <p>--The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> medium population projection
                            forecasts world population growth from 3.9 billion today to 6.4 billion
                            by the year 2000 and over 11 billion by 2050. This is a relatively
                            optimistic projection, and holding growth within these limits will
                            require an international population control effort; Regional imbalances
                            of growth will be severe with the greatest population growth in the poor
                            countries;</p>
                        <p>--Perhaps the most serious challenge from both a humanitarian and a
                            national interest viewpoint would be adequacy of world food supplies for
                            the developing countries as populations press against limits of
                            available land, water, capital and resources inputs;</p>
                        <p>--Excessive population growth holds back economic development and social
                            progress, bringing on frustrations and tensions leading to instability
                            .</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
                        <p>--Support of the UN Population Plan of Action adopted at the Bucharest,
                            Rumania Conference, plus a global target of replacement fertility levels
                            by the year 2000;</p>
                        <p>--Engagement of the developing countries themselves and their political
                            leaders in efforts to moderate population growth;</p>
                        <p>--A bilateral and multilateral assistance strategy giving priority to
                            thirteen key countries which contribute almost half the present
                            population growth;</p>
                        <p>--Delivery of family planning information and services to all and
                            increased funding for <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s population
                            control programs;</p>
                        <p>--Increased funding and support for a worldwide effort for research in
                            human reproduction;</p>
                        <p>--US participation with other donor countries and UN agencies in a
                            cooperative endeavor to develop systems for the delivery of basic health
                            services, including family planning, to poorer countries;</p>
                        <p>--A major worldwide effort of education about population growth and
                            family planning;</p>
                        <p>--Increased provision for food aid, stockpiling for shortages and
                            agricultural assistance (our food policy is being actively addressed
                            separately in the followup to the US-initiated World Food Conference
                            .)</p>
                        <p>The Chairman's summary recognizes that population control policy requires
                            both high level attention and continuing review and updating. It
                            observes that US efforts must be undertaken in such a way as to minimize
                            criticism that they are directed against the interests of the developing
                            countries . Above all, the problem must be recognized by the developing
                            countries themselves . Thus, as the NSSM 200 directive indicated, the
                            objective of the United States is to work closely with others rather
                            than seek to impose our views on them.</p>
                        <p>The USC Chairman recommends that you endorse the proposed global
                            population strategy summarized above. Because this strategy involves
                            complex and difficult questions, including questions relating to
                            political and security interests, and because a number of different
                            agencies of the government have an interest in this matter, the Under
                            Secretaries Committee, with the exception of AID, also recommends that
                            you assign to that Committee responsibility for the monitoring of policy
                            aspects of implementation of the strategy, for conducting an annual
                            review of progress and for recommending to you any significant changes
                            that may be needed. AID recommends that this responsibility be assigned
                            to the Development Coordination Committee, chaired by the AID
                            Administrator.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee's
                            memorandum to you, and the NSSM 200 study, I recommend you authorize
                            issuance of a <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> that:</p>
                        <p>-- confirms that US leadership is essential in world population
                            matters;</p>
                        <p>-- endorses the policy recommendations contained in the Executive Summary
                            of the NSSM 200 response, with the following observations and
                            exceptions:</p>
                        <p>--care must be taken that our AID program efforts are not so diffuse as
                            to have little impact upon those countries contributing the largest
                            growth in population;</p>
                        <p>--there should be an examination of past and present US population
                            control programs to determine those approaches that are the most cost
                            effective in reducing population growth and recommendations should be
                            made as appropriate on revised priorities suggested by the
                            examination;</p>
                        <p>--a review should be undertaken quickly to examine specific
                            recommendations for funding in the population assistance and family
                            planning field for the period after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1976;</p>
                        <p>--in this regard, there should be a detailed analysis of the recommended
                            funding levels in the NSSM 200 study, bearing in mind the desire to
                            advance population control goals;</p>
                        <p>--this analysis should include the appropriate level of funding of
                            multilateral programs;</p>
                        <p>--strong emphasis should be placed on encouraging leaders of key
                            developing countries to support population assistance programs. You
                            underscore that the objective of the US is to work closely with others
                            rather than to seek to impose our views on others, and that in all
                            efforts we recognize the basic dignity of the individual and his or her
                            right to freely choose family goals and family planning
                            alternatives;</p>
                        <p>--the recommendation contained in paragraph 21(c) of the Executive
                            Summary dealing with the announcement of a United States national
                            population goal is outside the purview of the scope of NSSM 200, but the
                            Under Secretaries Committee, in conjunction with all appropriate
                            agencies of the Executive Branch, may wish to make further
                            recommendations to the President on the subject;</p>
                        <p>--implementation of a US worldwide population strategy will involve
                            careful coordination -- the response to NSSM 200 study is a good
                            beginning , but that there is a need for further examination of the mix
                            of US assistance strategy and its most efficient application;</p>
                        <p>--the Chairman, NSC Under Secretaries Committee, is assigned the
                            responsibility to define and develop policy in the population field and
                            to coordinate its implementation beyond the NSSM 200 response, and is to
                            submit to you an initial report within six months from the date of the
                            NSDM on the implementation of this policy, with recommendations for any
                            modification in our strategy, funding programs, and, particularly, the
                            identification of possible deficiencies . There would be a requirement
                            for annual reports thereafter;</p>
                        <p>--the Chairman is authorized to request other appropriate bodies and
                            agencies to assist him in this task as required. For the purpose of
                            implementing this NSDM, the Under Secretaries Committee should include,
                            ex officio, representatives of the following agencies: Council of
                            Environmental Quality; Office of Management and Budget; President's

                        <p>SUBJECT: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for United States
                            Security and Overseas Interests</p>
                        <p>The President has reviewed the interagency response to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 200 and the covering memorandum from
                            the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Under
                            Secretaries Committee He believes that United States leadership is
                            essential to combat population growth, to implement the World Population
                            Plan of Action and to advance United States security and overseas
                            interests. The President endorses the policy recommendations contained
                            in the Executive Summary of the NSSM 200 response, with the following
                            observations and exceptions: </p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Programs</p>
                        <p>Care must be taken that our AID program efforts are not so diffuse as to
                            have little impact upon those countries contributing the largest growth
                            in population, and where reductions in fertility are most needed for
                            economic and social progress.</p>
                        <p>Research and Evaluation </p>
                        <p>An examination should be undertaken of the effectiveness of population
                            control programs in countries at all levels of development, but with
                            emphasis on the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. The examination
                            should include an evaluation of AID program efforts as well as other
                            efforts by national or international groups. The study would attempt to
                            determine the separate effect of the population program, taking account
                            of other economic or social factors which may have also influenced
                            fertility.</p>
                        <p>Research on broader issues should be undertaken examining the factors
                            affecting change (or lack of change) in the birth rate in different
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Funding for Population Programs</p>
                        <p>The President desires that a review be undertaken quickly to examine
                            specific recommendations for funding in the population assistance and
                            family planning field for the period after <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1976. The President wishes a detailed analysis of the
                            recommended funding levels in the NSSM 200 study bearing in mind his
                            desire to advance population goals. This analysis should include
                            performance criteria to assure that any additional funds are utilized in
                            the most effective manner. The appropriate level of funding of
                            multilateral programs which effectively support this objective should be
                            included in this review. The Chairman of the USC is responsible for
                            preparing this analysis which is due 60 days from the date of this
                                <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Role of Other Countries:</p>
                        <p>Emphasis should be given to fostering international cooperation in
                            reducing population growth in pursuing the recommendations of the World
                            Population Plan of Action. It is important to enlist additional
                            contributions from other developed and newly rich countries for
                            bilateral and multilateral programs.</p>
                        <p>Basic Approach to Developing Countires' Population Programs::</p>
                        <p>Leaders of key developing countries should be encouraged to support
                            national and multilateral population assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>The objective of the United States in this field is to work closely with
                            others rather than to seek to impose our views on others. Our efforts
                            should stress the linkage between reduced population growth and the
                            resultant economic and social gains for the poorest nations. In all
                            these efforts, we should recognize the basic dignity of the individual
                            and his or her right to choose freely family goals and family planning
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>National and World Population Goals: </p>
                        <p>The President believes that the recommendation contained in paragraph
                            31(c) of the Executive Summary dealing with the announcement of a United
                            States national goal is outside the scope of NSSM 200. Of course,
                            domestic efforts in this field must continue in order to achieve
                            worldwide recognition that the United States has been successfully
                            practicing the basic recommendations of the World Plan of Action and
                            that the nation's birthrate is below the. replacement level of
                            fertility. In order to obtain the support of the United States citizens
                            for our involvement in international population programs, it is
                            important that they recognize that excessive world population growth can
                            affect domestic problems including economic expansion as well as world
                            instability.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the consideration of World Population Goals in paragraph
                            31(b), it should be understood that the general goal of achieving global
                            replacement levels of fertility by the year 2000 does not imply
                            interference in the national policies of other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretaries Committee, in conjunction with all appropriate
                            agencies of the Executive Branch, may wish to make further
                            recommendations to the President on these subjects.</p>
                        <p>Coordination of United States Global Population Policy:</p>
                        <p>Implementation of a United States worldwide population strategy will
                            involve careful coordination. The response to NSSM 200 is a good
                            beginning, but as noted above, there is need for further examination of
                            the mix of United States assistance strategy and its most efficient
                            application.</p>
                        <p>The President, therefore, assigns to the Chairman, NSC Under Secretaries
                            Committee, the responsibility to define and develop policy in the
                            population field and to coordinate its implementation beyond the NSSM
                            200 response.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman is instructed to submit an initial report within six months
                            from this date on the implementation of this policy, with
                            recommendations for any modifications in our strategy, funding programs,
                            and particularly, the identification of.possible deficiencies.
                            Thereafter the Chairman is instructed to submit reports to the President
                            annually.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman is authorized to request other appropriate bodies and
                            agencies to assist him in this task as required. For the purpose of
                            implementing this NSDM, the Under Secretaries Committee should include,
                            in addition to the addressee members, ex officio representatives of the

                            you afterwards to check in.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary: I hope it is a good ballet.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What is playing? I hope he has a good time. (to Ambassador
                            Green) I have read your paper with interest, but it is not clear to me
                            what you want me to do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: I apologize for that, and for bringing it up on such a
                            lovely day when there are many other problems to deal with. </p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I am delighted to see you always.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: There are a number of groups interested in this subject
                            who look to you for leadership and would like to see you more active.
                            They were pleased when you worked it in to your speech to the Special
                            Session of the General Assembly and there has been widespread favorable
                            response to that speech.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Can we get it into the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss> Speech? </p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary: I just made a note of that.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: This is recognized as a problem in many countries. In
                            Egypt it is a major problem, and the Sadats, particularly Mrs. Sadat,
                            are very active in this area. In two of the African countries you are
                            going to be visiting there has been leadership interest in this subject:
                            in Tanzania, President Nyerere has come out in favor of family planning
                            and President Moboutu has as well. If you could discuss it with them
                            during your trip to Africa it would show your interest and commitment
                            and be supportive of their positions. Certainly in Africa where
                            sensitivities are high the emphasis should be on health aspects,
                            particularly maternal and child health care, but if you were willing to
                            raise it --</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: No, I am willing to raise it, but my problem is that, you
                            know, unless you have something specific to propose it gets lost.
                            General expressions of interest do not do all that much good. But I
                            would be happy to put something specific, but not just as a concern. The
                            great danger we face as the world's richest country is that we cannot
                            look just as if we are trying to hold others down.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: Certainly, that is true, but sensitivity is declining,
                            even in the Roman Catholic Church. In the Philippines the barrio priests
                            are very active in the family planning effort. Some in Africa charge us
                            with genocide, but in Asia there is no sensitivity at all. In places in
                            Africa and Latin America where there is more sensitivity, international
                            organizations and private voluntary organizations can be more out in the
                            front and we can support them. In the past, this has been too
                            exclusively an AID effort, bypassing diplomacy. It is not your or my
                            fault but often we in Washington and our Ambassadors could do more
                            thanwe all now do on this subject. On my recent trip toAsia, I had a
                            very useful meeting with President Marcos, which helped to get the
                            program moving in the villages. In Pakistan I talked to Pirzada, the
                            number two man. Bhutto had destroyed the village structure under the
                            Union Councils making it difficult to get the population program to
                            work, now this is --</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Can you come up with things for me to do, first with our
                            Ambassadors, perhaps a message or something to them from me, and
                            secondly are there occasions when I can say something on this to show my
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: Certainly Ambassadors can do more diplomatically, and a
                            message from you would show them that this is a task they have to take
                            seriously. Some of them tend to step back from this sensitive problem.
                            They probably think I am odd or strange to have taken this job.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: You wanted it though, didn't you?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: Queerly, or perhaps I should say strangely, I did want
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They think that I am queer according to this book.</p>
                        <p> Mr. Veliotes: What book?</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary: Erlichman allegedly said it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Not in Erlichman's book- in this one by Woodward and
                            --</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: I do not think that handling this problem has to cost
                            us a great deal more money but we shouldstep up our present efforts
                            which many groups support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Have you ever gotten any groups here in the Department?
                            Perhaps I could drop in and say something to them. I would be glad
                            to.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: We had a good meeting last year attended by 150
                            different organizations. We plan another meeting this year and it would
                            mean a great deal if you would drop by and show your support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If you do get another group of leaders in I will drop by.
                            And, second, what about the UNCTAD speech? How is the speech coming
                            along?</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary: Well all we need now are the decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: To hell with the decisions, I want to see a draft.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary: I think we have a draft for you. But we still have
                            to achieve a couple of our positions with Treasury --</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Should I work from this text.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Veliotes: Yes sir, the only major issue is buffer stocks.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: Your proposal on population in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGASS1">UNGASS</gloss> speech was very well received.
                            Perhaps forUNCTAD in Nairobi you could stress the health side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I would be happy to, if it fits, and shows some concern on
                            our part and generates some action in the countries we are concerned
                            with.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: To get that kind of action, to get countries to move we
                            need Ambassadorial level discussions on the diplomatic side. AID has
                            been supply-oriented and supplying contraceptives will go only so far if
                            demand has not been stimulated. That demand can be built several ways,
                            notably including pressures from leaders and peer pressures within
                            communities. This approach has been successful in the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> as well as in East Java. It is with
                            regard to strong direction from the top that our Ambassadors can play a
                            role. When I was Ambassador to Indonesia, my first conversation with
                            Suharto was on this subject, for he wanted the U.S. to give Indonesia
                            $500 million to ship the excess population from Java to the outer
                            islands. I told him that if the Queen Mary left Jakarta every day loaded
                            down to the with people, it wouldn't take care of the natural increase
                            of population in Java. This began a useful dialogue on population with
                            Suharto. Other Ambassadors can say similar things when suitable
                            occasions arise and get useful action. Aside from these two approaches
                            leadership and peer pressures - a third approach is the one you
                            presented in your UNGASS speech, namely providing integrated health and
                            family planning services at low cost principally through paramedics or
                            other health workers in the villages, working with midwives or other
                            traditional birth attendants. They can get to a woman when she has her
                            first or second child, not her fourth or fifth, when the demographic
                            damage is done. Most acceptors of family planning services - especially
                            sterilization - have had five or six children. This is not any good at
                            all. Spacing has to start with the first child, as does family
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What about J.D. Rockefeller, can he be of any help in this
                            ?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: He has been active in the past but I understand that
                            his health is not too good and I do not know how much he is able to do.
                            I have been trying to get the Vice President interested in it though. I
                            saw a friend of yours on Capitol Hill and he wanted me to mention to
                            you, when I saw you, his own interest in this matter. I refer to Senator
                            Humphrey who is very interested in this area, particularly what we can
                            do through food-for-work programs under P.L.-480. Food-for-work
                            assistance stresses improving the ability of farmers to produce more
                            food for themselves in <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. This is a
                            more valid approach because it will keep more people on the farms and
                            not flooding in the cities, and helps cope with underemployment and
                            unemployment which are now greater problems than famine. It will put
                            people to work but it will also keep them out of cities where they
                            become disruptive and threats to security for these countries.
                            Food-for-work also ensures that our food aid gets to the rural poor.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Marshall, why don't you do this. Give me a paper as soon
                            as next week that is an integrated proposal with all of your ideas, on
                            how to bring this problem around. I do not mind putting my name on a
                            number of good proposals you might have. I am interested in these ideas
                            of what we can do and putting some of them into the UNCTAD speech. You
                            do not have to come to me ad hoc like this. Get me a paper by the middle
                            of next week that will give me an integrated view of what we can do, in
                            development activities. I have looked at a number of proposals from our
                            posts and it seems to me that most of what can be done has to be done in
                            the countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: That's why the main thing is to get our Ambassadors
                            busy on this thing and to get them working with AID on ideas from the
                            field. We have sent a message out indicating this in response to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>-314; but, if you could sign off on
                            one, that would indicate your interest and get them active.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Sure, send a message out from me telling our Ambassadors I
                            am behind this thing. Send it SECRET so they will be sure to leak it and
                            then the word will really get around. If you send it unclassified then
                            no one will do anything about it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: I am working with a task force of 16 agencies to get
                            together a number of recommendations, but the action is mostly
                            bureaucratic and administrative. The real step is to get our country
                            teams active. Just my getting to see you here today and being able to
                            pass on your support --</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I agree with you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: I do think that the Ambassadors will be more effective
                            when they know of your personal interest and concern. What good is it
                            for them to be rushing around putting out grease fires, while the
                            termites of too many people are eating away at the house.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It was good to see you Marshall. If you have other
                            interests than population it would be good to hear from you, maybe I
                            will call upon you.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Green: I am ready to sailor for you anywhere. </p>

                        <p>Actions Regarding World Population Growth</p>
                        <p>The Problem </p>
                        <p>You requested at our meeting last Saturday that I submit a list of
                            specific actions where you could be helpful in regard to our efforts to
                            curb world population growth. Specific actions are briefly summarized
                            below.</p>
                        <p>Background Analysis</p>
                        <p>-- Attached at Tab 1 is a message to the field which sets forth your
                            concern about world population growth and the attention you expect our
                            Ambassadors to give to the issue, notably in their conversations with
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>-- Your <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> Speech. I have just
                            submitted to the Deputy Secretary suggested language for inclusion in
                            your UNCTAD speech, which relates to primary health services, status of
                            women, and greater emphasis on food-for-work type projects to increase
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> agricultural production, raise
                            rural living standards, provide employment, and reduce urban
                            migration.</p>
                        <p>-- Trips and Visits. As specifically mentioned in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 314, it will be most helpful if the
                            President and you, as appropriate, discuss population issues with
                            interested foreign leaders during their visits to Washington or during
                            your trips abroad. To this end, we will be preparing suggested talking
                            punts for your forthcoming African trip.</p>
                        <p>-- Meeting Non-Governmental Population Groups. Last year the State
                            Department sponsored a meeting on population issues attended by
                            representatives of some 150 non-governmental groups concerned with
                            population-related issues. It would give all these groups a real shot in
                            the arm if occasion could be found this Fall for you to address a
                            similar meeting which could be either under State Department auspices or
                            organized by the World Population Society which is a new organization
                            with high prestige.</p>
                        <p>-- Greater Emphasis on Food-for-Work Projects. This may be covered in
                            your UNCTAD speech and represents one of several moves I believe we can
                            and should take in the area of promoting rural agriculture, community
                            development, and village organization. Among other benefits, such
                            measures will create a better setting for family planning programs.</p>

                        <p>July 29, 1976</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>Subject: First Annual Report on U.S. International Population Policy</p>
                        <p>Responsive to <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>-314, I submit
                            herewith the first annual report on International Population Policy,
                            which has been prepared by the Interagency Task Force on Population
                            Policy. The report was approved by all Members of the Under Secretaries
                            Committee; Treasury submitted a statement of clarification, which is
                            attached to the report.</p>
                        <p>This report develops further the general strategy set forth in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-200 study (approved by NSDM-314). It
                            underscores in particular the NSSM-200 recommendation that the President
                            and the Secretary of State, as well as our Ambassadors and others, treat
                            the subject of population growth as a matter of paramount importance and
                            address it specifically in their regular contacts with leaders of other
                            governments, particularly less developed countries (<gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s).</p>
                        <p>In order to maximize U.S. popular and Congressional understanding and
                            support for our international population programs, we recommend that at
                            a suitable time there be at least a brief public Presidential statement
                            of our international population policy and objectives.</p>
                        <p>In the last analysis, the problem must be resolved by the countries
                            threatened by excessive population growth. Increasingly, these problems
                            are being met through specific measures such as better education and
                            information programs, better outreach of family planning services and
                            supplies, the development of more effective and acceptable means of
                            contraception, changes in laws and policies to support family planning
                            such as delayed marriage, and, most importantly, the improved status of
                            women.</p>
                        <p>However, even in the aggregate, we believe that these approaches are
                            inadequate to cope with the total problem. The report (Section II)
                            therefore emphasizes three additional principal lines of attack that
                            have already proved successful in several countries; and we should find
                            ways to encourage their replication elsewhere: (a) strong direction from
                            national and provincial leaders; (b) emphasis on community participation
                            to root family planning in village life; and (c) integration of health,
                            family planning, and nutrition, including training of competent
                            multi-purpose paramedics to provide fellow villagers with family
                            planning as well as other medical services. As for (c), Secretary
                            Kissinger has already advocated this approach at the United Nations
                            General Assembly Special Session last September and more recently at the
                            Nairobi United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</p>
                        <p>It should be emphasized that the funding levels set forth in Section VI
                            of the attached report are illustrative only.</p>
                        <p>In the next few months as a matter of high priority, the Task Force will
                            be directing special attention to how best to promote and strengthen
                            effective population strategies in the key 13 countries cited in
                            NSSM-200/NSDM-314, including our estimates of projected funding
                            requirements. In addition, the Task Force will examine expected sources
                            and adequacies of food, the relationship between these patterns and
                            population growth, and implications for our population and other
                            assistance programs. Over the longer term, the Task Force will be
                            assisting <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s continuing efforts to
                            develop and improve methods by which performance criteria for our
                            programs in the key 13 and other countries can be utilized in the most
                            effective and directed way.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, there is need for an expanded worldwide effort to cope with the
                            problem. As pointed out in our assessment (Section I), excessive
                            population growth is causing serious environmental deterioration, rising
                            unemployment and underemployment, and a surge of humanity into cities
                            where jobs, housing, sanitation, and other basic facilities are lacking.
                            These overcrowded cities are spawning crime, social unrest, and
                            potential extremism, all with serious strategic implications. Our own
                            national security interests are ultimately affected. As nations
                            increasingly feel the impact of excessive population growth, interest
                            grows, and requests for assistance mount in this field. Any delays in
                            implementing effective population programs will only make the ultimate
                            problem far more serious and intractable. Under these circumstances, we
                            believe there is clear justification for increased funding levels
                            (generally as recommended in NSSM-200) which, together with anticipated
                            increased contributions by recipient nations, other donors, and
                            international organizations and private voluntary groups, will result in
                            a more vigorous, effective attack on the problem.</p>
                        <p>It is specifically recommended that you:</p>
                        <p>(a) Approve the general strategy reflected in this paper, including a
                            Presidential statement (proposed text is attached) at a suitable time,
                            and</p>
                        <p>(b) Approve in principle an expansion of AID's population assistance
                            program. The attached First Annual Report (specifically in Section VI)
                            sets forth general program directions as well as illustrative funding
                            levels.</p>

                            the INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON POPULATION POLICY</p>
                        <p>May 1976</p>
                        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                        <p>NSDM-314 of November 26, 1975, requires that the Chairman of the NSC
                            Under Secretaries Committee submit annual reports, the first to be
                            prepared within six months of the above date, on the implementation of
                            U.S. international population policies as set forth in the Executive
                            Summary of NSSM-200, modified by NSDM-314. The first required annual
                            report is herewith submitted by the Interagency Task Force on Population
                            Policy, established by the Under Secretaries Committee for the purpose
                            of coordinating and implementing the above policy.</p>
                        <p>The first step taken by the Task Force in implementing the new
                            Presidentially approved policies was to ensure that all responsible
                            officials in Washington and the field were informed of the essential
                            content of NSSM-200 and NSDM-314. It would be difficult to overstress
                            the importance of involvement of our leaders, Ambassadors, and Country
                            Teams in overseas population issues. In fact, this may be the most
                            important conclusion of NSSM-200. Our officials must know about the
                            facts of population growth and be fully persuaded of the importance of
                            this issue. They must then find suitable occasion and discreet means to
                            bring the message most persuasively to the attention of LDC leaders
                            whose influence is decisive in shaping national policies and programs.
                            Without this total involvement of our diplomacy, our efforts will fall
                            far short of the mark.</p>
                        <p>To this end, and in order to increase U.S. popular support for
                            involvement in international population programs, we recommend that
                            there be at some suitable time at least a brief public Presidential
                            statement of our international population policy and objectives.</p>
                        <p>This report is divided into six main sections, as follows:</p>
                        <p>I. The world population crisis: Its dimensions and responses by nations
                            most affected.</p>
                        <p>II. Overall U.S. strategy and development of world commitment to
                            population stabilization.</p>
                        <p>III. Maximizing efforts and contributions of other donors and
                            organizations and improved coordination.</p>
                        <p>IV. Improved demographic information and data base.</p>
                        <p>V. Biomedical and social sciences research on broader factors affecting
                            birth rates.</p>
                        <p>VI. Future direction for our AID programs, with projected funding levels
                            for population assistance.</p>
                        <p>Special attention is called to the interrelationship between Sections I,
                            II, and VI. Section I is a worldwide review of the population crisis
                            based on information recently. received from 77 U.S. Embassies in
                            response to a Task Force circular instruction. This Section highlights
                            fully as much as NSSM-200 the serious consequences -- environmental,
                            economic, social, political, and even strategic -- of current population
                            growth in many areas of the world, and yet Embassy responses also serve
                            to underline the rising awareness amongst the LDC's, especially in Asia,
                            of the need for effective counter-measures.</p>
                        <p>Section II underscores the need for our dealing with this worldwide
                            problem as an integral part of our total diplomacy, specifically
                            recommending how best we can direct our influence and support with
                            regard to countries with varying degrees of commitment toward coping
                            with their population problem.</p>
                        <p>Section VI, the major review of AID's population program directed in
                            NSDM-314, recommends how, within that broad framework, our foreign
                            assistance programs can be most effective, with particular emphasis on
                            future directions and funding levels of population assistance.</p>
                        <p>I. The World Population Crisis: Its Dimensions and Resonses by Nations
                            Most Affected*</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the original] *This section of the report is responsive to
                            NSDM-314's request that we take a new hard look at the world population
                            problem. All conclusions in this section are based on a lengthy analysis
                            (summarized at Annex I) of responses the Task Force has just received
                            from 77 U.S. Embassies in less developed countries. In other words, this
                            section objectively reviews the problem as seen through the eyes of our
                            Ambassadors and Country Teams.</p>
                        <p>A. Embassy evaluations of the world population crisis largely
                            substantiate the conclusions of NSSM-200, but with even greater emphasis
                            on the significant impact of population growth on environment and on
                            generating unemployment. Embassy evaluations are somewhat less concerned
                            than NSSM200 with regard to the availability of food to meet population
                            growth in the immediate future. However, our Ambassadors see this as a
                            serious threat in the longer run, with the LDC's increasingly dependent
                            upon food imports, running deeper and deeper into debt and unable to
                            finance the considerable capital cost involved in adequately expanding
                            food production.**</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the orignial]**This conclusion is generally confirmed by a
                            recent <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> report which concludes
                            that, unless there is some check on population growth rates, "there
                            ultimately is no solution to the world food problem."</p>
                        <p>B. A majority of our Embassies in Africa, Asia, and some in Latin America
                            report large pockets of declining agri cultural productivity due to
                            widespread slash-and-burn farming, overgrazing, overcropping, often
                            necessitated by population pressures. The cutting of forests for
                            firewood and to clear ground for cultivation is particularly serious
                            where it undermines soil stability and reduces protection against
                            erosion. The examples of Nepal and Java are most striking in this
                            regard, as is the northward and southward advancement of the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>C. Embassy responses also emphasize the serious implications of rising
                            unemployment/underemployment, with countless millions unable to eke out
                            a living in rural areas, jamming into already overcrowded cities where
                            living conditions for many are appalling. Such conditions can only spawn
                            social unrest with serious political and even potential strategic
                            implications. Embassy responses also underline the fact that migration
                            abroad is no longer the safety valve is once was for relieving
                            population pressures. European countries, in particular, are now more
                            restrictive with regard to accepting migrant workers.</p>
                        <p>D. We were particularly struck by the trouble shaping up in our own Latin
                            American backyard, basically due to some of the highest population
                            growth rates in the world. Embassy Mexico points out that the number of
                            "subsistence-level Mexicans may pose a severe internal security threat;"
                            and that large numbers of illegal immigrant "could cause overwhelming
                            political, economic, and social problems in the United States ..." and
                            that it would be "an understatement to note that our bilateral relations
                            will experience a great strain." A similar danger is brewing in
                            Hispaniola. Embassy Santo Domingo reports serious concern over potential
                            illegal immigration from Haiti and -- should domestic conditions
                            deteriorate -- of the possibility of a Cuban-Haitian intervention in the
                            Dominican Republic. Embassy Port-au-Prince agrees that attempts to
                            emigrate illegally to the Dominican Republic "would lead to stern
                            Dominican counter-measures and the resumption of open hostilities." </p>
                        <p>E. Despite these ominous conclusions, Embassy responses nevertheless
                            point up the fact that more and more countries, including most of the
                            big population countries, have taken counter-measures in the form of
                            national policies and programs to control population growth, though the
                            strength of their commitment and the efficiency of their programs vary
                            widely. We conclude from Embassy responses that, of the 1.8 .billion
                            people living in surveyed LDC's (1) 1.3 billion live in 26 countries.
                            whose governments now have explicit population control programs related
                            to their national economic development plans*; (2) 462 million live in
                            36 countries whose governments accept family planning as a means of
                            improving maternal/child health but do not have government programs to
                            limit population growth; and (3) 91 million live in 15 countries (mostly
                            in Africa) where there are no population programs, and some of the
                            governments are pro-natalist.</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the original] *With the inclusion of China and North
                            Vietnam, 2.1.billion people live in 28 LDC countries with explicit
                            anti-natalist policies.</p>
                        <p>F. Some 15 of the LDC's, according to Embassy reports, have already
                            significantly reduced their birth rates. They include: China, Thailand,
                            Republic of Korea, Colombia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Tunisia,
                            Singapore, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius,
                            and Barbados. Additionally, Indonesia and the Philippines and at least
                            parts of India (e.g., Kerala) have hopeful outlooks in fertility
                            reduction.</p>
                        <p>G. On the other hand, our Embassies note persistent obstacles to
                            acceptance of birth control in the LDC's including all the factors
                            mentioned in NSSM-200 but also underscoring the fact that program
                            implementation is badly handicapped in a number of countries through
                            lack of executive talent (e.g., Egypt, Kenya, Ghana, Haiti, Iran,
                            Malyasia, Nicaragua, Mali, Botswana, Nepal, Ecuador, Liberia) and
                            shortages of professional manpower. Political sensitivities -- rebirth
                            control issues -- also impede vigorous implementation of governments'
                            declared family planning policy in some countries such as Turkey,
                            Morocco and Malaysia.</p>
                        <p>H. The overall conclusion to be drawn from Embassy reports is that
                            current LDC population growth poses serious problems, but this is
                            counter-balanced to some extent by encouraging evidence of greater
                            attention to population policies on the part of most of the LDC's,
                            significantly including the three largest: China, India, and
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>II. Overall U.S. Strategy and Development of World Commitment to
                            Population Stabilization</p>
                        <p>A. U.S. strategy in dealing with the world population problem proceeds
                            from a recognition of the disastrous implications of current population
                            growth rates (including threats to our national security), and yet a
                            counter-balancing recognition that the problem can be significantly
                            eased if the nations of the world take prompt and effective
                            countermeasures. The main task is up to nations handicapped by excessive
                            population growth, which includes almost all the developing world. But
                            these nations need outside help, and it must be our principal task to
                            see that, in cooperation with other donor nations and organizations, we
                            render effective assistance, when requested and desirable.</p>
                        <p>B. Whatever promotes stability, economic development, better health,
                            improved education, and so on, particularly as such measures broaden
                            opportunities for women, will also create a more favorable setting for
                            reducing current excessive population growth rates which in turn should
                            induce countries to become committed to population stabilization. We
                            therefore draw attention not only to the specific recommendations
                            relating to AID programs in Section VI below but also to the need for
                            overall assistance to the developing world along lines of the proposals
                            made by Secretary Kissinger before the Seventh United Nations General
                            Assembly Special Session and his specific suggestions made more recently
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1">UNCTAD</gloss> Conference at
                            Nairobi.</p>
                        <p>C. In the case of countries that have an announced national policy on
                            family planning and development (hereafter termed the "committed
                            countries"), the U.S. should, in addition to its current AID programs,
                            discreetly promote three approaches that are interrelated and have
                            proved highly effective:</p>
                        <p>1. Encourage national leaders to speak out clearly and firmly in support
                            of broad-based population programs, while maintaining discipline down
                            the line to see that population policies are properly administered and
                            implemented, particularly at the village level where most people
                            live;</p>
                        <p>2. Encourage these countries to adopt innovative approaches (which have
                            already proved successful in several countries), designed to root family
                            planning in the villages, relating family planning to the economic
                            interests of the community, and thus creating peer pressures for
                            limiting the size of families;</p>
                        <p>3. Train paramedics, midwives, volunteers, and others to provide general
                            health services, including family planning in villages where these
                            people are known and trusted. This extended personalized family planning
                            advice, to be most effective, must reach women before they become
                            mothers (so first births can be postponed if women so wish) and at least
                            from the moment they have their first child, when spacing of children
                            should be strongly recommended. Sterilization should be offered when the
                            desired family size has been reached.</p>
                        <p>D. We recommend that U.S. officials refrain from public comment on
                            forced-paced measures such as those currently under active consideration
                            in India. The Indian Government's demand for accelerated action is
                            understandable, but there are moral considerations as well as practical
                            obstacles to involuntary sterilization programs (inadequacy of medical,
                            legal, and administrative facilities), and they might have an
                            unfavorable impact on existing voluntary programs. This is not to be
                            confused with a variety of individual and community incentive schemes
                            the Indian authorities have under consideration to promote voluntary
                            sterilization and other forms of contraception.</p>
                        <p>E. In the case of LDC countries uncommitted to population programs, our
                            efforts must be fine-tuned to their particular sensitivities and
                            attitudes. In the main, we should avoid the language of "birth control"
                            in favor of "family planning" or "responsible parenthood," with the
                            emphasis being placed on child spacing in the interests of the health of
                            child and mother and the well-being of the family and community.
                            Introduction and extension of primary health services are, in fact, the
                            principal ways of successfully introducing family planning into many of
                            these countries. We should also find ways, such as through informal
                            personal contacts and special graphic presentations, to show leaders how
                            current growth rates detract from their countries' economic development
                            prospects. This, together with economic and demographic training of
                            promising LDC officials, is particularly important in view of widespread
                            unawareness of the economic facts of life, including wishful thinking
                            that economic development will automatically resolve the population
                            problem. Other recommended steps in dealing with the non-committed
                            countries are to be found in Annex II.</p>
                        <p>F. We should lend even stronger support to worldwide efforts for the
                            improved status of women and for their active participation in community
                            and national life. The advancing status of women in parts of Asia and
                            Latin America has evidently been a major factor in promoting successful
                            family planning and in reducing birth rates.</p>
                        <p>G. In order to increase U.S. population support for involvement in
                            international population programs, it would be helpful at some suitable
                            time and occasion to have at least a brief public Presidential statement
                            of our international population policy and objectives, in the context of
                            our desire to improve conditions of life for mankind for endless
                            generations to come. In all our statements, we should accent the
                            positive, though warning that effective solutions will require the
                            concentrated, sustained efforts of nations and international
                            organizations as well as the cooperative involvement of millions of
                            dedicated people. We should ensure that all countries have the benefit
                            of learning about approaches that have proved successful and might have
                            wider applicability.</p>
                        <p>H. We must nevertheless be selective and low-key in our approaches, lest
                            population programs otherwise be seen as primarily serving U.S.
                            interests rather than those of other countries. That is why it is so
                            important that the LDC's take more of a lead on population issues at
                            international conferences and at home. A great deal of our work must
                            involve personal contacts with men and women of influence in the LDC's
                            and in donor countries, as well as with our Congress, the media, U.S.
                            organizations, and groups of concerned citizens. We must help ensure
                            that international organizations like <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNICEF1"
                                >UNICEF</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_UNFPA1">UNFPA</gloss>, as
                            well as private voluntary organizations, play an active, positive role
                            in support of population programs, although we do not believe that
                            further Bucharest-type meetings on population issues would serve any
                            useful purpose at this time. The focus should now be on effective
                            implementation of the Bucharest Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>I. Over the next year, the Task Force will devote special attention to
                            the five major population countries (Brazil, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey, and
                            Ethiopia) where there is little or no action in the population field; as
                            well as to the other eight countries of the "big 13" listed in NSSM-200
                            (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Mexico,
                            Colombia) which have active population programs, but where in most cases
                            performance can be improved.</p>
                        <p>III. Maximizing Efforts and Contributions of Other Donors and
                            Organizations and Improved Coordination</p>
                        <p>A. At a time when there is growing LDC concern and interest in combatting
                            excessive population growth, it is particularly important that as many
                            financial resources as possible are brought to bear on the problem,
                            including assistance from other donor states as well as international
                            organizations. While U.S. population assistance declined in 1974 and
                            1975 due to reduced appropriations, the contributions of other donor
                            countries rose from $40 million in 1973 to $80 million in 1975 (about
                            1/3 of which was directed through UNFPA and <gloss target="#t_IPPF1"
                                >IPPF</gloss>); and further increases are projected for 1976.
                            However, such key countries as the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden,
                            and Belgium may be leveling off their population assistance. Our ability
                            to play the leadership role stipulated in NSDM-314 and our success in
                            getting other donor nations to do more will necessarily relate to
                            increasing our own population assistance funding.*</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the original]* <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> Member
                            questions this statement on the grounds that, as the major and most
                            experienced donor in the field, the United States could presumably
                            continue to play a leading role even if total funding remained
                            level.</p>
                        <p>B. If the U.S. announces its intention to increase its funding, we will
                            be in a better position to carry out a major effort to get other donors
                            to increase their funding beginning later this year. In addition to the
                            traditional donors, we should also encourage the newly rich,
                            oil-producing states to make contributions to the UNFPA, using the
                            recent Libyan ($1 million) and Algerian ($500,000) contributions as a
                            basis. The most effective channels in this regard are likely to be UNFPA
                            or representatives of countries which have particularly close ties with
                            the oil-producing states.</p>
                        <p>C. There is also need for improved coordination efforts amongst donors,
                            particularly since many donors are now reexamining their overall
                            development assistance programs in the context of population growth and
                            are also giving greater attention to programs which provide improved
                            basic integrated health/ family planning/nutrition services with maximum
                            rural outreach. With regard to coordination within countries, experience
                            indicates that it can best be achieved in the capital of the recipient
                            country through a group consisting of representatives of that country
                            and all donor countries and organizations concerned. Although such
                            formal groups are occasionally unacceptable to the host country for
                            political reasons, some degree of coordination, however informal, is
                            advisable in order that priority needs are met with minimum overlap and
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>D. For international coordination, we recommend a three-tiered mechanism.
                            First, general coordination of the population activities of donor
                            nations could take place in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            Development Assistance Committee (<gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>),
                            with associated international organizations participating. Second,
                            questions of population program funding levels and the impact of general
                            development programs on fertility could be discussed at other meetings
                            such as the "Tidewater" Conferences which are attended by heads of donor
                            aid agencies. Third, senior officials specifically concerned with
                            population assistance could discuss program design, recipient country
                            problems, and other technical questions at periodic meetings which focus
                            on specific issues. Efforts are already beginning in this direction.</p>
                        <p>E. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the
                            private International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) represent the
                            two most important channels for assistance provided through
                            international organizations and private intermediaries. These
                            intermediaries can operate, though sometimes with limited efficiency, in
                            countries where AID's bilateral assistance programs are not now
                            acceptable. In over half of the key 13 NSSM-200 countries, the total
                            U.S. effort is limited to our indirect support for activities of these
                            intermediaries.</p>
                        <p>F. International and regional awareness of the problem of population
                            growth has essentially been achieved; the time for national action is
                            upon us. In response to country requests, the UNFPA is shifting from
                            regional to specific country programs for which 80% of its 1977 budget
                            will be allocated, either directly or through other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies. However, UNFPA has not
                            concommittantly shifted its program content emphasis from "consciousness
                            raising" to the delivery of effective family planning
                            services/information and to efforts to use development policies and
                            programs more generally to affect fertility. We recommend that we use
                            our influence through our UN delegation and in donor and recipient
                            nation capitals to seek such a shift. Moreover, we must continue to
                            press UNFPA to improve the efficiency of its operations.</p>
                        <p>G. In the past, the UN Specialized Agencies (<gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss>'s), e.g., <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNICEF1">UNICEF</gloss>, and
                                <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, have administered most of
                            UNFPA's operational programs using UNFPA funds. The SA's have used only
                            limited amounts of their own resources for population programs and even
                            then only for general and academic purposes rather than country specific
                            and practical ones. As a result, we support the current trend in UNFPA
                            to administer more of its own projects and the related need for
                            increased staff and monitoring capability. We recommend, however, that
                            UNFPA maintain liaison with the SA's to ensure that SA projects support
                            fertility reduction. In addition, we recommend that the U.S. delegations
                            to the various SA's be instructed to support coordination with the UNFPA
                            and to push for consideration of. secondary fertility reduction effects
                            in SA projects.</p>
                        <p>H. Assuming that (1) the trends toward UNFPA-administered
                            country-specific programs continue; (2) program content begins to shift
                            as indicated in paragraph F; and (3) UNFPA program efficiency generally
                            improves, we plan to increase our UNFPA contribution in order to bridge
                            the current UNFPA gap between contributions ($76 million) and promising
                            assistance requests ($105 million). This increase would be additive to
                            the proposed expansion of the U.S. bilateral efforts espoused in Section
                            VI.</p>
                        <p>I. Unlike UNFPA, IPPF and other private population-oriented
                            intermediaries do not require explicit country agreements to operate. As
                            private organizations, they require only acquiescence. As a result, they
                            operate in the eight NSSM-200 big population countries in which the U.S.
                            does not have bilateral population programs, most importantly in those
                            whose governmental commitment to family planning is limited or
                            non-existent, i.e., Brazil, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Turkey. Through local
                            subsidiary organizations, intermediaries like IPPF can act as local
                            family planning advocates using local community leaders, a role no
                            foreign government or international organization can hope to play.
                            Although contributions to private voluntary population-oriented
                            organizations mean less direct control of programs, we recommend, for
                            reasons enumerated above, that AID continue to extend financial support
                            to these groups provided they can program funds roughly according to the
                            directions we outline in Section VI below and provided tey can
                            demonstrate that funds will be used with reasonable efficiency.</p>
                        <p>J. The World Bank Group is the principal international financial
                            institution providing population programs. However, the Bank's policy
                            prevents it from financing consumables such as contraceptives and other
                            family planning commodities. This restricts its ability to finance
                            population projects with its available funds. At present a high-level
                            outside consultant group is evaluating the Bank's population programs.
                            This evaluation and our review of it should help provide a clearer
                            picture of what improvements there might be in the Bank's role and
                            activities in the population field.</p>
                        <p>K. In addition, given the important secondary effects on fertility that
                            general development efforts can have, we recommend that the Bank analyze
                            the population impact of all its new projects, especially those in the
                            newly constituted project area of nutrition.</p>
                        <p>L. As UNFPA has more demands for its assistance than it can fund, and as
                            the World Bank is willing to provide more population assistance if
                            promising requests exist, we recommend that the Bank coordinate with
                            UNFPA to determine if some of these outstanding requests for population
                            assistance can be met. </p>
                        <p>IV. Improved Demographic Information and Data Base*</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the original]* This draws on a special report by the Bureau
                            of the Census.</p>
                        <p>A. U.S. policy in this field should focus on (1) increasing the flow of
                            accurate and timely demographic information and (2) improving the
                            demographic data base in both quantity and quality by:</p>
                        <p>1. Improving LDC capabilities to participate in both shorter and
                            longer-term detailed survey activities which will generate more
                            immediate information about the effectiveness of health, family
                            planning, and related development assistance programs; and</p>
                        <p>2. Improving the capabilities of LDC's to participate in longer-term
                            population census activities.</p>
                        <p>B. Given severely limited AID resources, primary emphasis should be given
                            to the first area because of the urgent need to produce data in
                            connection with on-going and projected studies and to take advantage of
                            the opportunity to include the collection of data as an integral part of
                            such programs. It is clear, however, that U.S. support for the latter,
                            particularly the 1980 census program, should continue through U.S.
                            assistance to activities basic to censuses • such as training, computer
                            software packages, and technical advisory services.</p>
                        <p>C. In the months ahead, activities in this field will be considered in
                            light of available resources, other demands on these resources, and
                            opportunities to relate them to programs of other agencies active in
                            this field, including the United Nations and other international
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>V. Biomedical and Social Sciences Research on Broader Factors Affecting
                            Birth Rates</p>
                        <p>A. The review of current research programs of the various agencies
                            suggests limited change in prospective future actions in the various
                            research areas. However, there is need for better focus and coordination
                            among the two principal Federal agencies concerned: AID, which has been
                            the leader in international population research, particularly as applied
                            to developing countries; and the Center for Population Research in the
                            National Institutes of Health, which has the world's largest research
                            effort in population.</p>
                        <p>B. In coordination with <gloss target="#t_NIH1">NIH</gloss>, AID should
                            moderately expand its biomedical research effort, especially focusing on
                            developing new and promising contraceptive methods (particularly
                            reversible sterilization and injectibles) that will be appropriate to
                            the needs of the LDC's, and exploring the adverse side effects of
                            current contraceptive methods on various population groups among whom
                            peculiar side reactions might be anticipated. NIH, in coordination with
                            AID, should also pursue its biomedical research, which is oriented more
                            to developed countries like the U.S. but frequently with potential
                            worldwide application.</p>
                        <p>C. AID should expand its LDC-based research on cm-. parative
                            effectiveness of family planning systems with particular emphasis on low
                            cost/village-based services using health auxiliaries and laymen, and it
                            should continue to address the desirability and feasibility of
                            integrating health, nutrition, and family planning services in a variety
                            of ways in different circumstances.</p>
                        <p>D. AID should expand its social sciences research on the links between
                            fertility and various aspects of development, particularly female
                            education and employment, health conditions (especially of children),
                            incentives/disincentives to encourage small families, income growth and
                            distribution, and laws and policies which are supportive of family
                            planning. Additional research is also needed on the implications of
                            population growth for development.</p>
                        <p>E. The Center for Population Research in the National Institute of Child
                            Health and various philanthropic agencies of the United States should
                            also continue their work on the development of contraceptive methods.
                            Field-testing of new contraceptive methods in the LDC's should be only
                            on request and with approval of the local government, and should have as
                            its prime objective a benefit for the particular people upon whom it is
                            being tested.</p>
                        <p>F. Finally, the Interagency Committee on Population Research should
                            develop a plan for the improvement of coordination among the various
                            U.S. public and private agencies to ensure maximum productivity from
                            public outlays. Similarly, the U.S. should encourage closer coordination
                            with the research programs of other international donors to provide
                            maximum exchange of information and earlier exploitation of prospective
                            breakthroughs.</p>
                        <p>VI. Future Direction for our AID Programs, with Projected Funding Levels
                            for Po.ulation Assistance</p>
                        <p>A. This Section of the report relates how, within the broad framework of
                            the preceding Sections, our foreign assistance programs can best achieve
                            the most voluntary reduction in fertility with limited funds. We fully
                            support the conclusions of NSSM-200 that far greater efforts, including
                            more U.S. population assistance, will be required to cope adequately
                            with world population growth. The need is compelling (see Section I);
                            the interest and demand are rising (see Section II). Moreover, more
                            attention must be given to the potential indirect impact on fertility of
                            development programs and policies in general.</p>
                        <p>B. This broad-gauge approach could reduce fertility dramatically in the
                            next decades, but the population problem cannot soon be erased. Because
                            of the youthful age structure of the populations of today's developing
                            countries, population growth will persist for some time to come, even if
                            the two-child family should suddenly become the norm.</p>
                        <p>C. In response to NSSM-200 and NSDM-314, AID had undertaken a broad
                            review of efforts (particularly U.S.- assisted efforts) to reduce
                            fertility. Based on this analysis, AID has established program
                            directions for population-related assistance over the next several
                            years.</p>
                        <p>D. Consistent with the findings of NSSM-200 and NSDM314. due priority is
                            given to the 13 big population growth countries (Brazil, Colombia,
                            Mexico, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan,
                            Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand). AID has given major assistance
                            directly or indirectly to Colombia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan,
                            Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand. But India, Brazil, and Mexico do
                            not now desire U.S. bilateral assistance; Colombia has asked AID to
                            phase out; Turkey has taken only limited steps; and Nigeria and Ethiopia
                            have shown little or no interest in their population problems. Each of
                            the 13 countries poses special problems; the courses appropriate to each
                            country are not the same.</p>
                        <p>E. In the past several months, useful high-level meetings on population
                            issues have been held with Asian leaders. As a result, our Embassies
                            report both the Philippines and Pakistan are undertaking additional
                            measures to make contraceptives more widely available to the villages.
                            Other steps are under active consideration to promote family planning
                            measures in Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt. In the countries not desiring
                            bilateral U.S. population assistance, particular attention is paid to
                            specific opportunities to assist through intermediaries (e.g., IPPF or
                            UNFPA) that can operate efficient programs along the directions outlined
                            below.</p>
                        <p>F. Moreover, AID seeks additional opportunities to assist in a limited
                            number of other countries where prospects for demographic impact are
                            bright or where experience applicable to major countries can be gained.
                            Specific country program strategies will be developed and reviewed in
                            the next year in the context of the overall program directions described
                            below.</p>
                        <p>G. Designing programs to reduce fertility must take into consideration
                            individual couples' choices about childbearing and family planning.
                            Couples need not affirmatively decide to have a child. But they must
                            affirmatively decide to practice family planning. Consciously or
                            unconsciously, they weigh the pros and cons of another child against the
                            pros and cons of available means of family planning. Their attitudes
                            toward family planning depend on the type, cost, and accessibility of
                            the services available to them and also on the extent to which they
                            accurately understand those services. Their views on the desirability of
                            a child are most complex, and depend largely on the social, cultural,
                            and economic milieu.</p>
                        <p>H. Providing better family planning services and information is the most
                            obvious way to tip parental decisions in favor of family planning.
                            Better services and information can avert extra births that couples do
                            not affirmatively seek. They can also help reduce insurance births as
                            wider spacing of pregnancies helps to improve the health of existing
                            children. Less obviously, they can indirectly influence the number of
                            children parents seek; for as services change family size, they help
                            modify future family-size norms.</p>
                        <p>I. Thus, most population programs have concentrated on developing and
                            extending better family planning services and information. Over the past
                            decade, AID has devoted some $750 million to population assistance,
                            primarily to improve and extend services and information. While it is
                            difficult to quantify the demographic impact precisely, available
                            evidence indicates that AID assistance has been quite significant,
                            particularly in Asia. Since services are as yet really accessible to
                            only about 15% of most LDC populations, expansion of AID population
                            assistance of this sort should bring about further birth-rate
                            reductions. A principal focus of the program directions is on
                            determining more accurately what assistance measures work best. While
                            the Annex (and other studies available to those interested) summarize
                            available evidence, there is as yet no litmus test to guide us in
                            predicting the most successful program mix in each country setting.
                            Similarly, there are as yet no universally applicable performance
                            criteria, but benchmarks are established for assessing program
                            performance that reflect individual country conditions.</p>
                        <p>J. But family planning services and information alone will not likely
                            bring birth rates down to current LDC target levels, much less to stable
                            population levels which would require an average family of only slightly
                            more than two children. As emphasized at the World Population Conference
                            and elsewhere, many parents apparently want three or more children even
                            when safe, effective, acceptable, and affordable family planning
                            services are readily available. Thus, development policies and programs
                            can be specifically tailored to change the social, cultural, and
                            economic milieu to encourage smaller families, thereby effectively
                            complementing better family planning services and information. The
                            policy options vary widely, but improving the status of women and
                            increasing their basic opportunities is apparently of fundamental
                            importance in lowering fertility. Finally, and most importantly, the
                            types of measures specified in Section II above with regard to
                            leadership direction, community approaches, etc., should help influence
                            decisions for smaller family sizes.</p>
                        <p>K. Program Directions: Consistent with the broad policy emphasis
                            described above, this section sets forth AID's program directions in two
                            parts -- (1) Population Assistance and (2) Other AID and <gloss
                                target="#t_PL4801">P.L. 480</gloss> Assistance.</p>
                        <p>(1) AID Population Assistance</p>
                        <p>L. As in the past, AID population assistance funds will be used primarily
                            for family-planning service delivery; education and publicity programs;
                            training of family planning personnel; directly relevant research;
                            provision of population-related components in broader education, health,
                            nutrition, rural development, and other programs; and exploration of the
                            links between development and fertility. The new emphasis will be
                            reflected in the program mix as indicated below.</p>
                        <p>M. A major AID thrust in family-planning service delivery, as in the
                            broader health area, will be the development of less expensive and more
                            widely dispersed systems of service delivery capable of reaching the
                            large masses of the poor, and particularly of the rural poor. The
                            expensive and usually urban clinics with which family planning programs
                            have typically started cannot reach the rural poor. Thus, AID is
                            vigorously encouraging development and extension of basic, low-cost,
                            village-based services. This will involve both greater use of
                            paramedical and volunteer staff and integration of health, nutrition,
                            and family planning efforts at the lowest sensible level.</p>
                        <p>N. AID's program directions are arrayed in six functional categories of
                            assistance and are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Category I: Demographic Data</p>
                        <p>-- Place less emphasis on relatively less detailed censuses (see Section
                            IV above)..</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand efforts to develop more detailed demographic data to
                            permit better program-impact analysis.</p>
                        <p>Category 2: Population Policy</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand research, particularly LDC-based, on linkages
                            between fertility and various aspects of development, particularly
                            including:</p>
                        <p>a) female education of various types and levels;</p>
                        <p>b) female employment;</p>
                        <p>c) health (especially of children);</p>
                        <p>d) nutritional status of women and children;</p>
                        <p>e) incentives/disincentives to encourage smaller families;</p>
                        <p>f) income growth, distribution, and rural development (especially as to
                            food);</p>
                        <p>g) laws and policy statements supporting family planning.</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand measures to bring out the development implications
                            of population growth and the potential for influencing fertility through
                            develop- ment programs.</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand pilot projects and experiments in areas a)-f) above,
                            providing technical assistance or financial support.</p>
                        <p>Category 3: Research</p>
                        <p>a) Bio-medical Research*</p>
                        <p>[footnote in the original]*Subject to legislative restrictions, e.g., the
                            Helms Amendment which prohibits support for abortion-related assistance
                            other than research.</p>
                        <p> - Moderately expand projects to field-test internationally promising new
                            family planning methods.</p>
                        <p> - Moderately expand research to develop or improve new methods
                            (especially once-monthly methods and reversible sterilization) and
                            international research on side effects of available methods, especially
                            pills, among particular users.</p>
                        <p> - Moderately expand research on the relationship between nutritional
                            status and fertility.</p>
                        <p>b) Operations Research</p>
                        <p>-- Sharply expand LDC-based research on the comparative effectiveness of
                            alternative approaches to family planning services and information,
                            focusing particularly on low-cost, village-based distribution using
                            health auxiliaries, etc.</p>
                        <p>-- Sharply expand research on the extent to which such
                            village-distribution schemes require clinic backup.</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand research on prospects for LDC production of
                            contraceptives and other family planning supplies.</p>
                        <p>Category 4: Family Planning Services</p>
                        <p>-- Encourage provision of a variety of family planning methods,
                            particularly pills, condoms, and sterilization.*</p>
                        <p>[footnote in original] *Subject to legislative restrictions, e.g., the
                            Helms Amendment which prohibits support for abortion-related assistance
                            other than research. -- Encourage provision of appropriate
                            contraceptives through private channels (e.g., midwives) or commercial
                            outlets.</p>
                        <p>-- Sharply increase efforts to help establish and expand village-based
                            distribution of family planning services in rural areas particularly
                            through low cost systems relying on health auxiliaries and laymen,
                            working through local leadership, and promising short startup time.</p>
                        <p>-- Encourage integration of health, nutrition, and family
                            planningservices wherever sensible, taking care to encourage movement on
                            either the health or family planning front where simultaneous movement
                            maybe very difficult.</p>
                        <p>-- Seize opportunities to "piggyback" family planning services on
                            existing delivery systems, particularly clinics, where they are
                            available (e.g., some Latin countries).</p>
                        <p>-- Encourage allocation of health funds to establish broad-based,
                            low-cost delivery systems that could add in family planning where that
                            approach seems most promising (e.g., some African countries).</p>
                        <p>-- Work with intermediaries, public-funded programs, or both,depending on
                            potential effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Category 5: Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)</p>
                        <p>-- Undertake broad family-planning awareness campaigns largely only where
                            general awareness is very limited.</p>
                        <p>-- Where basic awareness exists, fine-tune existing IEC efforts so they
                            are:</p>
                        <p>a) country and culture specific;</p>
                        <p>b) informative on each specific method of family planning;</p>
                        <p>c) related to personal needs and aspirations;</p>
                        <p>d) focused considerably on the interface between village family planning
                            worker and village client;</p>
                        <p>e) reliant on relatively inexpensive media with broad outreach that
                            require little or no reading (e.g., radio).</p>
                        <p>-- Sharply expand operational field testing to better determine which
                            combinations of the many modern and traditional media are most effective
                            and appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Category 6: Manpower and Institutional Development</p>
                        <p>-- Sharply expand efforts to assist LDC-based training of health
                            auxiliaries or laymen for village-based distribution.</p>
                        <p>-- In countries having enough basic family planning workers at present,
                            focus on filling specific institutional and personnel needs.</p>
                        <p>-- Moderately expand efforts to strengthen planning and management
                            capacity at all program levels.</p>
                        <p>O. Funding Levels: To carry out this program, AID estimates population
                            funding levels of over $200 million (including UNFPA) will be needed
                            annually over the next. several years with a possibility for increased
                            levels beyond this, given the enduring quality of the population
                            problem. Obviously, the exact budget level in any given year will need
                            to reflect LDC interest and absorptive capacity, the effectiveness of
                            on-going programs, other donor activities, research breakthroughs, and
                            competing demands on funds. In Table 1 at the end of this Section, rough
                            suggestions for total future population funding indicate the scope of
                            the population problem and the shape an expanding program might take,
                            consistent with the policies described above. These estimates could --
                            and should -- change based on specific country program strategies that
                            will be drawn up as a result of this NSDM review.</p>
                        <p>(2) Other AID and <gloss target="#t_PL4801">P.L. 480</gloss> Programs
                            Relating to Fertility</p>
                        <p>P. In the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1978-79 Foreign Assistance
                            Act legislation recently forwarded to the Congress, the importance of
                            non-population programs as an influence on fertility is recognized. AID
                            will increasingly give this factor weight in developing and implementing
                            its programs, as the following illustrations suggest:</p>
                        <p>1. Rural development.</p>
                        <p>-- Plan, administer, and evaluate coordinated packages of policies and
                            programs (including P.L. 480 Title II, Food-for-Work) designed to foster
                            production, promote employment, lessen urban migration, expand
                            opportunities particularly for women, promote more equitable
                            distribution of goods and services, and encourage smaller families.</p>
                        <p>2. Health.</p>
                        <p> - Reducing fertility is a primary objective since it contributes
                            directly to better health of mothers and children.</p>
                        <p> - Appropriate integration of health, nutrition, and family planning
                            measures is receiving higher priority.</p>
                        <p>3. Nutrition.</p>
                        <p>-- The relationship with fertility is also very close; for example,
                            breastfeeding helps both to improve child nutrition and to postpone
                            pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>4. Education.</p>
                        <p>-- Much greater attention should go to seeing that programs of all sorts
                            reach more girls and women, who are usually a distinct minority among
                            the beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p>While imperfections of both statistical data and methodologies preclude
                            precise estimates of the impact of these approaches, more will be done
                            to clarify the picture in the future. Thus, the Agency will be better
                            able to assure that all measures having a major influence on fertility
                            -- or on health, or on well-being however measured -- can be coordinated
                            more effectively to assure maximum impact. An independent analysis of
                            population-related assistance (Annex III) has been prepared by AID to
                            provide more detailed information. </p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: First Annual Report on U.S. International Population Policy</p>
                        <p>Attached at Tab 1 is a revised version of a memorandum from you to the
                            President seeking his approval for a memorandum for you to send to the
                            Chairman, Under Secretaries Committee (Tab D), accepting the First
                            Annual Report on U.S. International Population Policy and commenting on
                            two aspects of that report.</p>
                        <p>This report was first sent to you by Roger Harrison, before I came on
                            board, on August 9. You made certain changes at that time and a revised
                            version was sent to you on August 30. I understand that this went
                            forward to the President,: but that no action was taken on it between
                            then and the middle of last month. In November, I recalled the dossier
                            to bring it up to date, which I have now done. The principal changes
                            are:</p>
                        <p>-- I have eliminated the proposal for a Presidential statement on U.S.
                            population policy; it is no longer timely;</p>
                        <p>-- I have eliminated references to the budget (<gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>) for international population programs; it has been
                            dealt with in the budget process;</p>
                        <p>-- I have eliminated the requirement of a supplemental report on
                            performance criteria from the NSC Under Secretaries Committee.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Green</persName>, who
                            directs the Interagency Task Force on this subject, concurs in these
                            changes. At the same time, he believes that it would be extremely useful
                            to the ongoing efforts in the international population field to have a
                            record of the President's acceptance of the report as well as the
                            comments which are contained in the proposed memo from you to the
                            Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee. I concur.</p>
                        <p>The report summarizes steps taken toward implementation of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 200 and suggests a change in emphasis
                            from increasing the supply of population control services toward
                            increasing the demand for these services. This provides a useful new
                            dimension to our population control efforts.</p>
                        <p>The report fails, however, to establish performance criteria for
                            effective use of assistance. Treasury (Tab C) has withheld its
                            unreserved approval of the report primarily for this reason. Other
                            members of the Task Force have expressed similar criticisms.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, the proposed memorandum from you to the Chairman of the
                            Under Secretaries Committee directs AID to include such performance
                            criteria in its future population assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>Is it possible to get this to the President for his approval before he
                            goes on Christmas holiday?</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you forward to the President the memorandum at Tab 1. </p>

                        <p>1. THE PRESENT TIGHT WORLDWIDE WHEAT, FEEDGRAIN AND SOYBEAN SITUATION IS
                            LARGELY A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE BAD WEATHER THAT AFFECTED LARGE
                            PARTS OF ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND EASTERN EUROPE IN 1971/72. IN THE <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> TOTAL GRAIN PRODUCTION FELL AN
                            ESTIMATED 20 MILLION TONS, AND LARGE DECLINES OCCURRED ALSO IN THE
                            HARVESTS OF OTHER MAJOR CROPS SUCH AS POTATOES AND OTHER ROOT CROPS. IN
                            THE FAR EAST BAD WEATHER RESULTED IN ONE OF THE LOWEST RICE CROPS IN
                            RECENT HISTORY, PROMPTING GREATER USE OF WHEAT, COARSE GRAINS AND OTHER
                            ALTERNATIVE FOOD AND FEEDSTUFFS. THE SUPPLY OF A MAJOR WORLD SOURCE OF
                            PROTEIN, PERUVIAN FISHMEAL, WAS ALSO SHARPLY REDUCED. THE AUSTRALIAN
                            WHEAT CROP WAS DOWN 55 PERCENT.</p>
                        <p>2. THE RESULTING INCREASED IMPORT REQUIREMENTS CAUSED STOCKS IN EXPORTING
                            COUNTRIES TO BE DRAWN DOWN TO THE LOWEST LEVELS IN MANY YEARS. AS OF
                            JUNE 30 STOCKS WILL BE DOWN ABOUT 50 PERCENT FROM YEAR—AGO LEVELS FOR US
                            WHEAT AND SOYBEANS, 15 PERCENT FOR US FEEDGRAINS, AND ABOUT 25 PERCENT
                            FOR WHEAT FROM OTHER MAJOR EXPORTERS. COMPARED WITH A YEAR AGO, US
                            PRICES OF NO. 2 YELLOW CORN, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED, WHEAT IS
                            TWO—THIRDS UP AND SOYBEANS HAVE TRIPLED. CURRENT PROSPECTS INDICATE THAT
                            EVEN WITH GENERALLY NORMAL CROPS IN 1973 IN MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRIES,
                            WORLD SUPPLY AND DEMAND WILL BE APPROXIMATELY IN BALANCE.</p>
                        <p>3. WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY AT THIS TIME TO MAKE A RELIABLE FORECAST OF
                            WORLD SUPPLY AND DEMAND, AT THIS POINT THE OUTLOOK APPEARS FAVORABLE. IN
                            THE US, WE EXPECT THE LARGEST ONE—YEAR CROP PRODUCTION INCREASE IN
                            HISTORY. DESPITE UNUSUAL WET SPRING WEATHER AND FLOODS IN THE UNITED
                            STATES WHICH DELAYED PREPARATION FOR CORN AND SOYBEANS, PLANTINGS ARE
                            LIKELY TO SET NEW RECORDS. A RECORD WHEAT CROP OF ALMOST 1.8 BILLION
                            BUSHELS IS NEAR CERTAIN. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE, AS NOTED ABOVE, LOW
                            CARRYOVER STOCKS AND SUBSTANTIAL PRICE PRESSURE BECAUSE OF GROWING
                            DEMAND. THE FOREIGN SITUATION IS UNCLEAR. CANADIAN, USSR AND WEST
                            EUROPEAN CROP DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FAVORABLE IN RECENT
                            WEEKS. SPRING CROPS IN INDIA ARE LOWER THAN EARLIER EXPECTED BUT MAY
                            STILL BE RECORD. HOWEVER, AUSTRALIAN WHEAT PLANTINGS ARE SOMEWHAT
                            UNCERTAIN AS YET, AND AMONG THE CRITICAL REMAINING FACTORS ARE 1):
                            SOVIET SPRING—SOWN GRAINS, 2) ASIAN MONSOONS, 3) POSSIBLE UNFORESEEN
                            NEEDS BY THE PEOPLE S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND 4) POSSIBLE CHANGES IN
                            WORLD-WIDE DEMAND, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF RISING INCOME AND ADJUSTMENT
                            IN STOCKS.</p>
                        <p>4. TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURES ON SUPPLIES AND PRICES, THE UNITED STATES HAS
                            UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF MEASURES. US FARM PROGRAMS FOR GRAINS WERE

                            ESTIMATES OF US PRODUCTION FOR THIS YEAR, WILL ALLOW A DETERMINATION TO
                            BE MADE ABOUT THE NEED FOR EXPORT CONTROLS.</p>
                        <p>6. THE US CONTEMPLATES EXPORT CONTROLS WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE, SINCE SUCH
                            CONTROLS ARE A STRONG ACTION THAT CONFLICT WITH OTHER NATIONAL
                            OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING MOVEMENT TOWARD INCREASED LIBERALIZATION OF
                            INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND IMPROVEMENT OF OUR BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS
                            SITUATION. HOWEVER, PRESENT US PRICES FOR GRAINS AND SOYBEANS ARE NOT
                            CONSISTENT WITH THE RETAIL PRICE CEILINGS NOW IN EFFECT FOR SUCH
                            PRODUCTS AS MEAT, POULTRY AND MILK. THIS SITUATION MUST BE REMEDIED,
                            EITHER THROUGH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING SUPPLY/DEMAND SITUATION OR
                            THROUGH ADJUSTMENTS IN PRICE CONTROLS.</p>
                        <p>7. IF CONTROLS BECOME NECESSARY, WE WOULD WANT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO
                            ASSURE THAT FOREIGN USERS ARE GIVEN AN EQUITABLE SHARE OF AVAILABLE
                            SUPPLY. FURTHERMORE, ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS WHICH MIGHT BE IMPOSED WOULD
                            BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE, REFLECTING THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE CURRENT

                        <p>SUBJECT: International Cooperation in Agriculture</p>
                        <p>The President is concerned about the foreign policy repercussions arising
                            from the various problems associated with the international agricultural
                            situation. Agricultural policy has long been a source of irritation in
                            our relations with Europe, and the recent emergency of protein and grain
                            shortages has brought a new dimension to this agricultural problem. The
                            current high prices in world markets for agricultural commodities, and
                            the reductions in PL-480 availabilities are also causing problems for
                            many developing countries and for us in our relations with them.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the upcoming discussions and negotiations with other
                            countries must ensure that future international cooperation in
                            agriculture develops so as to be responsive to the changing nature of
                            the foreign policy, as well as the economic, problems in this area.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, the President has directed that a study be
                            undertaken to review the foreign policy implications of various U.S.
                            international agriculture policies which might be put forward during
                            international discussions of the world agricultural situation and
                            cooperation. Taking into account the evolving supply/demand picture for
                            major agricultural products, the study should include examination
                            of:</p>
                        <p>a. How international cooperation can support U.S. agricultural
                            legislation in increasing agricultural production and assuring farmers
                            that increased production will not unduly depress the prices they
                            receive.</p>
                        <p>b. The foreign policy implications of and likely response to various
                            international commodity arrangements which might serve U.S. interests in
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>c. Ways for improving and sharing the costs of meeting essential food
                            needs of developing countries.</p>
                        <p>d. The negotiability of various forms of international cooperation in
                            agriculture.</p>
                        <p>In conducting this study, the focus should be on ways in which
                            international agricultural policies can affect our overall foreign
                            policy objectives. The roles of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> in
                            international agricultural trade should be considered, as well as the
                            interests of developing nations. Approaches that have been suggested by
                            other countries and international organizations, as well as those
                            currently proposed by the United States, should be considered during the
                            course of the study.</p>
                        <p>This study should not attempt to lay out a detailed blueprint for future
                            international cooperation, but to provide a general survey of the
                            foreign policy implications of various international agricultural
                            policies, of the broad possibilities for future international
                            cooperation, and genera] guidelines for future discussions with other
                            countries in this area. A more detailed study may be required at a later
                            date,</p>
                        <p>The study should be conducted by an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Interagency Ad Hoc Group comprising representatives of the addressees

                            of State. It should be completed and ready for review not later than
                            September 28, 1973.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName> PROPOSED "THAT A
                            WORLD FOOD CONGRESS BE ORGANIZED UNDER UNITED NATIONS AUSPICES IN 1974
                            TO DISCUSS WAYS TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLIES, AND TO HARNESS THE
                            EFFORTS OF ALL NATIONS TO MEET THE HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION RESULTING
                            FROM NATURAL DISASTERS."</p>
                        <p>3. PROCEDURE: ON OCTOBER 9, AT OUR REQUEST, AN ITEM ENTITLED "CONVOCATION
                            OF A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED NATIONS" WAS
                            INSCRIBED ON THE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> AGENDA AND
                            ASSIGNED TO SECOND COMMITTEE (ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL). WE WILL REQUEST
                            SECOND COMMITTEE TO REFER ITEM TO 55TH SESSION OF <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> WHICH WILL MEET IN RESUMED
                            SESSION OCTOBER 15-18. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ECOSOC, CHARGED WITH
                            COORDINATION IN UN SYSTEM, WILL REQUEST THAT FAO CONSULT WITH ITS
                            GENERAL CONFERENCE WHICH WILL CONVENE NOVEMBER 10 AND REPORT TO ECOSOC
                            ITS RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING <gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss> NO
                            LATER THAN END OF NOVEMBER. ECOSOC IN TURN WOULD REPORT ITS VIEWS TO
                            SECOND COMMITTEE. AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE UNGA
                            WOULD PASS A RESOLUTION (TO BE INTRODUCED BY U.S.) CALLING FOR THE
                            HOLDING OF A WFC UNDER UN AUSPICES, AT A GIVEN TIME AND PLACE. THE
                            RESOLUTION WOULD CONTAIN GENERAL TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE CONFERENCE. </p>
                        <p>4. PURPOSE: THE GENERAL PURPOSE WOULD BE TO EXPLORE DESIRABILITY AND
                            FEASIBILITY OF VARIOUS MEASURES OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO COPE
                            WITH WORLD-WIDE PROBLEMS WHICH COULD ARISE FROM POSSIBLE SERIOUS
                            IMBALANCES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR FOOD, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY
                            WIDESPREAD CROP FAILURE, INCREASING PRESSURE ON FOOD SUPPLIES RESULTING
                            FROM POPULATION GROWTH AND RISING INCOMES, AND THE FAILURE OF DEVELOPING
                            COUNTRIES AS A WHOLE TO INCREASE FOOD PRODUCTION RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO
                            IMPROVE OVER-ALL NUTRITIONAL LEVELS. PURPOSE WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SIMILAR
                            EXPLORATION WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO IMPROVE DISASTER
                            RELIEF FOR LOCALIZED EMERGENCIES. WE HOPE THAT THE CONFERENCE CAN
                            EXAMINE SERIOUSLY IDEAS AND INITIATIVES WHICH ARE ALREADY BEING
                            DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS ANY NEW PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE PUT FORWARD.</p>
                        <p>5. WE ARE DEVELOPING SPECIFIC IDEAS CONCERNING THE AGENDA FOR THE
                            CONFERENCE AND PLAN TO CONSULT WITH MAJOR FOOD PRODUCING AND IMPORTING
                            COUNTRIES PRIOR TO OFFERING AN APPROPRIATE DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR UNGA
                            CONSIDERATION. </p>
                        <p>6. AUSPICES: THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARIAT HAS LITTLE EXPERTISE IN THE
                            AREA OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THE FAO, LOCATED IN ROME, HAS THE STAFF
                            AND FACILITIES NECESSARY FOR PREPARING THE CONFERENCE. ON THE OTHER
                            HAND, THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT A MEMBER OF FAO. ACCORDINGLY, THE WFC
                            SHOULD BE HELD UNDER UN AUSPICES, BUT WE WOULD PREFER THAT THE FAO
                            SECRETARIAT PARTICIPATE IN A MAJOR WAY IN PREPARING FOR THE CONFERENCE.
                            THIS WOULD INCLUDE FAO CONFERENCE COMMENTS REFERRED TO IN <gloss
                                target="#t_Para1">PARA</gloss> 3, BUT THE MAJOR FAO INPUT WOULD COME
                            AFTER PASSAGE OF THE UN RESOLUTION SETTING UP THE CONFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>7. LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION: WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONFERENCE WOULD HAVE
                            GREATEST IMPACT IF IT WERE HELD AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL. IT SHOULD BE
                            MADE CLEAR THAT WE CONTEMPLATE CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF
                            MEMBER GOVERNMENTS--NOT AN OPEN MEETING ATTENDED BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
                            SUCH AS THE FIRST AND SECOND WORLD FOOD CONGRESSES.</p>
                        <p>8. TIMING: AT THIS TIME WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON TIMING
                            AND DURATION. CONCRETE PREPARATION OF THE CONFERENCE CANNOT BEGIN,
                            HOWEVER, UNTIL THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ACTS ON OUR PROPOSAL--WHICH MAY BE
                            AS LATE AS MID-DECEMBER. OUR EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT MANY MONTHS MAY
                            BE REQUIRED FOR ADEQUATE PREPARATION.</p>
                        <p>9. LOCATION: NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> WE
                            WISH TO HOLD OUR OPTIONS OPEN AMONG THE FOLLOWING BASIC ALTERNATIVES:
                            (1) UNITED STATES--HOLDING WFC IN U.S. WOULD PERMIT US TO CAPITALIZE IN
                            POLITICAL TERMS ON OUR INITIATIVE, BUT MIGHT UNJUSTIFIABLY HEIGHTEN
                            EXPECTATIONS REGARDING U.S. ACTIONS AND INCREASE POSSIBILITY WE WOULD BE
                            EXPECTED TO MEET BASIC COSTS. (2) ROME--WOULD PERMIT USE OF FAO
                            CONFERENCE FACILITIES AND STAFF AND PROBABLY SAVE ON COSTS, BUT MIGHT BE
                            LESS ATTRACTIVE TO UN AND OTHER SPECIALIZED AGENCIES. (3) ANOTHER
                            SITE--MIGHT BE ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE IF HOST GOVERNMENT OFFERED TO
                            FINANCE BASIC COSTS, BUT U.S. WOULD LOSE SOME CREDIT FOR ITS INITIATIVE.
                            END FYI.</p>
                        <p>10. ADDRESSEES SHOULD REPORT ANY REACTION GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL

                            DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROPOSAL NOW SCHEDULED TO BEGIN NOVEMBER 19.

                        <p>PROBLEM</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY KISSINGER CALLED FOR A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE UNDER U.N.
                            AUSPICES AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ACTS AS SECRETARY OF STATE. THE U.S.
                            OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE THIS CONFERENCE A SUCCESS IN EXPANDING
                            INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON FOOD ISSUES. U.S. LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO
                            STEER THE CONFERENCE AGENDA TOWARD ISSUES WHERE PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE AND
                            AWAY FROM ITEMS WHICH WILL RESULT IN A WASTE OF TIME OR, WORSE, IN
                            CONFRONTATION AMONG COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>THE PROPOSAL FOR HOLDING A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE UNDER U.N. AUSPICES IN
                            1974 WILL BE PUT ON THE FAO CONFERENCE AGENDA FOR DISCUSSION. FAO WILL
                            REPORT TO THE RESUMED SESSION OF THE 55TH <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> ON NOVEMBER 23. THE COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF
                            THE CONFERENCE WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON FURTHER ACTION TAKEN
                            AT ECOSOC AND ULTIMATELY THE 28TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY WHICH HAS PUT THE
                            ITEM ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AGENDA FOR DEBATE.</p>
                        <p>THE U.S. INTERVENTION ON THIS ITEM IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. EVEN THOUGH
                            THE IDEA OF A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE HAS NOW BEEN ENDORSED BY DECISION OF
                            ECOSOC, AND THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME A U.N.
                            SPONSORED CONFERENCE, OTHER NATIONS ARE LOOKING TO THE UNITED STATES TO
                            TAKE THE INITIATIVE IN PROPOSING MORE SPECIFIC TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR
                            THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY <persName
                                corresp="#p_BEL1">BUTZ</persName> WILL INITIATE DISCUSSION OF THIS
                            ITEM IN HIS OPENING SPEECH.</p>
                        <p>THROUGHOUT DISCUSSION OF THIS ITEM, THE U.S. DELEGATION SHOULD KEEP IN
                            MIND THAT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE CAN SERVE TO PREPARE A BROAD POLICY
                            FRAMEWORK FOR DEALING WITH FOOD PROBLEMS. IN PARTICULAR THE WORLD-WIDE
                            CONFERENCE CAN INVOLVE THE U.S.S.R., <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            AND MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHICH MAY NOT BE INVOLVED IN OTHER FORA.
                            HOWEVER, THE <gloss target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss> WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE
                            MOST PROMISING FORUM TO WORK OUT SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS ON AGRICULTURE. IT
                            IS ONLY IN THE MTN THAT WE CAN HOPE TO SECURE IMPROVED MARKET ACCESS FOR
                            OUR EXPORTS, AND IT IS ONLY IN MTN THAT WE CAN BRING THE WEIGHT OF
                            NONAGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATIONS TO BEAR ON AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>UNITED STATES POSITION</p>
                        <p>PURPOSE AND SUBJECT MATTER OF THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE</p>
                        <p>THE DELEGATION SHOULD NOTE THAT IN THE U.S. PROPOSAL TO THE SECRETARY
                            GENERAL OF THE U.N., WE EXPLAINED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE WOULD BE TO DISCUSS WAYS TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLIES
                            IN THE FACE OR RISING DEMAND AND COMBAT HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION
                            RESULTING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS. THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT THE
                            PRECISE AGENDA SHOULD BE WORKED OUT IN PREPARATORY MEETINGS BY
                            INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT EVERY
                            ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO FOCUS THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE'S ATTENTION ON
                            FEW KEY TOPICS WHERE EARLY PROGRESS IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IS
                            POSSIBLE. TENTATIVE U.S. THINKING ON THE COMPOSITION OF AN AGENDA IS SET
                            OUT BELOW.</p>
                        <p>(1) THE FIRST TASK OF THE CONFERENCE WILL BE TO ASSESS THE LONG-TERM
                            DEMAND AND SUPPLY OUTLOOK FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF FOOD. IT WILL BE
                            DESIRABLE TO TAKE A MORE SOPHISTICATED LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDES OF
                            POTENTIAL SURPLUSES OR DEFICITS UNDER "HIGH" AND "LOW" ASSUMPTIONS FOR
                            DEMAND AND SUPPLY THAN HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST. BY DEVELOPING THIS
                            TYPE OF INFORMATION, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN PLAN INTELLIGENTLY
                            FOR SHORT TERM CONTINGENCIES AND ADJUST PRODUCTION POLICIES FOR LONG RUN
                            BALANCE. IT IS THE U.S. BELIEF, BASED ON OUR OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE
                            SITUATION, THAT THE WORLD MUST ANTICIPATE BOTH PERIODS OF SHORTAGES AND
                            PERIODS OF ADEQUATE OR MORE THAN ADEQUATE SUPPLIES. IT IS THE FORMER
                            SITUATION THAT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON.</p>
                        <p>(2) AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AFFECTING BOTH
                            SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS WILL ALSO BE CRUCIAL TO INTELLIGENT
                            INTERNATIONAL ACTION. AS HAS BEEN ABUNDANTLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE GREEN
                            REVOLUTION, IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN LAG SUBSTANTIALLY AS
                            UNFORESEEN CONSTRAINTS ARE ENCOUNTERED. IT WOULD, THEREFORE, BE USEFUL
                            TO REACH A GREATER INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED
                            TO BREAK PRODUCTION BOTTLENECKS AND IMPROVE TECHNIQUES FOR FOOD STORAGE.
                            ON THE DEMAND SIDE, CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF NEW VARIETIES OF HIGHER
                            YIELDING CROPS AND SYNTHETIC FOODS MAY BE A GREATER CONSTRAINT THAN
                            TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTION. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, WE
                            MUST SEEK WAYS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN FOOD
                            PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THOSE WHO
                            HAVE A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE SO THAT DEPENDENCE ON FOOD AID IN THE
                            FUTURE CAN BE LESSENED AND THEY ARE LESS SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF
                            CHANGES IN THE WORLD'S FOOD SUPPLY.</p>
                        <p>(3) IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO PREJUDGE THE ISSUE OF THE SUPPLY/DEMAND
                            BALANCE, SINCE MANY EXISTING LONG-TERM PROJECTIONS INDICATE A TENDENCY
                            TOWARD SURPLUS IN COMMERCIAL MARKETS, RATHER THAN SHORTAGES, FOR MOST
                            CATEGORIES OF FOOD FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THE WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE AGREES ON THE NEED IN ANY CASE TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINGENCY
                            OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES, IT COULD CONSIDER WHAT PRINCIPLES MIGHT ASSURE
                            ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF FOOD, BOTH IN THE
                            SHORT-TERM AND LONG-RUN.</p>
                        <p>THUS, AFTER ASSESSING THE SITUATION, THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE MIGHT
                            ADDRESS: </p>
                        <p>(A) FOOD SECURITY. IF ASSURANCES ON FOOD RESERVES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST
                            TEMPORARY SUPPLY SHORTFALLS IS JUDGED TO BE A CRUCIAL ISSUE, THE WORLD
                            FOOD CONFERENCE MIGHT CONSIDER VARIATIONS OF THE CURRENT FAO PROPOSAL
                            FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF FOOD STOCKS. IT SHOULD DEAL WITH THE MUTUAL
                            RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL COUNTRIES, IMPORTING AND EXPORTING, DEVELOPED
                            AND DEVELOPING, MARKET ECONOMIES AND CENTRALLY PLANNED, IN CONTRIBUTING
                            TO MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE STOCKS. ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE PROVIDED LDCS IN
                            SUCH AREAS AS CONSERVATION AND STORAGE. THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENTLY-HELD
                            COMMERCIAL (PRIVATE) STOCKS AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF FOOD RESERVES SHOULD
                            BE STRESSED. THE OBJECTIVE MIGHT BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SET OF
                            PRINCIPLES ON GRAIN STOCKS. THE U.S. DELEGATION SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT
                            THE U.S. DOES NOT INTEND TO CARRY RESERVES FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
                            AGAIN.</p>
                        <p>IN DISCUSSIONS OF FOOD AID THE MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL COUNTRIES
                            SHOULD BE STRESSED. ALL AID-GIVING COUNTRIES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO FOOD
                            AID AND INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF FOOD AID SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED.
                            GUIDELINES FOR THE RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS OF FOOD AID
                            SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT THE AVAILABILITY
                            OF FOOD AID DOES NOT DISCOURAGE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION IN DEVELOPING
                            COUNTRIES. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED FROM PRACTICES,
                            INCLUDING SUCH INDIRECT MEASURES AS OVERVALUED EXCHANGE RATES, OF
                            KEEPING PRICES LOW TO THEIR FARMERS.</p>
                        <p>(B) IMPROVED DISASTER RELIEF COORDINATION. BETTER INTERNATIONAL
                            COORDINATION OF DISASTER RELIEF IS NEEDED. SUCH COORDINATION SHOULD
                            COVER NOT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE DISASTER PERIOD BUT ALSO RECOVERY FROM THE
                            DISASTER AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, ACTION TO THE PREVENT AVOIDABLE
                            DISASTERS.</p>
                        <p>(C) ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. DISCUSSION AND ACTIONS ON THE
                            WHOLE RANGE OF ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE
                            AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE, ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD TRY
                            TO AVOID THEIR BECOMING ONE OF THE MAJOR CENTERPIECES BECAUSE OF THE
                            DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY OF ISSUES IN THE FIELD. (IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
                            THE CONFERENCE MIGHT ADDRESS POPULATION AS A SEPARATE ISSUE ALTHOUGH WE
                            WOULD PREFER THAT PRINCIPAL DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE BE FOCUSED IN THE
                            WORLD POPULATION CONFERENCE IN AUGUST, 1974.)</p>
                        <p>(4) THE U.S. DELEGATION SHOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT THE U.S. PROPOSAL FOR
                            A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE MULTILATERAL TRADE
                            NEGOTIATIONS NOW JUST BEGINNING. WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY;
                            THE QUESTIONS OF TRADE AND FOOD BALANCES ARE HIGHLY INTERLINKED. THE
                            WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE IS INTENDED TO FOCUS ON PRINCIPLES FOR
                            GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY, INCLUDING STOCKS AND FOOD
                            AID, WHICH APPLY TO ALL COUNTRIES AND TO DEFINE THE MUTUAL
                            RESPONSIBILITIES OF COUNTRIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.
                            DISCUSSIONS IN A U.N. FORUM WILL BE LIMITED TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES, NOT
                            DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS. THE INTENT OF THE
                            MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS IN <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            IS TO REACH AGREEMENT ON SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS BY COUNTRIES ON
                            ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUTURE WORLD TRADING ORDER; THESE MAY OF COURSE
                            INCLUDE MECHANISMS FOR TURNING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES INTO SPECIFIC
                            COMMITMENTS ON SUCH ISSUES AS STOCKPILING AND FOOD AID.</p>
                        <p>MATTERS OF PROCEDURE AND PARTICIPATION</p>
                        <p> (5) THE UNITED STATES BELIEVES THAT THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE WORLD
                            FOOD CONFERENCE WILL BE THE WORK OF AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL PREPARATORY
                            COMMITTEE IN DECIDING WHICH OF THE ABOVE (OR OTHER) BASIC ISSUES ARE
                            MOST IMPORTANT, AND IN DEVELOPING OR SELECTING PROPOSALS FOR PRINCIPLES
                            TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE. THE COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE
                            A SECRETARY GENERAL AND STAFF APPOINTED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
                            UNITED NATIONS.</p>
                        <p>(6) THE U.S. FAVORS THE WIDEST POSSIBLE GOVERNMENTAL PARTICIPATION
                            INCLUDING THE SOVIET UNION AND OTHER NON-FAO MEMBERS SINCE FOOD PROBLEMS
                            ARE WORLD-WIDE AND THE ACTION OF ANY ONE LARGE EXPORTING OR IMPORTING
                            COUNTRY CAN AFFECT THE WORLD. THE MOST PRESSING HUMAN PROBLEM IS THAT OF
                            PERIODS OF FOOD DEFICIENCY IN MANY COUNTRIES SO THAT THE ACTIVE
                            PARTICIPATION OF THESE COUNTRIES IS ALSO CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY
                            FOOD SECURITY SCHEME. THE U.S. BELIEVES THAT THE TIME HAS COME WHERE
                            RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSURANCE THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE FED,
                            LIES WITH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY NOT ONLY A FEW NATIONS.
                            IT BELIEVES THAT OVER RELIANCE ON A FEW PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS MAY HAVE
                            INHIBITED THE WORLD-WIDE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IN NEEDY
                            COUNTRIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCING OF FOOD AID DELIVERY SYSTEMS
                            BY OTHER COUNTRIES OR GROUPS OF COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>(7) THE DELEGATION SHOULD STATE THAT WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAS PROPOSED
                            THAT THIS CONFERENCE BE HELD, THE DECISION OF THE 55TH ECOSOC AND THE
                            PROBABLE ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION BY THE 28TH <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> PLACES THE DECISION ON ALL MAJOR ASPECTS OF THE
                            CONFERENCE ON THE U.N. MEMBERSHIP. THE U.S. IS INTERESTED, THEREFORE, IN
                            THE VIEWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND URGES THEM TO CONSIDER WHAT WAYS THE
                            PROPOSED CONFERENCE CAN BEST SERVE THE BASIC OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED
                            ABOVE.</p>
                        <p>(8) THE DELEGATION SHOULD STATE THAT THE VIEWS OF THE FAO 17TH CONFERENCE
                            WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE AND THAT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE WILL, THEREFORE, HAVE TO
                            PLACE ESPECIALLY HEAVY RELIANCE ON THE FAO ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE DRAWING
                            ON THE PARTICIPATION AND EXPERTISE OF OTHER AGENCIES OF THE U.N. SYSTEM
                            AND U.N. MEMBERS. IT WILL BE IN KEEPING WITH THE INTEREST THEN, BOTH OF
                            THE CONFERENCE MEMBERSHIP AND OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE, THAT THE CONFERENCE GIVE APPROPRIATE RECOGNITION TO THE
                            FAO'S ROLE WITH REGARD TO SUBSTANCE AND TO ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL
                            CONSIDERATIONS.</p>
                        <p>(9) WITH REGARD TO COSTS, THE UNITED STATES EXPECTS THAT PREPARATORY
                            COSTS WOULD BE MET BY AGENCIES INVOLVED, PARTICULARLY THE FAO. COSTS OF
                            HOLDING THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE ITSELF WOULD BE PAID BY THE U.N.</p>
                        <p>(10) SUGGESTED TERMS OF REFERENCE WHICH THE DELEGATION MAY STATE ARE
                            CITED IN THE DISCUSSION SECTION.</p>
                        <p>PROPOSED TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE UNDER U.N.
                            AUSPICES</p>

                            ON THE SUBJECT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE; </p>
                        <p>THAT THE CONFERENCE BE HELD FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES:</p>

                        <p>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE</p>
                        <p>In this study we have attempted to outline:</p>
                        <p>-- The general outlook for the food problem in the years to come;</p>
                        <p>-- The principal issues with which we are likely to be confronted;</p>
                        <p>-- The major objectives of the United States and other countries;</p>
                        <p>-- Various possible approaches, with an assessment of their negotiability
                            and of their compatibility with US foreign and domestic policy
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Outlook</p>
                        <p>Barring some new catastrophe, the next twelve months should see adequate
                            food supplies in the world to meet current commercial requirements, but
                            not to rebuild depleted stocks. Therefore in the coming year there will
                            be a considerable strain on food aid supplies for needy countries. They
                            will be faced with reduced consumption because of high prices and
                            because food aid from abroad (mostly from the United States) that has
                            provided a margin above mere subsistence has been drastically
                            curtailed.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent years we foresee increasing output, in the United States as
                            a result of idle acreage being returned to production, and abroad as a
                            result of the stimulus provided by current high prices. While we cannot
                            predict the long term supply/demand balance, it is not improbable that
                            we will again be faced, at least temporarily, with food surpluses and
                            excess production capacity; nevertheless, we must also be prepared for
                            occasional shortages.</p>
                        <p>Principal Issues</p>
                        <p>The uncertainties of the future evolution of the world food problem raise
                            four major issues:</p>
                        <p>-- How can we meet the concerns of food-importing countries for
                            assurances of food supplies at reasonably stable prices so as to avoid
                            stimulating uneconomic production?</p>
                        <p>-- How can we ensure that essential food aid needs are met in future
                            emergencies?</p>
                        <p>-- How can we ensure full use of our comparative advantage in the
                            production of basic foodstuffs to help sustain the recent improvement in
                            our balance of payments?</p>
                        <p>-- How can we best resolve these issues in a way compatible with</p>
                        <p>(1) Our broad foreign policy objectives: close cooperation with our major
                            allies, development of the LDCs, and improved relations with Communist
                            Countries;</p>
                        <p>(2) Our foreign economic policy objectives of reform of the international
                            trade and monetary system;</p>
                        <p>(3) The general thrust of our domestic agricultural policy toward less
                            government interference and greater reliance on the marketplace?</p>
                        <p>Interests of the United States and Other Countries </p>
                        <p>Different countries look at the problem from different viewpoints. The
                            United States and other agricultural exporting countries (including many
                            developing countries) emphasize a more efficient use of the world's
                            agricultural resources; their main interest is in improving their access
                            to the highly protected commercial markets, notably the European
                            Community and Japan. The importing countries wish to limit their
                            dependence on imports and justify that position in part because of their
                            concern about stability of their agricultural sector and in part because
                            of the desire for greater security of supplies. Countries dependent on
                            food aid are interested in an uninterrupted flow of such aid. The United
                            States, which has borne the main responsibility for stocks and food aid,
                            is interested in sharing the burden with other developed countries and
                            in reducing the need for food aid by promoting sound agricultural
                            development in recipient countries. Most countries subscribe to the
                            principle of providing an acceptable minimum income for farmers, but use
                            different techniques, some of which have serious adverse effects on
                            international trade.</p>
                        <p>A realistic approach to better international cooperation in agriculture
                            must take these various interests into account. A package containing all
                            four major elements -- market access, supply assurances, food aid and
                            farm income maintenance -- should be more negotiable than any single
                            element.</p>
                        <p>Possible Approaches</p>
                        <p>The individual elements of such a package can take different forms which
                            need to be assessed in terms of their effectiveness, negotiability, and
                            compatibility with U.S. foreign and domestic policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>Market Access </p>
                        <p>The U.S. continues to have a vital interest in maintaining and improving
                            access to its major markets of Western Europe and Japan. Increased trade
                            would help to maintain American farm incomes and to limit the costs of
                            our farm programs. It would also improve the balance of payments and
                            contribute to the growth of the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.
                            Expansion of U.S. agricultural exports is necessary to maintain the
                            traditional support of the American farmer for a liberal trade
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>For a good many years the United States has kept some 60 million acres of
                            farm land idle because of the existence of foreign trade barriers. In
                            the wake of the recent upsurge of import demand, 25 million acres were
                            brought back into production in the crop year 1972/73; another 10
                            million acres or more are expected to be added in the current crop year.
                            All acreage restrictions have now been lifted and it is hoped that we
                            can avoid re-imposing such restrictions. However, we must reckon with
                            the possibility that prices will fall to the point where we may again
                            have to restrict acreage if support costs become too burdensome and the
                            Commodity Credit Corporation accumulates excessive stocks.</p>
                        <p>The prospects for international arrangements providing for a gradual
                            reduction of agricultural protection in developed countries are more
                            favorable than might appear from official pronouncements. The Common
                            Agricultural Policy has come under widespread criticism in Europe
                            because of its cost to consumers and taxpayers. At the same time,
                            European agriculture is becoming more efficient and therefore better
                            able to meet international competition. Consumer concern about inflation
                            is growing in Japan and elsewhere. The concern over the current tight
                            supply situation may also contribute to a willingness to enter into
                            serious negotiations.</p>
                        <p>This study outlines several different approaches to improve market
                            access. United States policy makers may continue to prefer the
                            application of the traditional techniques of trade liberalization to
                            agriculture. But they should also be aware that alternative approaches
                            which may be compatible with the temporary retention of existing
                            techniques of support and protection such as quotas and variable levies
                            may turn out to be more negotiable. It might also be useful to consider
                            other approaches such as agreement on self-sufficiency ratios. The use
                            of rubrics which are, at least, partly presentational in their design,
                            such as the concept of "commodity arrangements" which has wide appeal
                            abroad may also help. (Unlike traditional commodity agreements, such
                            commodity arrangements need not contain price provisions.)</p>
                        <p>Farm Income Maintenance</p>
                        <p>As part of whatever approach is followed to obtain improved market
                            access, an international agreement could spell out the measures unlikely
                            to interfere significantly with the functioning of the world market such
                            as adjustment assistance, income deficiency payments, payments for
                            retirement of farmers and farm land, subsidies to mountain farmers,
                            etc</p>
                        <p>Security of Supplies</p>
                        <p>The relative stability of world agricultural markets in the postwar
                            period has been due primarily to the existence of adequate
                            government-held stocks in the United States and in Canada. These stocks
                            have for the time being been depleted.</p>
                        <p>Present U.S. policy is to encourage all-out production and rebuilding of
                            stocks entirely by the private sector: The private trade and farmers who
                            are encouraged to keep commodities in storage with the help of <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> loan programs and storage payments.</p>
                        <p>Can such privately held stocks be counted upon to provide an adequate
                            cushion against major surges in import demand such as occurred in 1966
                            and 67 and again this past year? This appears doubtful. The private
                            trade can hardly be expected to incur the heavy carrying charges
                            (interest and storage) for the stocks required to meet contingency which
                            occurs only once in six years or so. Farmers could, of course, hold the
                            stocks themselves under Government credit and financing programs, but
                            they may want to dispose of their stocks when they feel the price is
                            right and will not necessarily hold them for major shortage
                            situations.</p>
                        <p>Some argue that the matter could be left to other exporting and importing
                            countries. We could encourage these countries to build up their own
                            stocks against a recurrence of major shortages. However, this approach
                            would risk reinforcing existing autarchic tendencies in Europe and cause
                            Japan to intensify its search for alternative sources of supply. It
                            would therefore probably be to the advantage of the United States to
                            participate in an international arrangement to build up and maintain
                            adequate stocks, particularly of wheat.</p>
                        <p>An international food stockpile agreement could take several different
                            forms. It could be designed to cover food aid needs only. This, however,
                            would not meet the concerns regarding security of commercial supplies of
                            our major trading partners.</p>
                        <p>Another issue concerns the degree of international control of world food
                            stocks. It is generally agreed that it is neither necessary nor
                            practical to build up a centrally managed "world food bank". The present
                            thinking in the United States and elsewhere leans toward national
                            stockpiles which would be subject to international rules and procedures
                            concerning the size of stocks to be held by individual participants, and
                            the timing of their replenishment and release. Stock levels and/or
                            prices could be used to trigger action or as presumptive criteria which
                            would be taken into account in international consultations. An agreement
                            of this kind could help to provide (1) security of supplies at
                            reasonably stable prices and (2) an equitable sharing of the financial
                            burden among both food exporting and importing developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Complementing a world food security scheme, the United States could
                            propose to negotiate a code of conduct containing rules and procedures
                            concerning the imposition, administration, and phasing-out of temporary
                            export restrictions as well as import restrictions. This would serve the
                            dual purpose of greater security of supplies and greater security of
                            access to markets.</p>
                        <p>For maximum effectiveness, any such arrangement should be part of our
                            strategy in the multilateral trade negotiations and should be linked
                            with US objectives concerning improved market access and the phasing-out
                            of subsidies</p>
                        <p>Food AID.</p>
                        <p>Now that food surpluses are no longer assured, production for food aid
                            must be deliberately planned. What priority should be attached to food
                            aid as distinct from other forms of aid?</p>
                        <p>From the United States point of view, there are several advantages in
                            supplying aid in the form of food so long as the United States has
                            efficient agricultural production capacity which would otherwise be idle
                            because of foreign trade barriers. This is not true to the same extent
                            when we supply aid in the form of industrial products. Furthermore,
                            there are budgetary advantages whenever market prices are below target
                            prices, in that the Government saves on deficiency payments to the
                            extent that PL 48O purchases help to raise the market prices. Finally,
                            it is generally easier to obtain Congressional support for food aid than
                            for other aid programs.</p>
                        <p>So far as food aid receiving countries are concerned, it has beep argued
                            that supply aid in the form of food may discourage domestic agricultural
                            production. Aid according to this view should mostly take the form of
                            technical assistance in support of agricultural development. Others
                            point out that agricultural development is a slow process and that food
                            aid will be needed for some time to come, not only to meet short-term
                            emergency situations but also to mitigate widespread chronic
                            malnutrition which is a major depressant of human productivity in many
                            developing countries. Food aid policy should be re-examined, however, to
                            see whether there are possible adverse effects (discouragement of
                            agricultural production in developing countries and displacement of
                            commercial trade) and if so, whether these can be minimized by ensuring,
                            so far as possible, that food supplied on concessional terms leads to
                            additional consumption.</p>
                        <p>Assuming food aid programs will continue, how can we assure that food is
                            available when it is needed? An international stockpiling scheme as
                            outlined above would go a long way to ensure that in times of shortage,
                            those with the least ability to pay will not be the first to suffer.
                            Additional security could be provided for food aid receiving countries
                            by:</p>
                        <p>-- Providing food aid for stock building;</p>
                        <p>-- Providing additional financing of storage costs;</p>
                        <p>-- Or alternatively by building up separate food aid stocks in donor
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Here again, it would seem to be in the United States interest to operate
                            its bilateral programs in the broad framework of an international
                            arrangement that would share the burden among both food exporting and
                            food importing developed countries. International guidelines could be
                            developed which would establish the principles and operating procedures
                            for food aid under bilateral and existing (and if possible expanded)
                            multilateral programs. A list of recipient countries could be
                            established, some of which would be eligible for food aid all of the
                            time, and others eligible depending on the degree of tightness in world
                            markets. In the United States, improved coordinating machinery may be
                            needed to ensure effective allocation of food aid in accordance with
                            U.S. international commitments and specific U.S. political, economic and
                            humanitarian objectives in particular receiving countries.</p>
                        <p>Institutional Framework </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> is holding its biennial
                            conference in November 1973. International agricultural adjustment and
                            the Director General's proposal for a stockpile agreement are on the
                            agenda. The U.S. could use this forum to outline the world food problem
                            as we see it and to give some general indications of what we think needs
                            to be done. We could also use the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            as a forum for consultations with other major trading nations.</p>
                        <p>In the World Food Conference which the U.S. has proposed for 1974, the
                            U.S. could spell out its thinking in greater detail. The Conference
                            could serve to establish a broad policy framework for dealing with the
                            world's agricultural and food problems.</p>
                        <p>The multilateral trade negotiations are likely to be the most promising
                            forum for actual negotiations to tie all these elements together. It is
                            only in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> that we can bring the
                            weight of non-agricultural negotiations to bear on agricultural trade
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Where appropriate, issues of concern to the <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD1"
                                >UNCTAD</gloss> and the FA0 could be brought to these organizations
                            for discussion and formal approval.</p>
                        <p>Further Study</p>
                        <p>There is a need for further review of U.S. policy in all of the areas
                            covered in this study. Work is already in progress on the formulation of
                            the U.S. position for the multilateral trade negotiations. We recommend
                            that further studies be undertaken to examine in greater detail what
                            alternatives are available to the U.S. in the fields of stockpiling and
                            food aid, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We need to
                            examine possible incompatibilities between our domestic agricultural
                            objectives and foreign policy objectives to see what changes need to be
                            made. We should try to ensure, so far as possible, that our food
                            policies are compatible with our broad foreign policy objectives and
                            that they reinforce and do not conflict with each other.</p>

                            TRANSMITTED TO <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> FOR ITS
                            DISCUSSIONS ON THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE BEGINNING NEXT WEEK. THIS CAME
                            ONLY AFTER A BATTLE BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE
                            ISSUES OF THE EXTENT OF COMMITMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO AT A WORLD FOOD
                            CONFERENCE (<gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss>) AND WHETHER THE WFC
                            SHOULD EXTEND TO THE AREA OF TRADE. THE REPORT, WHICH ALL PARTIES AGREED
                            SHOULD BE JOINTLY AGREED AND WITHOUT RESERVATION BY ANY DELEGATION IN
                            ORDER TO EMPHASIZE THE UNITED POSITION OF FAO MEMBERS THAT THE
                            ORGANIZATION SHOULD PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE WFC, WAS A COMPROMISE AND
                            NOT WHOLLY SATISFACTORY TO ANY DELEGATION. AN EPISODE THURSDAY EVENING,
                            WHEN <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S DISPUTED AN "OBSERVATION" BY
                            THE FRENCH DELEGATION ON THE AGREED TEXT WHICH STATED THAT "A CERTAIN
                            NUMBER OF COUNTRIES" (READ DEVELOPED, AND INCLUDING THE U.S.) CONSIDERED
                            THAT TRADE SHOULD NOT BE THE CENTERPIECE OF THE CONFERENCE, WAS
                            ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE DIVISION BETWEEN LDC'S AND DC'S. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. THE FAO CONFERENCE AGREED NOVEMBER 23 ON A REPORT TO ECOSOC ON WORLD
                            FOOD CONFERENCE FOR USE BY ECOSOC IN ITS DISCUSSIONS BEGINNING NOVEMBER
                            26 ON THE SUBJECT (TEXT SENT <gloss target="#t_SEPTEL1">SEPTEL</gloss>).
                            THIS TEXT WAS THE SUBJECT OF NUMEROUS COMPROMISES, SINCE ALL PARTIES,
                            AND IN PARTICULAR THE FAO SECRETARIAT, WISHED TO AVOID A DOCUMENT WHICH
                            WOULD LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE FAO WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH ONE
                            VOICE AND THUS UNQUALIFIED TO PLAY THE MAJOR ROLE IN THE WFC. THUS, THE
                            USUAL FAO FORMULA OF "SOME NATIONS FELT THAT" SUCH-AND-SUCH, "WHILE
                            OTHERS FELT "SO-AND-SO WAS REJECTED BY ALL BUT THE FRENCH DELEGATION,
                            WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY PERSUADED BY OTHERS TO AGREE.</p>
                        <p>3. THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES PROVOKED BY THE DRAFT WERE THOSE OF THE EXTENT OF
                            COMMITMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO AT THE WFC, AND WHAT SUBJECT MATTER THE
                            WFC SHOULD COVER. ON FIRST POINT, AND AFTER MUCH DEBATE ON FLOOR (SEE
                                <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss> B) AND IN THE DRAFTING
                            COMMITTEE, THE FOLLOWING COMPROMISE SENTENCE WAS AGREED: "THE PRINCIPAL
                            TASK OF THE WFC, ON WHICH MOST OF ITS EFFORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSED, SHOULD
                            BE TO BRING ABOUT A COMMITMENT BY THE WORLD COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE TO
                            UNDERTAKE CONCRETE ACTION TOWARDS RESOLVING THE WORLD FOOD PROBLEM
                            WITHIN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS." THIS WORDING
                            SATISFIED THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH WERE SEEKING A "COMMITMENT",
                            WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME SUGGESTING ANY BINDING NATIONAL COMMITMENTS. </p>
                        <p>4. THE SECOND ISSUE WAS THAT OF THE ROLE OF TRADE IN THE WFC. HERE, THE
                            TEXT OF THE REPORT NOTES THAT "WHILE THE WFC WAS NOT ENVISAGED AS A
                            NEGOTIATING FORUM, IT SHOULD NEVERTHELESS AIM AT REACHING AGREEMENT ON
                            SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND PROGRAMS, WHICH WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY BE CARRIES
                            OUT THROUGH EXISTING MACHINERY. THIS ROLE WAS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT
                            IN THE AREA OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
                            ADJUSTMENT, SINCE QUESTIONS OF TRADE AND FOOD BALANCES WERE HIGHLY
                            INTERLINKED." THE LATTER PART OF SECOND SENTENCE COMES DIRECTLY FROM
                            TEXT OF SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">BUTZ</persName>' STATEMENT
                            TO FAO CONFERENCE ON NOVEMBER 13.</p>
                        <p>5. A MAJOR STORM DEVELOPED WHEN THE REPORT AS PREPARED BY DRAFTING
                            COMMITTEE WAS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR OF COMMISSION IM ALTHOUGH NO
                            DELEGATION WAS ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE REPORT, IT WAS AGREED BY
                            VIRTUALLY ALL DELEGATIONS THAT NO AMENDMENTS OR RESERVATIONS WOULD BE
                            PRESENTED ON THE FLOOR. FRENCH DELEGATION, HOWEVER, CONDITIONED THEIR
                            APPROVAL ON A CLARIFYING "OBSERVATION" ON TRADE FOR WHICH THEY OBTAINED
                            APPROVAL FROM ALL OTHER <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> DELEGATIONS,
                            AND WHICH JAPAN, CANADA, US, SWEDEN, FINLAND AND NORWAY ALSO SUPPORTED.
                            TEXT OF "OBSERVATION" WAS AS FOLLOWS: "THE FRENCH DELEGATION IS
                            AUTHORIZED BY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STATES TO PRESENT THE FOLLOWING
                            OBSERVATION: THESE STATES CONSIDER THAT THE WFC SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON
                            FOOD PROBLEMS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
                            AND FOOD AID, WITHOUT GIVING TO TRADE QUESTIONS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO
                            THEM AND WHICH ARE FURTHERMORE DEALT WITH IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, A
                            PLACE WHICH DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE FUNDAMENTAL ACTIVITY OF SAID
                            CONFERENCE." THIS "OBSERVATION", PRESENTED AFTER THE COMMITTEE HAD
                            APPROVED THE TEXT OF THE REPORT, BROUGHT FORTH ANGRY REJOINDERS FROM
                            MANY LDC'S, WHO SAID THAT IT REPRESENTED IN EFFECT A RESERVATION BY THE
                            FIFTEEN STATES ON THE TEXT JUST AGREED. DC'S COUNTERED THAT IT WAS NOT A
                            RESERVATION, BUT MERELY A REMINDER OF THE POSITION ALREADY TAKEN IN
                            COMMISSION I AND STATEMENTS BY AGRICULTURE MINISTERS DURING EARLIER
                            DISCUSSIONS. AT THAT POINT, TENUOUS AGREEMENT ON TEXT SEEMED LIKELY TO
                            BREAK DOWN. </p>
                        <p>6. USDEL CONCLUDED THAT FRENCH MUST BE PERSUADED TO WITHDRAW
                            "OBSERVATION" OR FIND ANOTHER SATISFACTORY COMPROMISE FORMULA TO MOLLIFY
                            LDC'S. ACCORDINGLY ON NOVEMBER 23 US REQUESTED CAUCUS OF 15 COUNTRIES
                            JOINING IN OBSERVATION. AT MEETING CHAIRED BY US, FRENCH INFORMED GROUP
                            THEY NOT PREPARED TO WITHDRAW "OBSERVATION." THEY HAD BEEN IN CONTACT
                            WITH SECRETARIAT, HOWEVER, AND HAD AGREED TO MAKE CONCILIATORY STATEMENT
                            IN PLENARY (1) EMPHASIZING THAT THEY AGREED TO REPORT AND HAD NO
                            RESERVATIONS AND (2) IN ORDER THAT THERE BE NO DOUBT THEY WOULD PROPOSE
                            THAT VERBATIM RECORDS WHICH COMMISSION I HAD DECIDED TO SEND TO NEW YORK
                            TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO SUBSTANTIVE DEBATES OF
                            NOVEMBER 19 AND 20. FRENCH INDICATED KEY NON-ALIGNED LEADERS HAD AGREED
                            TO THIS FACE-SAVING FORMULA. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY NOTE FROM <gloss
                                target="#t_DG1">DG</gloss>'S OFFICE INFORMING CHAIRMAN THAT KEY LDC
                            DELS HAD AGREED TO FORMULA AND THERE MIGHT BE NO NEED TO HOLD MEETING
                            WHICH HE HAD SCHEDULED WITH 15 COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>7. GROUP AGREED THAT FRENCH WOULD SPEAK FOR ALL 15 DELS, BUT OTHER
                            COUNTRIES COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED (THIS DUE TO DUTCH RELUCTANCE TO BE
                            IDENTIFIED AGAIN WITH ORIGINAL RESOLUTION), AND THAT US WOULD FOLLOW
                            WITH CONCILIATORY GENERAL STATEMENT. GROUP ASKED THAT US CHAIRMAN INFORM
                            DG OF DECISION AND KEEP GROUP POSTED ON ANY LATE DEVELOPMENTS. MEETING
                            WITH DG CONFIRMED THAT SECRETARIAT HAD SALVAGE OPERATION WELL IN HAND,
                            INCLUDING PREPARED STATEMENTS FOR PLENARY AND COMMISSION I CHAIRMEN TO
                            FACILITATE ADOPTION OF REPORT. </p>
                        <p>8. PLENARY SESSION TOOK PLACE WITHOUT A HITCH. AFTER STATEMENTS BY FRANCE
                            AND US, COLOMBIA DEL (BULA HOYOS, PERMANENT CHAIRMAN ELECT OF FAO
                            COUNCIL), MADE STATEMENT ACCEPTING FRENCH STATEMENT IN GOOD GRACE,
                            INDICATING HE WOULD REGRET PREVIOUS DAY'S EXPERIENCE BEING REPEATED IN
                            NEW YORK, AND URGING GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHAT THEY COULD TO AVOID THIS.
                            REPORT THEN ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY.</p>
                        <p> 9. DG BOERMA EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION THAT REPORT, WHICH WOULD GIVE
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> CLEAR GUIDANCE, WAS UNANIMOUSLY
                            ADOPTED. HE SAID WFC IS A GREAT CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY, PROVIDED IT
                            EXPRESSES POLITICAL WILL OF GOVERNMENTS TO PUT AN END TO HUNGER AND
                            MALNUTRITION. WFC WILL HAVE HUMANITARIAN, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
                            ASPECTS - THAT WAS REASON FOR DIFFICULTY IN ARRIVING AT A COMPROMISE.
                            ALTHOUGH DISCUSSION IN NEW YORK WOULD BE COMPLICATED, HE EXPRESSED HOPE
                            THAT SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE WOULD PREVAIL THERE ALSO, AND SAID HE WAS
                            CONFIDENT THAT THE NECESSARY POLITICAL WILL EXISTS IN THE WORLD TO MAKE
                            THE WFC A SUCCESS.</p>
                        <p>COMMENT: FAO MEETING ON WFC CLEARLY CONFIRMS THAT THE LDC'S VIEW THE
                            CONFERENCE AS ONE DEDICATED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS AND
                            ONE IN WHICH THE CENTRAL FOCUS MUST BE TRADE, WITH THE COMMITMENTS TO BE
                            OBTAINED AT THE CONFERENCE AS BINDING AS POSSIBLE. IT ALSO SHOWS THE
                            SENSITIVITY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON THE TRADE ISSUE AND THEIR DESIRE
                            TO AVOID ANY ACTIONS AT THE WFC WHICH MIGHT PREJUDICE THE <gloss
                                target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss>. WE CAN EXPECT BOTH OF THESE ISSUES TO
                            CONTINUE TO BE CONTENTIOUS AS PREPARATIONS FOR THE WFC DEVELOP FURTHER.
                            OUR DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE DEVELOPED GROUP ALSO SHOWED THAT JAPAN, AND
                            IN PARTICULAR FRANCE, ARE RELUCTANT TO SEE THE FAO'S PROPOSALS FOR
                            AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT TAKEN UP AT THE WFC. FINALLY, THE DELEGATION OF
                            THE <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> WAS ALMOST TOTALLY SILENT
                            (EXCEPT FOR THEIR STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR THE ALGIERS DECLARATION), BUT
                            PRESUMABLY THEIR LACK OF OBJECTION TO PASSAGE OF THE REPORT INDICATES
                            PRC WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WFC. VOLPE </p>

                        <p>1. PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS TO BRING US MISSIONS UP TO
                            DATE ON STATUS OF PREPARATIONS FOR WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE, ON CURRENT
                            STATE OF OUR THINKING ON PURPOSES AND SCOPE OF CONFERENCE AND TO
                            ENCOURAGE POSTS TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS AND
                            INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE THEY BELIEVE LIKELY TO
                            PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CONFERENCE AND IN PREPARATIONS FOR CONFERENCE. IT
                            SHOULD BE STRESSED THAT OUR VIEWS AT THIS STAGE ARE STILL PRELIMINARY
                            AND THAT WE WILL NOT FIRM THEM UP UNTIL WE HAVE HAD FULLER EXCHANGE OF
                            VIEWS IN AND OUT OF <gloss target="#t_PREPCOM1">PREPCOM</gloss> WITH
                            OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.</p>
                        <p>2. CONFERENCE ORGANIZATION. ON DECEMBER 17, 1973, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
                            APPROVED CONVENING A WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE (<gloss target="#t_WFC1">
                                WFC</gloss>) UNDER UN AUSPICES FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS IN NOVEMBER 1974
                            AT ROME. FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF FAO AND THE
                            SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNCTAD, UN SECRETARY GENERAL <persName
                                corresp="#p_WK5">WALDHEIM</persName> IS EXPECTED TO APPOINT SAYED
                            AHMED <persName corresp="#p_MSA1">MAREI</persName> OF EGYPT AS DIRECTOR
                            GENERAL OF THE WFC. MAREI WILL HEAD A SMALL CONFERENCE SECRETARIAT DRAWN
                            PARTICULARLY FROM FAO, UNCTAD, AND OTHER RELEVANT BODIES OF THE UN
                            SYSTEM. MAREI (CURRENTLY AN ADVISER TO PRESIDENT SADAT) IS A FORMER
                            MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE OF EGYPT WHO IS WELL KNOWN IN INTERNATIONAL
                            AGRICULTURAL CIRCLES.</p>
                        <p>3. PREPARATORY COMMITTEE. THE <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>,
                            WHICH IS ENTRUSTED WITH OVER-ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONFERENCE, IS
                            NOW ESTABLISHING AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL PREPARATORY COMMITTEE (PREPCOM)
                            OPEN TO ALL UN MEMBERS WHICH BY JANUARY 18 HAVE REGISTERED THEIR
                            INTENTION TO BE INCLUDED. THE PREPCOM WILL MEET FEBRUARY 11-15 IN NEW
                            YORK TO BEGIN INITIAL PREPARATIONS FOR CONFERENCE. PRELIMINARY
                            INDICATIONS ARE THAT SECOND MEETING OF THE PREPCOM WILL BE HELD AT
                            MID-YEAR AT GENEVA AND THAT THIRD MEETING WILL BE HELD IN ROME JUST
                            BEFORE CONVENING OF WFC IN NOVEMBER.</p>
                        <p>4. THEME OF CONFERENCE. WE SEE THEME OF CONFERENCE AS EXPLORING WAYS IN
                            WHICH WORLD COMMUNITY CAN ACT TO IMPROVE FOOD PRODUCTION AND
                            DISTRIBUTION AND LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTION OF RESERVES TO ENABLE MORE
                            PEOPLE TO EAT MINIMUM NECESSARY FOR GOOD HEALTH, YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.
                            WHILE THIS FOCUS PUTS PRINCIPAL EMPHASIS OF WFC ON NEEDS OF <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'S, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT DC'S ALSO
                            FACE POSSIBLE FOOD SHORTAGES OR EMERGENCIES. FOOD PROBLEM IS TRULY
                            GLOBAL.</p>
                        <p>5. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CONFERENCES. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT WE BELIEVE IT
                            ESSENTIAL TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS WORLD FOOD REPEAT FOOD CONFERENCE
                            AND NOT REPEAT NOT ONE ON WORLD AGRICULTURAL OR WORLD DEVELOPMENT OR
                            WORLD TRADE THOUGH ASPECTS OF THOSE SUBJECTS OVERLAP OUR CONCERN OVER
                            FOOD SITUATION.</p>
                        <p>6. BECAUSE PREPARATION TIME FOR CONFERENCE IS LIMITED (ONE FOURTH OF TIME
                            ALLOWED FOR ENVIRONMENT AND POPULATION CONFERENCES) AND BECAUSE NO WORLD
                            CONFERENCE CAN DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH MANY SUBJECTS IN ANY DEGREE OF
                            DETAIL IN TWO-WEEK MEETING, CONFERENCE CAN ONLY DEAL WITH FEW KEY
                            ASPECTS OF THIS FOOD PROBLEM. IT CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DUPLICATE WORK OF
                            OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES SUCH AS THE JUNE 1972 ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE,
                            AUGUST 1974 POPULATION CONFERENCE, THE 1975 MID-TERM REVIEW AND
                            APPRAISAL EXERCISE FOR UN'S SECOND DEVELOPMENT DECADE AND THE
                            MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS (<gloss target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss>),
                            EVEN THOUGH RELATED TO FOOD QUESTION. IN THIS CONNECTION, WE SHOULD
                            STRESS THAT UN BODIES CAN REACH POLICY CONCLUSIONS WHICH REPRESENT MORAL
                            OR POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS TO UNDERTAKE BEST EFFORTS TO CARRY THEM OUT BUT
                            THEY ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE SEE WORK OF
                            CONFERENCE AS DIRECTED TO GETTING AGREEMENT ON BROAD PRINCIPLES WHICH
                            CAN SERVE AS FRAMEWORK FOR THE WORK OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORA AND OF
                            MEMBER GOVERNMENTS ON FOOD PROBLEM. THUS, MTN COULD BE FACILITATED IF
                            WFC IN LINE WITH PARA 10D BELOW WOULD REITERATE TOKYO DECLARATION ON
                            NEED FOR EXPANSION OF WORLD TRADE IN BASIC FOODS THROUGH REDUCTION OF
                            OBSTACLES TO THEIR IMPORT AND EXPORT AND IF THE WFC WOULD REGISTER ITS
                            HOPE THAT THE MTN WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS ALONG THESE LINES.</p>
                        <p>7. BECAUSE OF NATURAL AND HUMAN UNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE
                            TRENDS IN PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF BASIC FOODS AND SOME IMPORTANT
                            GAPS IN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON CURRENT SITUATIONS, WE FEEL MAIN THRUST
                            OF WFC SHOULD BE ON PROBLEMS AND REMEDIAL ACTIONS IN THE MEDIUM TERM,
                            BETWEEN NOW AND 1980, THOUGH WE CANNOT DISREGARD SOME ACTIONS WHICH MUST
                            AT LEAST BE INITIATED IN THIS PERIOD TO PRODUCE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF
                            FOOD AVAILABILITY FOR THE LONGER RUN.</p>
                        <p>8. WE HAVE REACHED NO FIRM CONCLUSION ON WHICH FOOD PRODUCTS SHOULD BE
                            CENTER OF ATTENTION, BUT GIVEN LIMITATIONS ALREADY CITED WE THINK
                            PRINCIPAL EMPHASIS SHOULD BE THE MAJOR FOOD CROPS SUCH AS GRAINS,
                            SOYBEANS AND FOOD LEGUMES.</p>
                        <p>9. IMMEDIATE NEED IS TO REACH AGREEMENT ON AGENDA AT PREPCOM MEETING
                            SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 11. AT THIS STAGE WE FEEL AGENDA SHOULD BE IN
                            SKELETON FORM WITH MORE DETAILS TO BE FILLED IN IF NECESSARY AS
                            DISCUSSIONS AMONG GOVERNMENTS IN AND OUT OF PREPCOM REVEAL IN MORE
                            DETAIL THE ISSUES ON WHICH IT IS FOUND TO BE DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE TO
                            SEEK CONFERENCE ACTION. PREFER CONCENTRATE NEGOTIATING TIME OF
                            SUBSEQUENT PREPCOMS ON RESOLUTIONS WHICH SHOULD EMERGE FROM WFC ON EACH
                            AGENDA ITEM RATHER THAN ON DEVELOPMENT OF A DETAILED AGENDA.</p>
                        <p>10. OUR OUTLINE AS OF NOW IS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                        <p>A. REVIEW OF PRESENT AND MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK FOR FOOD SUPPLIES, WITH
                            EMPHASIS ON IDENTIFYING SHORTAGES OF BASIC FOODSTUFFS AND NUTRITIONAL
                            DEFICIENCIES AND ON WAYS TO IMPROVE THE DATA FLOW AND ANALYSIS ON THESE
                            SUBJECTS.</p>
                        <p>B. POLICIES FOR STOCKPILING OF BASIC FOODS TO PROVIDE GREATER FOOD
                            SECURITY, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO MEANS FOR MEETING DISASTER-TYPE
                            SITUATIONS.</p>
                        <p>C. NEW LOOKS AT FOOD AID, ALSO IN PART RELATED TO DISASTER PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>D. MEASURES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF
                            BASIC FOODS. THEMES UNDER THIS HEARING, IN ADDITION TO THE REFERENCE TO
                            TRADE IN PARA 6, COULD INCLUDE HIGHER PRIORITY FOR AGRICULTURAL
                            INVESTMENT AND IMPROVED PRICE POLICIES FOR BASIC FOODS IN COUNTRIES WITH
                            SERIOUS NUTRITIONAL PROBLEMS; HIGHER PRIORITY FOR SPECIAL NUTRITION
                            PROGRAMS; INCREASING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY THROUGH MORE RAPID SPREAD OF
                            IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES; INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL INPUTS (AT
                            REALISTIC PRICES) ESPECIALLY FERTILIZERS; IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY OF
                            AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY OF SMALL
                            FARMERS; REDUCTION OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING COSTS ESPECIALLY
                            THROUGH REDUCED WASTE AND IMPROVED TRANSPORT AND STORAGE FACILITIES; AND
                            MAINTENANCE OF HIGH LEVEL OF COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL
                            RESEARCH ON WAYS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN LONGER TERM OF PRODUCTION OF
                            BASIC FOODS. WE ARE NOT YET READY TO DECIDE WHETHER ALL SHOULD BE
                            ADDRESSED OR IF NOT, WHICH.</p>

                        <p>Preparations for World Food Conference</p>
                        <p>To inform myself on state of US Government preparations and thinking I
                            have met with officials from all interested US agencies, from <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            and <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> and from private agencies in
                            Washington and New York (List at Tab A).</p>
                        <p>Everywhere I have met a warm reception and a desire to be helpful.
                            Contrary to my previous experience with international economic policy
                            and my expectations in this case, I now predict that more negotiating
                            will be required with foreigners than within US Government. This is
                            reflected in fact that there were no difficulties in clearing with all
                            interested the attached cable (at Tab B) designed both to check out
                            present agency views, inform our missions of where we stand and start
                            the important process of consultation with other governments and the UN
                            agencies. It also will bring you up to date on the present status of the
                            organization of the Conference.</p>
                        <p>I am setting up a small staff consisting of a junior <gloss
                                target="#t_FSO1">FSO</gloss> as my Special Assistant, a senior
                            officer loaned to me by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BEL1"
                                >Butz</persName> whom I would propose, should act as my Deputy, and
                            a food expert loaned to me by Administrator Parker. I see them primarily
                            as channels to the staffs of their agencies and assistants in
                            negotiations. The basic work will have to be done by the permanent
                            staffs of Agriculture, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and
                            State.</p>
                        <p>The principal substantive problems I can now foresee are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Since you called for a World Food Conference and to some extent since
                            the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> approved your initiative, the
                            unprecedented increase in oil prices has created an atmosphere of
                            uncertainty in many developing and developed countries concerning their
                            domestic economic health and their international economic relations.
                            Until this situation is stabilized, it may be difficult for governments
                            to 'undertake or even give serious attention to improvements in the
                            world food position over the next 5-10 years. It will be necessary to
                            watch this closely.</p>
                        <p>2. Present predictions are for a substantial shortage of production
                            capacity for nitrogenous fertilizers over the next 5 years unless a
                            major capacity expansion program is started soon, running in the order
                            of 30-35 billion according to a recent AID memo. Some of the Middle East
                            oil exporters have not only the capital but flared gas now wasted that
                            can be converted into fertilizer. They lack the technical capacity to
                            build and operate the plants. The <gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss>
                            might try to launch a collaborative effort to meet this problem although
                            again a political push from you may be required. I might add that it
                            should be possible to persuade the Arabs to export fertilizer to <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s at special low prices since the
                            possibility of leakage to developed countries is far less than in the
                            case of oil.</p>
                        <p>3. More immediately, unless adequate action is taken in next few months
                            to assure that reasonable levels of nitrogenous fertilizers reach
                            farmers of major grain producing developing countries, despite general
                            oil shortages and oil and foreign exchange shortages of LDC's, the WFC
                            will only be able to try to deal with emergency food needs, rather than
                            discussing future policies, especially given low levels of stocks held
                            by major grain exporters.</p>
                        <p>4. LDC's are likely to seek to convert WFC into general development
                            conference and to give much higher priority to trade issues than we
                            think appropriate. On other hand, <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> may
                            wish to exclude trade entirely, a position we would regret.</p>
                        <p>5. In any case it may be difficult to meet the probable expectations of
                            LDC's that the US took the initiative in proposing WFC because it was so
                            concerned about future prospects that it was prepared to undertake major
                            new commitments I don't now see what new actions US is ready to take
                            which would meet these expectations. Due to the oil crisis, other
                            developed countries may be in an even worse position to be positive; in
                            fact, it may be difficult to prevent reductions in their aid flows.</p>
                        <p>6. A lot of work is still needed to spell out the mechanics of and the
                            incentives for others in the "international network of national
                            stockpiles" of basic foods which FAO has proposed and we endorse as a
                            concept.</p>
                        <p>7. There are, as yet, no encouraging signs of the willingness of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China, both highly
                            important in grain production and trade, to participate responsibly in
                            the work of the Conference. We will probably need your help on this
                            later.</p>
                        <p>8. I fear that, as is often the case, most countries will be represented
                            in the PrepCom by members of their UN delegations, most of whom have
                            more skill and experience at political debate than at solving world food
                            problems. In addition to the use of our missions, I propose considerable
                            travel by the staff and myself to arouse the interest in the WFC of the
                            responsible authorities in the principally interested countries.</p>

                            <lb/>FROM: <persName corresp="#p_MRJ3">BOB MORRIS</persName> [BM
                            initialed]</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Food Plan</p>
                        <p>This is a summary of where we stand and what we hope to accomplish as
                            regards the international aspects of U.S. food (or, more broadly,
                            agricultural) policy. As we see it, the coming international debate on
                            food policy will focus on three highly inter-related issues concerning
                            the production, demand and international distribution of food
                            supplies:</p>
                        <p>1) Conditions under which international commercial trade will take place
                            in future. This is probably the key to the whole exercise since trade
                            conditions determine in large measure levels of production and
                            productivity of our producers of most crop agriculture. (Specific
                            negotiations to occur in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            multilateral trade negotiations, which will get underway in earnest
                            after our trade bill passes--presumably by early summer).</p>
                        <p>2) Possible new international agreements concerning the creation,
                            maintenance and release of stocks of key commodities (foodgrains,
                            feedgrains, oilseeds and perhaps others such as cotton) for commercial
                            trade purposes, either by governments or private traders. A sub-category
                            here will probably be the issue of access to supplies and possibly new
                            agreements on rules for long-term supply contracts. Again, specific
                            agreements will have to be negotiated in the <gloss target="#t_MTN1"
                                >MTN</gloss> since they will heavily influence commercial trading
                            conditions and the degree to which trade may be liberalized.</p>
                        <p>3) Potential new arrangements on food aid to <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s, including disaster relief and measures designed to
                            increase agricultural productivity and fight malnutrition in LDC's. Much
                            of the <gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss> discussion will center on
                            this issue. However, given the fact that food aid is an alternative to
                            commercial purchases, new rules or agreements on food aid practices by
                            supplying and importing countries will have to be consistent with the
                            arrangements developed for (1) and (2) above. Thus, specific agreements
                            should be negotiated out in parallel with those on trade, stock and
                            supply access policies.</p>
                        <p>We have two international fora in which these issues will be debated
                            during the coming year: the WFC in November and the MTN (which will
                            carry through 1975 and maybe longer). The agreed U.S. strategy is to
                            limit the WFC to a definition of "general principles" which should
                            govern international cooperation in the food area as that cooperation is
                            worked out in matters of trade, stock and food aid policies. Specific
                            agreements, translating these principles into operational practices,
                            should be negotiated in the MTN.</p>
                        <p>This strategy is generally supported by most developed countries, but
                            many LDCs will surely try (unsuccessfully) to have the WFC agree on
                            specific commitments on particular issues. Given the interdependence
                            among these issues, we cannot allow this to happen without sacrificing
                            our main objective of a new regime for trade in agriculture which
                            permits liberalized market access for our farmers and greater stability
                            in international trade. Since our farmers depend on export markets for
                            the sale of the products of about one out of every three acres cropped
                            in the U.S., this objective is of vital importance to us.</p>
                        <p>The question of timing of new initiatives is therefore critical. Our
                            chances for success rest mainly on our ability to negotiate new
                            international agreements on these issues. A premature initiative risks
                            rejection (and consequent defeat for the President if he makes it a
                            personal "<persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Food Plan").
                            Waiting too long before the WFC convenes and the MTN gets down to
                            serious business would mean we would have to overcome foreign positions
                            which were becoming increasingly firm and unchangeable. Sometime this
                            summer would thus seem about right.</p>
                        <p>To prepare the substance of U.S. proposals and objectives, <gloss
                                target="#t_CIEP1">CIEP</gloss> has commissioned two major
                            interagency studies: CIEPSM 30 on alternative schemes for stock policies
                            in commercial trade, and CIEPSM 31 on alternatives for a new U.S. food
                            aid policy and international agreements on food aid. The former is about
                            ready for interagency review and for high-level consideration by,
                            perhaps, early March. The latter is due for submission to us by the end
                            of March and high-level consideration in April. The decisions taken at
                            those times will govern our positions and negotiating objectives for the
                            WFC and will be integrated into our trade liberalization strategy for
                            the MTN. (We are also pursuing a less formal interagency effort on
                            long-term supply contracts which, as I indicated above, will also figure
                            in the debate on stock policies). We would hope that, by May, we would
                            have developed a reasonably coherent set of proposals for U.S. policy
                            and a negotiating strategy to implement it.</p>
                        <p>Assuming we accept <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Deane Hinton's</persName>
                            view that it would be well to test the international water on our
                            chances for success before the President commits his personal prestige
                            on the line, we would float some of our ideas in general terms at the
                            June WFC preparatory committee meeting and in private diplomatic
                            channels. If all goes well, the President could then make a policy
                            statement in July, encompassing whatever new domestic initiatives your
                            side comes up with. If our international soundings indicate resistance
                            to certain ideas in our package, we can consider then whether to modify
                            them or try to push them through anyway. In either case, July appears to
                            be the earliest practicable time for a new "Nixon Plan."</p>
                        <p>CIEP, of course, will continue as prime White House coordinator for the
                            international aspects of this effort, including the definition of policy
                            alternatives and the management of decision-making on theme We should
                            devise at least a workable informal mechanism to assure that our effort
                            moves in parallel with whatever you will do and that we are both working
                            toward mutually reinforcing and compatible objectives. I would welcome
                            any suggestions you have for this.</p>

                            for First Meeting only, but at close was confirmed for two subsequent
                            sessions for which US had pressed. He did an excellent job.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_MSA1">Marei</persName> performed
                            well and was warmly welcomed by all participants.</p>
                        <p>Meeting was largely confined to preliminary staking out of positions and
                            protection of options in course of debate on agenda and on work program
                            of Secretariat in preparation for next meeting in Geneva June 4 This
                            discussion was pleasantly open with little evidence of bloc solidarity
                            although 77 were meeting regularly and nonaligned from time to time.
                            Western powers didn't always agree and several US statements were
                            endorsed by a wide range of developing countries.</p>
                        <p>The USSR requested postponement of final action on the agenda until
                            PrepCom II on grounds that it was based on FAO debate in which it had
                            not participated and had received text only ten days in advance. US
                            supported as courtesy and because delay would provide more time for
                            other governments to consider amendments to agenda proposed by U.S.</p>
                        <p>Only light on Soviet substantive approach came from statements by them or
                            Eastern Europeans emphasizing that stockpiling policies were entirely
                            for national decision and reserving position on provision of data to
                            "Early Warning" system on food shortages. This represents somewhat
                            negative but hardly unexpected attitude on two points on which
                            cooperation by Soviets is important to better handling of world food
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>It would appear now that trade in foods is the issue on which the U.S.
                            may have the most trouble though our position is to some extent a middle
                            ground between the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and the 77 and
                            though the 77 have few directly relevant interests to press.</p>
                        <p>I had an opportunity to refer to the points you made in your opening
                            statement to the Energy Conference with respect to the impacts of the
                            oil crisis on LDCs and especially the threat presented by the fertilizer
                            shortage. U.S. interest in latter problem was warmly welcomed by several
                            major LDCs.</p>

                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations recently invited a group of 30
                            agricultural experts from three nations (US, Canada, and Australia),
                            with working experiences in many more, to participate in a seminar on
                            World Food Perspectives. This report summarizes the views expressed at
                            the seminar.</p>
                        <p>The participants agreed that knowledge and farm practices presently
                            available could support a large further increase in food production in
                            both developed countries (<gloss target="#t_DCs1">DCs</gloss>) and less
                            developed countries (LDCs). But the problems to be overcome in realizing
                            this increase are substantial, and their consideration led to much
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Five basic assumptions underlaid all projections: (1) normal weather; (2)
                            no land-use restrictions; (3) favorable price incentives; (4) adequate
                            supplies of production inputs; and (5) continuing research and education
                            to maintain yield increases. The experts' estimates of capacities for
                            expansion ranged from 30 to 50 percent into the early 1980s.</p>
                        <p>The discussion brought out that attainment of such an expansion would
                            require very substantial capital investments in the agricultural and
                            agribusiness sectors in the developed countries. Also, the projections
                            assumed that petroleum and fertilizer supplies would be available, at
                            higher prices but with cost/benefit ratios still favorable to farm
                            products.</p>
                        <p>For the LDCs, capital investments also are important, with emphasis on
                            public investments and water control programs. Much pessimism was
                            expressed because: (1) cost-price ratios in LDCs have improved less than
                            in DCs (with exceptions) (2) fertilizer supplies to LDCs have been
                            reduced substantially and their prices have increased dramatically; and
                            (3) the programs to create and communicate new technology have a spotty
                            success pattern among LDCs. Recent price changes and input shortages
                            discourage the use of modern technology, despite the clear evidence that
                            this is the only available means of attaining the higher yields which
                            are essential if <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> food production
                            capacity is to be increased.</p>
                        <p>Despite these needs, several participants expressed the view that the
                            World Food Conference, to be convened this coming November, will fail to
                            accomplish any significant purpose. The ensuing discussion identified a
                            number of possible (and partially conflicting) purposes. The consensus
                            was that a successful World Food Conference will require much careful
                            preparatory work, along with much international agreement before the
                            Conference convenes, and should focus on certain enduring problems.</p>
                        <p>Possible strategies for an international grain reserve, the seminar's
                            final topic, might include limiting access to the reserve to nations
                            that cooperate in furnishing full information on production,
                            consumption, and domestic inventories, along with suitable financial
                            contributions to the cost of maintaining such a reserve. The strategy
                            would also require the building of government inventories in surplus
                            years to be drawn on in years of deficits, leaving privately held stocks
                            to meet shorter term demand/supply fluctuations. The LDCs, at least
                            those with limited financial resources, could participate on a less
                            stringent basis, provided that they supplied full information for
                            adequate grain reserve operational planning.</p>

                        <p>US Position for World Food Conference</p>
                        <p>I. Summary </p>
                        <p>The basic concept underlying US initiatives in the World Food Conference
                            is that over the next ten years world needs for basic foods may well put
                            greater pressure than in the post-war years on world production
                            capacity. This prospect must be viewed against the recent depletion of
                            world grain stocks. In order not only to maintain nutritional levels but
                            also to improve those of persons now undernourished, it therefore
                            becomes necessary to step up present national and international efforts
                            to increase food production. We must also be better prepared to avoid
                            excessive price increases and to maintain adequate consumption levels in
                            the face of the fluctuations in food production which are the inevitable
                            result of unpredictable weather, other natural disasters, public
                            disorders, etc. Steps toward achieving these objectives should result in
                            a wider sharing of present heavy U.S. responsibility for stocks and food
                            aid and better market access for US food exports.</p>
                        <p>II. I propose to spell out the US concept for the World Food Conference
                            under the main headings of the Agenda for the Conference which, though
                            still provisional, will probably be adopted without substantial
                            change.</p>
                        <p>1. Assessment of Present Situation and its Causes</p>
                        <p>Though the data on how many people are undernourished and by how much are
                            unreliable, there is no doubt that at least several hundred million
                            people don't get enough to eat. The most serious situation is that of
                            pregnant and. nursing mothers and infants between weaning and about
                            three years. Inadequate nutrition for these groups, especially protein
                            shortages, appears to cause lifelong and irreversible loss of physical
                            and mental capacity.</p>
                        <p>The causes are various, but include inadequate income, unavailability of
                            the right foods, undesirable traditional eating habits, and absence of
                            information about proper diet.</p>
                        <p>In most developed countries, the current problem is the unusually high
                            cost of most food, though considerable malnutrition also exists,
                            including in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. Assessment of Future Prospects</p>
                        <p>To get a better fix on short-term prospects, the US proposed at the First
                            PrepCom that one conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss>
                            should be to improve the flow of data on basic food stocks and crop
                            prospects to a central point where they could be carefully analyzed to
                            provide better early-warning of major food shortages than we have had to
                            date. I foresee no opposition to this except perhaps from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Over the longer term, it seems likely that various factors will combine
                            to raise food demand over the next ten years at a rate of at least 4%
                            per annum and for grain somewhat more. These include world population
                            growth at 75-80 million people a year, rising incomes, expanding demand
                            for meat (7 lbs. of grain = 1 lb. of beef), and better diets for those
                            still very poor.</p>
                        <p>On the supply side, there are many uncertainties. While we can count on
                            further improvements in technology, their application has in past spread
                            slowly, especially in developing countries where there still are the
                            biggest gaps between average yields and those achieved by "good
                            farmers". Increasing the land-water availability for food production is
                            steadily more costly. Weather is still uncontrollable and not even
                            reliably predictable. Nor can major help be counted on soon from
                            "artificial" foods or food fortification. The major source of expanded
                            grain supply in the next few years is apt still to be North America.</p>
                        <p>3. Measures for Increasing Food Production and Consumption in Developing
                            Countries</p>
                        <p>At the First Preparatory Committee Meeting, the US suggested that in
                            addition to expanding output, the cost-efficiency with which food was
                            produced and distributed was as important as the amount produced. Only
                            by improved efficiency is it possible to reconcile the conflicting needs
                            to improve farmers’ incomes and to enable the undernourished consumer to
                            eat better without spending more of his income on food. We stressed the
                            importance of distribution costs -- wasteful transport and storage
                            facilities and inefficient marketing systems.</p>
                        <p>4. Strengthening World Food Security through Stockholding Emergency and
                            Food Aid</p>
                        <p>On stockpiling, the US position is still in a preliminary stage. An
                            international program in this field raises many difficult issues of
                            international and domestic politics, as well as hard technical ones.
                            However, there is US agreement that food stockpiles should be held by
                            both exporting and importing countries (especially Japan, USSR and
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> countries), taking off the US the
                            main responsibility for financing them, and that they should be national
                            rather than international under internationally agreed guidelines on
                            whose implementation governments should exchange full information and
                            have frequent consultations. </p>
                        <p>The US position on food aid is also still under interdepartmental
                            discussion, but again it is clear that we wish other donors to assume a
                            larger share of its financing.</p>
                        <p>On both stockpiling and food aid, the US approach is to seek agreement at
                            the WFC on general guiding principles with the specifics of firm
                            undertakings to be worked out in the <gloss target="#t_MTN1"
                            >MTN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> or other appropriate
                            bodies.</p>
                        <p>5. International Trade and International Agricultural Adjustment</p>
                        <p>The US hopes that the WFC will agree that there is need for expansion of
                            world trade in basic foods through reduction of obstacles to their
                            import and export and will register its wish that the MTN would be able
                            to make progress along these lines.</p>
                        <p>III. Preparatory Problems</p>
                        <p>Two points deserve mention:</p>
                        <p>1. In respect to the goal of increasing production and consumption in
                            developing countries, your initiative on the. WFC has apparently
                            encouraged some developing countries to feel that the US was willing to
                            commit important new resources to help them improve their situations. We
                            do not yet have a response to this hope.</p>
                        <p>2. I wish to repeat a little more strongly the concern expressed in my
                            memorandum to you of January 18 that, even with average or better
                            weather this year, by November the food situation and the prospects for
                            1975 could be so serious in a number of developing countries, especially
                            in South and Southeast Asia, accentuated by the scarcity of nitrogen
                            fertilizers, that the main concern of the WFC may have to be where to
                            find grain and fertilizer to prevent a major disaster. It is essential
                            that the US follow developments closely over the next six months and be
                            prepared to take new types of initiatives if necessary to prevent a
                            famine from developing.</p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Task Group on the International
                            Fertilizer Situation is now meeting weekly to seek ways to improve
                            near-term availability of nitrogen fertilizers to developing countries.
                            It is too soon to predict what we can achieve. <gloss target="#t_SP2"
                                >S/P</gloss> and my office are planning to bring a group of outside
                            experts together shortly to get their assessments of the food supply
                            outlook.</p>
                        <p>While there is a considerable range of uncertainty on how serious the
                            food shortage in developing areas may be in the 74-75 period, even with
                            average weather, I think that if US harvests are close to the present
                            Department of Agriculture high figures, we may find it prudent to set
                            aside a reserve for emergencies rather than permitting it all to be
                            exported commercially, as will probably be possible. A Department of
                            Agriculture paper on US stockpiling policy is now being considered by an
                            inter-departmental committee, chaired by <gloss target="#t_EB1"
                                >EB</gloss>. Among its five options are one or two which would
                            permit such acquisitions, though they may not be ones preferred at
                            present by some top Agriculture officials.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep you informed on progress on both these points, as well as
                            any new ideas we can uncover.</p>

                        <p>Senator Humphrey said that he thought the Secretary's <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Speech was great. The Secretary thanked
                            him, welcomed the opportunity to discuss the food problem and noted that
                            he would like to speak with the Senator alone for ten minutes after the
                            discussion of the food problem.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to food policy.]</p>
                        <p>Senator Humphrey turned to the food problem and said he had an outline
                            for his May 9 speech which contains some proposals the Secretary might
                            want to look at. The Secretary said that he would be delighted to do so
                            and noted that he was in the process of beating his people to follow up
                            the initiatives in his UN Speech, including those in the food area.
                            Senator Humphrey said there is an urgency in the world food situation
                            that goes beyond the World Food Conference. The need on a worldwide
                            basis is $3 to 4 billion in new assistance for the so-called Fourth
                            World. The challenge for the U.S. is to put down some earnest money
                            toward this goal and to do so in the form of food aid since this is the
                            area where we are the main producers and the key factor in the world
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Under his proposal, Senator Humphrey continued, Fourth World countries
                            (the lowest income LDCs) would purchase food grains at the world market
                            prices, with that part representing the July 1, 1972 price being paid on
                            commercial terms and the balance being sold on highly concessional
                            terms, that is, the softest PL 480 Title I terms. The U.S. would use the
                            PL 480 mechanism to finance the concessional part. The Senator believed
                            that the Congress would cooperate with the Administration in supporting
                            a US initiative along these lines. The Secretary asked whether it was
                            correct that grain prices had roughly doubled since July 1, 1972. The
                            Senator replied that this was about correct. He said the proposal would
                            amount to selling wheat for about $1.80 per bushel cash and about $1.80
                            in long-term credit -- assuming that the price falls to about $3.60. The
                            Secretary asked whether the United States would do this alone under the
                            Senator's proposal or whether others would have to join in. The Senator
                            replied that we would do it only if other food producers did the same,
                            in proportion to their share of the market.</p>
                        <p>The Senator said that although he planned to make this proposal in his
                            May 9 speech, his concern was getting the job done, not taking credit
                            for it. The Secretary responded that it would certainly not harm the
                            prospects for action of this kind if a proposal came first from Senator
                            Humphrey.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he couldn't agree more that something should be done
                            in the food area. He turned to Mr. Boeker and asked that he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ETO1">Enders</persName> staff out the
                            Senator's proposals in preparation for a discussion of them at the staff
                            meeting to consider follow up on his UN Speech.</p>
                        <p>The Senator said he wanted to urge the Secretary to take action on the
                            World Food Program as well. He said that at present the US commitment to
                            the World Food Program was limited to providing 32% of total pledges up
                            to a World Food Program level of $440 million. He thought it would be a
                            significant inducement to others to contribute more if the U.S. raised
                            this ceiling to $650 million; the maximum US contribution would then be
                            32% of $650 million or $280 million. He said that no Congressional
                            authorization would be required for the Administration to take this
                            step.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Boeker asked the Senator how one would deal with the effect
                            significantly increased PL 480 could have on domestic prices. Senator
                            Humphrey responded that in the post-World War II era the United States
                            had given away virtually every last grain of food we had in our
                            reserves. By way of contrast, we now have 175 million bushels of wheat
                            in reserves. By July, the Senator continued, we should have 450 million
                            bushels in reserves. If we get a good wheat crop we will have a good
                            grain crop.</p>
                        <p>Senator Humphrey stressed that what he wanted was that the Department of
                            State get on top of the Department of Agriculture, which he described as
                            being dominated by domestic considerations, and a very conservative view
                            of domestic considerations at that. He was convinced that the amounts of
                            grains he was talking about could be declared as "available" under
                            existing PL 480 criteria -- perhaps with a little stretching. However,
                            if the Department of State thought that PL 480 availability criteria
                            need to be amended to facilitate a program of the kind he was
                            describing, he could guarantee such an amendment.</p>
                        <p>On fertilizer, Senator Humphrey noted that he had not yet thought through
                            all the implications of this aspect of his outlined speech. He did
                            think, however, that the key factor to concentrate on was that $1 of US
                            fertilizer exports produces $5 worth of crops in developing countries.
                            He noted that he himself had earlier urged the Cost of Living Council to
                            include an export restraint on fertilizer in its action lifting price
                            controls on fertilizer. But perhaps one should now take a different
                            view. He stressed that the existing application of fertilizer by farmers
                            in the United States is wasteful. At recent prices, applications of
                            fertilizer have apparently been so heavy that the marginal returns must
                            be very low.</p>
                        <p>One thing we certainly need to do, Senator Humphrey continued, is to get
                            the World Bank into the fertilizer field, particularly in the Middle
                            East where large amounts of natural gas are being flared. The Secretary
                            noted that we will definitely do something in this area. The Senator
                            said that the United States should even agree to purchase some of the
                            output of Middle East fertilizer plants if that was necessary to make
                            such projects go.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the recent supplemental Foreign Assistance requests, Senator
                            Humphrey said that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has been under a
                            lot of pressure to divert funds from Agricultural programs to other
                            purposes. He said that we (the Senate?) do not like this. He personally
                            supported the continuation of some transfer authority in Foreign
                            Assistance legislation, but said that this would become difficult if
                            there were too much goosing around with this provision. He hoped this
                            would not be the case with the funds for agriculture in the supplemental
                            request.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he considered food and energy, and after that raw
                            materials, to be the big new problems in international relations. In
                            these areas we have to be innovative and demonstrate US leadership. The
                            U.S. does have the capability to lead on the food problem, and we can
                            thereby set an example for energy producers and others. The Secretary
                            noted that he had a meeting scheduled May 14 with outside experts on the
                            world food problem. The Senator said he was delighted and wanted through
                            his staff to suggest additional names for the Secretary's consideration.
                            Ambassador Martin said that he would he in touch with Mr. Cardero to get
                            his thoughts on further names.</p>
                        <p>In closing the Secretary noted that he was very sympathetic to the
                            Senator's point of view on these issues and that we would be pressing
                            consideration within the Government on food issues looking towards some
                            fairly firm decisions by the end of May.</p>

                        <p>[<persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName>:] <lb/>On food aid and
                            stockpiling, a debate is developing. <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> and his friends think we should have a large
                            Government food reserve. I disagree. We are out of the food reserve
                            business and I think we should stay out. We carried the world food
                            reserve and everyone got soft -- they didn't have to plan. We need food
                            reserves, but they can be carried by private industry and foreign
                            governments. We have carried the lion's share of production aid for
                            years, going back to the Marshall Plan.</p>
                        <p>President: The whole idea that if we feed the world there will be peace
                            is nonsense. But taking an area like the Middle East, if we develop a
                            new relationship with the Arabs, the Middle East is one of the hungriest
                            areas of the world. Food is indispensable in our foreign policy. The
                            Soviet Union is providing arms to the Arabs; we can counter here. If we
                            tried to give arms both to Israel and the Arabs, there would be a hell
                            of a fuss raised.</p>
                        <p>The United States should move away from multilateral to bilateral aid.
                            Keep this in mind at the World Food Conference. We need it for foreign
                            policy. As our military assistance recedes, we need other bilateral aid.
                            The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> sort of thing is OK, but we need
                            this tool for our foreign policy. This has to be closely held, because
                            it goes against the grain of the altruists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJA1">Scali</persName>: We can count our bilateral
                            aid toward world goals, and we can't look too selfish.</p>
                        <p>President: OK, but let's have no illusion that we need to be able to
                            influence governments and what they do. The World Bank does a fine job,
                            but it is not an effective instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
                            Frequently, it has not helped where we wanted and has helped countries
                            where it was not in our interest.</p>

                        <p>Issues in Our Approach to the World Food Problem</p>
                        <p>You requested a paper on the international and domestic issues we face in
                            developing a coherent approach to the world food problem and,
                            separately, a comprehensive look at PL 480 priorities. This paper
                            discusses PL 480 as one element in our overall food policy. A separate
                            paper will examine in detail the specific problems of PL 480 criteria
                            and priorities.</p>
                        <p>Pending your further guidance, we are working towards an Administration
                            decision to double food aid in FY 1975 from the currently budgeted level
                            of 4.5 million tons to 9 million tons. With wheat prices falling and a
                            record US wheat crop in the offing, the main obstacle to this increase
                            would be budgetary. Our strategy is thus to build for agreement with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> on a program increase
                            which you and he could then put to <persName corresp="#p_ARL1"
                                >Ash</persName>. Enders is starting a country by country analysis
                            with Agriculture next week in an effort to define areas of agreement. We
                            will then come back to you to seal a bargain with Butz.</p>
                        <p>As we proposed in an 18 May memorandum to you on follow through to your
                            United Nations General Assembly speech, our target is still for you to
                            announce a substantial increase in food aid in a speech by July 15.</p>
                        <p>SETTING</p>
                        <p>A. Elements of World Food Security</p>
                        <p>Food security means that world production plus reserves are adequate to
                            protect normal consumption against year-to-year variations in production
                            within an acceptable range of prices. This is not currently the case.
                            Food security requires rebuilding world stocks to a level adequate to
                            cover the next bad crop year. In addition to stockpiles, world food
                            security embraces three other major elements amenable to prompt
                            international action: investment in agriculture, food aid, and trade
                            relationships. A fifth element, population control, is critical in the
                            longer term, but is much more resistant to governmental policy
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>B. Situation This Year</p>
                        <p>World food stocks are at the lowest level in two decades. World food
                            security this year depends on record US production, which we now expect.
                            Even so, severe production shortfalls this year or next in more than one
                            major region would create a food supply crisis involving unacceptable
                            price rises in the United States and starvation in the LDCs. The most
                            threatened areas are those of chronic shortage -- South Asia,
                            particularly India, and the African Sahel. <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> production for 1974 is still in doubt, but we think it
                            will be about average and will not be a cause for major Soviet
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>C. The Longer Term.</p>
                        <p>Normal, or better than normal, world crop conditions this year and next
                            will permit some rebuilding of stocks. A global balance of commercial
                            supply and demand through 1985 is likely -- but with the US and other
                            developed countries providing most of the exportable surplus and the
                            LDCs continuing to suffer malnutrition and pockets of starvation.
                            Substantially increased investment in agriculture will be required if
                            the LDCs as a group are to keep pace with rising consumption demands.
                            Even so they will probably have to import more food, at higher unit cost
                            than prior to 1973, while at the same time devoting more resources to
                            agricultural development.</p>
                        <p>D. Dominant Position of the US</p>
                        <p>The US has the largest food production capacity in excess of domestic
                            requirements. We dominate world trade in soybeans and feedgrains. We are
                            the principal exporter of both wheat and rice. The US and Canada have
                            carried a large part of the worlds grain reserves over the past thirty
                            years. The US has provided 85 percent of all food aid.</p>
                        <p>Our commanding position with respect to food is an asset in our dealings
                            with the LDCs and the importing DCs. It also imposes a humanitarian
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES</p>
                        <p>The two central problems in developing <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> positions on specific food policy issues are:</p>
                        <p>-- What balance is to be struck between foreign policy considerations,
                            including world food security and the problems of commercial
                            agricultural trade, and the domestic policy requirements to maintain
                            farm income at reasonable food prices?</p>
                        <p>-- What mix of policies and programs with respect to US production,
                            agricultural development assistance, food aid, stockpiles and trade
                            relationships best serves both our foreign policy and domestic
                            interests?</p>
                        <p>Implicit in the second of these central problems is the question of how
                            to harmonize, to the extent possible, US interests and policies with
                            those, of other governments. Given our dominant position in the world
                            food picture, the tactics of negotiating and implementing the
                            international aspects of our food policy will be important in getting
                            other governments to move in directions we believe necessary or
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>In important respects the international aspects of US food policy in the
                            post-war period have been a derivative, politically and economically, of
                            domestic agricultural policies which produced chronic surpluses. Our
                            capability to provide large amounts of food aid and to use it flexibly
                            for foreign policy purposes has not been the result of foreign policy
                            planning. As long as domestic agricultural policies encouraged or
                            permitted excess production, for which food aid was a widely approved
                            and low cost means of disposal, world food problems appeared less
                            threatening. For a variety of reasons we do not favor a return to such
                            an overwhelming US stockpiling and food aid role. Future world food
                            security requires, therefore, a greater measure of international
                            cooperation and burdensharing. For the US this means that foreign policy
                            considerations must receive more explicit and important weight in our
                            overall food strategy than has been true in the past.</p>
                        <p>A. The Domestic Issues: Income, Costs and Prices</p>
                        <p>There is no disagreement over the need to maintain farm income on a par
                            with the rest of the US economy. Issues arise over how this is to be
                            done. Until 1972, there were high budgetary costs for domestic and
                            export subsidies and for storage of vast quantities of grain. With the
                            disappearance of our surpluses through sales to the USSR and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>, even higher costs have been borne
                            directly by American consumers and by our commercial and concessional
                            customers abroad through sharply higher prices.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> prefers the present situation of
                            high prices and unregulated output because it minimizes direct budgetary
                            costs and, for the present at least, maximizes farm income. It receives
                            support from Treasury because of the lower budget costs and because of
                            the contribution of high priced commodity exports to our balance of
                            payments. <gloss target="#t_OMB1">OMB</gloss> also likes the reduced
                            budget requirements. Conversely, CEA and the Cost of Living Council are
                            interested in lower prices for American consumers -- even if this means
                            agricultural support payments.</p>
                        <p>Under present circumstances all of these agencies, to varying degrees,
                            will resist increased food aide. In a tight supply situation it detracts
                            from commercial exports or increases pressure on domestic prices.
                            However, the opposition of USDA, Treasury and OMB will diminish if food
                            prices continue to fall and, particularly, if USG-held stocks begin to
                            mount.</p>
                        <p>USDA under Earl Butz is strongly opposed to a return to USG-owned stocks.
                            The acquisition of stocks supports farm prices; once in existence they
                            have a price depressing effect. Because prices are then less affected by
                            current production, increases in production in response to future US or
                            world crop failures would be slower. However, with stocks, there is less
                            need for a quick production response.</p>
                        <p>USDA favors privately held stocks -- by farmers or traders. Other
                            agencies are less sure that such stocks would be adequate to ensure
                            reasonable price stability or the US position as a reliable
                            exporter.</p>
                        <p>B. Issues Deriving from Foreign Policy Considerations </p>
                        <p>1. Stockpiles</p>
                        <p>We have a strong foreign policy interest in world grain stocks adequate
                            to prevent the crisis conditions of the past year. While the US gains
                            some short-term political and economic advantages as the world's
                            principal food supplier in periods of short supply, we have larger
                            political, economic and humanitarian interests in food security. Without
                            reasonable supply stability, for which substantial stocks are necessary,
                            importing countries will seek self-sufficiency, even if at high domestic
                            costs, and US agricultural exports will decline. Food aid has been a
                            major expression of the American humanitarian impulse.</p>
                        <p>As a form of economic assistance it has supported US security and other
                            foreign policy interests. Without adequate world stocks food aid is
                            least available when most needed. We have had to reduce food aid levels
                            sharply this past year because of high domestic prices and in order to
                            avoid export controls.</p>
                        <p>Determining a reasonable or desirable level of world grain stocks is
                            primarily a statistical problem. What are the production and consumption
                            trends? What are the maximum historical shortfalls from trend in one or
                            a series of years? We can achieve a fair degree of international
                            agreement on this question although, for obvious reasons, food importing
                            nations will favor higher stocks and food exporters lower.</p>
                        <p>There are two major issues for US policy:</p>
                        <p>-- How should responsibility and the costs of stocks be shared among
                            nations?</p>
                        <p>-- To what extent, if at all, should we rebuild USG-held stocks?</p>
                        <p>The optimal resolution- of these issues from the US perspective would be
                            for other countries to purchase and stockpile US grain. We would
                            preserve and probably expand our export market, thus maintaining a high
                            level of production and farm income. Under such conditions a return to
                            USG-held stocks probably would not be necessary. This is the outcome
                            strongly preferred by USDA. Secretary Butz has stated repeatedly that
                            the USG will not again hold large stocks. He hopes that the implicit
                            threat to cut back US production if stocks begin to accumulate will
                            stimulate importing countries to build their own stocks. He accepts that
                            US and other DC assistance to the LDCs for this purpose will be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Butz position is tactically attractive. Because of this, and because
                            the support of USDA is important more generally in developing a food
                            policy that gives adequate weight to foreign policy interests, we
                            probably should avoid a direct confrontation with Butz on these issues
                            at this time. But, there are strong grounds for doubting that the Butz
                            approach will succeed, or succeed in the manner</p>
                        <p>[Missing 3 pages of document]</p>
                        <p>and population control assistance. A still broader frame might take into
                            account all forms of economic development assistance to the LDCs and
                            relative DC performances measured as a percentage of GNP.</p>
                        <p>SUMMARY ANALYSIS</p>
                        <p>The costs of accommodating foreign policy objectives in food policy are
                            mainly budgetary. Additional funds will be needed for a continuing and
                            flexible food aid program. The US, as the world's largest agricultural
                            exporter, will need to carry a substantial level of stocks. The private
                            sector probably will not hold enough to ensure reasonable stability in
                            food aid levels and to cover exceptional commercial demand. Some return
                            to USG-held stocks is likely. But we can and should seek a wider
                            international sharing of stock costs than has been true in the past.</p>
                        <p>The domestic policy objectives are to maintain farm income with high
                            production and reasonable prices. A sustained food aid program and
                            stockpiling can complement these objectives. Food aid channels some US
                            production to those who need it but cannot afford commercial purchases.
                            Food stocks can be managed to smooth out extreme supply and price
                            fluctuations.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the US has the potential for prolonged overproduction. In that
                            case, recourse must again be made to reducing production through acreage
                            set-asides. Here too we can seek cooperation of other major producers in
                            making production adjustments to share the burden equitably.</p>
                        <p>In agricultural trade, we should continue to seek improved market access
                            for US products. While we can and probably should move more quickly on
                            reaching international agreements, at least in principle, regarding food
                            aid and stocks, the US positions on these questions should be compatible
                            with our trade objectives -- which we hope to negotiate in the <gloss
                                target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss>. But, because prospects for improved
                            market access are not now very bright, we should avoid making this the
                            sine qua non for US positions on other food policy elements.</p>
                        <p>There are several foreign policy positions, leading to courses of action,
                            which we believe should be adopted. Assuming that the USG adopts a
                            policy of holding some food stocks, we should press for USSR agreement
                            at the World Food Conference to participate in a multilateral system of
                            national stockpiles and in an information exchange that could greatly
                            improve producers ability to forecast and meet production shortfalls.
                            Soviet cooperation is critical to the success of efforts to improve
                            world food security because they alone account for a large part of
                            production shortfalls.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary to establishing a nationally-operated stock system for
                            world food security, we should insist upon contributions from other DCs
                            (and perhaps the oil exporters) to finance food stock for the poorer
                            LDCs. This position is likely to draw criticism as an effort to obtain
                            financing from others for storing US-produced surpluses. But we should
                            argue that we will be forced to reduce production if international
                            cooperation is not attained.</p>
                        <p>We can anticipate a need for relatively high (pre-1973) levels of food
                            aid for the next several years -- perhaps the rest of the decade.
                            International cooperation is desirable. But US production potential and
                            efficiency argue for a continuing dominant US role -- with other DCs and
                            wealthy LDCs contributing proportionately more in other types of aid,
                            including agricultural development and population control assistance.
                            This course would preserve our ability to use food aid for specific
                            political objectives, as necessary and desirable.</p>
                        <p>In framing a comprehensive food policy, one of our main foreign policy
                            objectives should be to increase the world's per capita output of food
                            -- especially in the LDCs. Currently, food production in these countries
                            is barely keeping pace with population growth. Eventually we might
                            confront the Malthusian dilemma of a physical inability to feed the
                            world's population. But long before arriving at that point the food

                            Food aid should be viewed as a necessary but temporary device. Greater

                            PRODUCTION IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND CONSEQUENT NEED FOR AGRICULTURAL
                            DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND FINANCING OF NECESSARY
                            INPUTS, PARTICULARLY FERTILIZER. REDUCTIONS IN BARRIERS TO THEIR EXPORTS
                            AND LONGER TERM ARRANGEMENTS FOR FOOD AID WERE ALSO CONSISTENT ELEMENTS
                            OF LDC PRESENTATIONS. EASTERN EUROPEANS AND SOVIETS AVOIDED DISCUSSION
                            OF SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES, STRESSING IDEOLOGICAL SHORTCOMINGS OF ASSESSMENT,
                            I.E., ABSENCE OF REFERENCE TO NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF SOCIAL AND
                            ECONOMIC STRUCTURES. DC'S SPOKE OF NEED FOR UPDATING INFORMATION,

                            ANALYSIS TO DEFINE PROBLEM AREAS MORE CLOSELY. DC'S EXPRESSED GENERAL

                        <p>4. WORK ON AGENDA ALSO DEMONSTRATED HIGH LEVEL LDC CONCERN WITH FOOD

                            PREFERABLY ON CONCESSIONAL TERMS. SOME RELUCTANCE ACCEPT NEED TO IMPROVE

                            FOOD GOALS WERE TO BE REACHED, BUT UNDER PRESSURE DC'S POINT ACCEPTED IN

                        <p>6. SECOND PREPCOM IN GENERAL SHOWED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND
                            REASONABLE AMOUNT OF COHESION AMONG LDC'S WHO CAUCUSED SEVERAL TIMES IN
                            REGIONAL GROUPINGS AND AS <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> WHILE
                            SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS MADE ON BEHALF 77 BY ALGERIAN AS THEIR LEADER, ON
                            OTHER ISSUES THERE WAS FREQUENT INDIVIDUAL OR EVEN BLOC DISAGREEMENT,
                            WITH LATIN AMERICAN GROUP MOST OFTEN ALONE. <gloss target="#t_WEO1"
                                >WEO</gloss>'S HAD ONE GOOD MEETING BUT PRESENTED NO AGREED
                            POSITIONS. WHILE TRADE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION FROM LDC'S, WE
                            ARE HOPEFUL THAT TRADE DEBATES WITH THEM WILL NOT LOOM SO LARGE IN WFC
                            AS TO CONSTITUTE SERIOUS ADVERSE ELEMENT. </p>
                        <p>7. JUDGING FROM THEIR BEHAVIOR THUS FAR, EASTERN EUROPEANS AND SOVIETS
                            MAY BE FAIRLY NEUTRAL FACTOR IN WFC. SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS MADE ON
                            BEHALF OF GROUP BUT OTHERS NOT SO DESCRIBED. TWICE THEIR PROPOSALS
                            ATTACKED BY LDC'S AND PROMPTLY ABANDONED. IN DISCUSSION AGENDA, THEY
                            PROVED WARY NOT ONLY OF MENTION STOCKPILING AND FOOD AID BUT INCREASED
                            AID TO LDC FOOD PRODUCTION AS WELL. WHILE SOVIETS HAVE DEPUTY SECRETARY
                            GENERAL IN SECRETARIAT, HE HAS NOT ASSUMED ACTIVE ROLE.</p>
                        <p>8. AMONG DC'S, MAJOR GRAIN PRODUCERS HAVE SHOWN HIGHEST LEVEL OF
                            PREPARATION AND CONCERN. HOWEVER, EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IS SHOWING
                            INCREASED INTEREST AND HAS EXPRESSED DESIRE CONSULT CLOSELY WITH U.S. AS
                            POSITIONS ARE DEVELOPED. GERMAN DELEGATE MADE SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS ON
                            BEHALF <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> BUT UNITY NOT MAINTAINED ON ALL
                            ISSUES. U.S.-EC DIFFERENCES ON TRADE POLICIES STILL EVIDENT.</p>
                        <p>9. ON SPECIFIC WFC ISSUES, OUR POSITION ON ITEMS 3 AND 4 REMAINS AS

                            NEED FOR JOINT DONOR-RECIPIENT ACTIONS. ON STOCKPILING, WE HAVE
                            REITERATED OUR SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE FOR THE PROPOSAL OF FAO DIRECTOR
                            GENERAL BOERMA FOR AN INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL STOCKPILES. THIS
                            INVOLVES INTERNATIONALLY AGREED GUIDELINES FOR NATIONAL RESERVE
                            PROGRAMS, EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ON NATIONAL RESERVES AND CROP
                            PROSPECTS, AND REGULAR CONSULTATIONS ON THE RESERVE POLICIES OF
                            PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENTS AND ON THE FUTURE WORLD SUPPLY-DEMAND
                            SITUATION. MORE SPECIFIC U.S. POLICY ON FOOD AID AND FOOD RESERVES IS
                            CURRENTLY UNDERGOING INTENSIVE EXAMINATION WITHIN THE U.S.
                            GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>10. OUR ATTITUDE ON TRADE IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNCHANGED FROM THAT STATED IN
                            REFTEL. WE HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT TO LDC'S WITH SOME SUCCESS THAT
                            INTERESTS OF MOST OF THEM LIE IN ASSURED IMPORTS OF BASIC FOOD PRODUCTS
                            RATHER THAN DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOR OF THEIR FOOD EXPORTS, SINCE VAST
                            MAJORITY OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR SOME TIME
                            NET IMPORTERS OF SUCH COMMODITIES. </p>

                        <p>Trying to provide adequate world food supplies will become a problem of
                            over-riding priority in the years and decades immediately ahead -- and a
                            key role in any successful effort must fall to the US. Even in the most
                            favorable circumstances predictable, with increased devotion of scarce

                        <p>The momentum of world population growth, especially in the less developed
                            countries (LDCs), is such that even strong measures taken now to reduce
                            fertility would not stop rapid growth for decades. Thus, most LDCs must
                            cope with the needs of much larger populations or face the political and
                            other consequences of rising death rates.</p>
                        <p>Demand for food rises inexorably with the growth of population and of
                            affluence. Increases in supply are less certain. Manes age-old concerns
                            about the adequacy of food supplies have resumed with particular urgency
                            since the crop-failures of 1972.</p>
                        <p>The rich countries need have no fear of hunger, though the relative price
                            of food will probably rise at times.</p>
                        <p>The poor, food-deficit LDCs must produce most of the additional food they
                            will need to support their growing populations. They cannot afford to
                            import it, nor is it likely they can count on getting enough aid from
                            the food-exporting countries. They face serious political, economic, and
                            cultural obstacles to raising output, however, and are in for
                            considerable strain at the least, and probably for periods of
                            famine.</p>
                        <p>The US now provides nearly three-fourths of the world's net grain exports
                            and its role is almost certain to grow over the next several decades.
                            The world's increasing dependence on American surpluses portends an
                            increase in US power and influence, especially vis-a-vis the
                            food-deficit poor countries. Indeed, in times of shortage, the US will
                            face difficult choices about how to allocate its surplus between
                            affluent purchasers and the hungry world.</p>
                        <p>The implications for the world food situation and for US interests would
                            be considerably greater if climatologists who believe a cooling trend is
                            underway prove to be right.</p>
                        <p>If the trend continues for several decades there would almost certainly
                            be an absolute shortage of food. The high-latitude areas, including the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and north China, would
                            experience shorter growing seasons and a drop in output. The monsoon-fed
                            lands in Asia and Africa would also be adversely affected.</p>
                        <p>US production would probably not be hurt much. As custodian of the bulk
                            of the world's exportable grain, the US might regain the primacy in
                            world affairs it held in the immediate post-World War II era.</p>
                        <p>In the worst case, if climate change caused grave shortages of food
                            despite US exports, the potential risks to the US would also rise. There
                            would be increasingly desperate attempts on the part of powerful but
                            hungry nations to get grain any way they could. Massive migrations,
                            sometimes backed by force, would become a live issue and political and
                            economic instability would be widespread.</p>
                        <p>In the poor and powerless areas, population would have to drop to levels
                            that could be supported. The population "problem" would have solved
                            itself in the most unpleasant fashion.</p>

                        <p>Issues for Your Staff Meeting on the World Food Conference Monday - 3:00
                            p.m.</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>When you called for a world food conference at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> regular session a year ago, world
                            food stocks were declining toward minimum levels, prices were rising,
                            and the US had added to the climate of uncertainty by experimenting with
                            export controls on soybeans. There followed a gradual relaxation of
                            concern as consumption levels were sustained through 1973 and into 1974,
                            prices declined somewhat, and the world production outlook appeared
                            encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The crisis, however, did not pass. The projection of a poor US feedgrain
                            crop has reduced world production estimates by around 5 per cent at a
                            time when there are no reserve supplies. The main distinction between
                            the present situation and a year ago is that it is primarily feed for
                            animals producing meat and dairy products -- not food for direct human
                            consumption -- that is in short supply, though prices for both are
                            increasing. Thus, those directly affected are the affluent rather than,
                            for the moment, the poor. Nevertheless, there is again great concern and
                            a sense of urgency about the need for ensuring an adequate world food
                            supply. It is in this atmosphere that the World Food Conference will
                            open on November 5 -- with the rest of the world looking to the US, as
                            the prime exporter of basic foods, for leadership.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES</p>
                        <p>Major Food Conference issues fall under two broad headings -- World Food
                            Security and Food Aid.</p>
                        <p>A. World Food Security. There is general interest in establishing a
                            reserve food stocks system to ensure against famine because of
                            widespread crop failures. The developing countries have a particular
                            interest in securing increased development assistance for their
                            agricultural sectors so that they will be less vulnerable to bearing the
                            brunt of world food shortages when these develop.</p>
                        <p>--A Food Reserve System. There is widespread international agreement in
                            principle to <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> Director General
                            Boerma's proposal for international coordination of national stocks
                            policies. However, neither the USSR nor the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> have declared their position. Because it is the largest
                            single variable in the world grain supply picture, participation by the
                            USSR is essential to any workable stocks scheme. PRC participation is
                            highly desirable but not essential. To gain Soviet participation, a
                            stocks scheme must have sufficient attractions (preferential access to
                            reserves in times of shortage); penalties (payment of premium prices);
                            and general participation to make self-imposed exclusion onerous.</p>
                        <p>Issue: How far are we prepared to go in limiting access to US food
                            supplies to the USSR, in favor of commitments to a world reserve scheme,
                            in times of short supply? And could a sanction scheme (such as selective
                            export taxes) he workable?</p>
                        <p>The terms under which the US would participate in a food reserve scheme
                            are still undecided within the Government. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> remains opposed to US Government
                            owned stocks – except possibly, a small (2 million ton) grain reserve
                            for emergency food relief, while the probable level of stockholding for
                            the US in an effective scheme is in the range of 15-20 million tons.
                            Meanwhile, work is continuing under <gloss target="#t_CIEP1"
                                >CIEP</gloss>/CEA on defining a US position on the world stock
                            requirement and how carrying needed stocks might be shared among
                            exporters and importers. The US has a strong interest in sharing the
                            burden of carrying stocks, and needs to put forward an outline for a
                            workable scheme. </p>
                        <p>Issue: How can we get agreement within the Government on principles for a
                            stocks scheme that would commit us to an international coordinating
                            mechanism while leaving aside the secondary issue of the internal means
                            we may use to meet our obligation?</p>
                        <p>--Funding Agricultural Development. There are several proposals for new
                            international funds for agricultural development. Conference Secretary
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MSA1">Marei</persName> is preparing to
                            sponsor a proposal that would combine these. Part of his approach rests
                            on accommodating the interest of the oil exporters in greater control
                            over funds they might contribute in exchange for a commitment of their
                            participation.</p>
                        <p>We will be faced with having to decide on whether and to what extent we
                            will participate. A fund for agriculture without US financial, technical
                            and management resources would have greatly reduced effectiveness.
                            Moreover, the fundamental solution to the world food problem --
                            especially for most LDCs -- is increased production. We should, however,
                            decide in the context of the <gloss target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss> on
                            trade arrangements that will assure markets for increased
                            production.</p>
                        <p>Issue: Under what conditions are we prepared to deviate from our
                            opposition to the proliferation of international funds and endorse
                            special financing arrangements for agriculture? </p>
                        <p>B. Food Aid. Historically, the US has treated food aid as a surplus
                            disposal mechanism -- the quantity of food to be exported concessionally
                            or given away, to move US surplus production, after domestic and
                            commercial export needs have been met. The massive grain surpluses we
                            accumulated in the 1950s and 60s permitted food aid to be used freely
                            for political, economic development and relief purposes. The
                            disappearance of these surpluses and the pro-cyclical nature of our food
                            aid policy has left us unable to fulfill our assistance commitments and
                            left relief recipients uncertain about whether their minimum needs can
                            be met. A more certain basis for food aid will be a major issue at the
                            World Food Conference.</p>
                        <p>--The Problem for This Year. The absolute limits to our food program for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 are being dictated by
                            weather. A second important constraint is fiscal policy and the
                            availability of funding above the original $891 million budget level. In
                            light of Secretary Butz’ comments to you on Friday, we may end up with
                            commodity availabilities around 5.2 million tons -- as compared with 3.8
                            million tons in FY74 and the 7.7 million ton level at which we were
                            aiming only a few months ago for FY75. Such a program would cost-out
                            around $1.5 billion -- as compared with our FY74 expenditure of $1.0
                            billion. In short, we could have a commodity increase of about one-third
                            requiring a budget increase of one-half.</p>
                        <p>Issue: A request now for a $600 million increase in the FY75 budget for
                            PL 480 would meet with strong opposition by <gloss target="#t_OMB1"
                                >OMB</gloss> and others. It also would fan market speculation and
                            impact on domestic prices. Delaying announcement of our food aid
                            intentions past the opening of the UNGA may be unavoidable, but we will
                            need to have a public program by the opening of the World Food
                            Conference. How can agreement best be obtained?</p>
                        <p>--The Longer Run. Putting our food aid on a counter cyclical basis, in
                            which programs can continue in spite of world production declines, is
                            necessary if we are to be credible in our commitments and able to meet
                            relief needs when they are greatest. Accomplishing this also requires a
                            Government commitment on food stocks.</p>
                        <p>The issues here and on stockpiling for world food security are
                            essentially the same.</p>
                        <p>US OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p>Our objective is to attack the long-run problem of providing an adequate
                            world food supply through international cooperation centered on the
                            productive capacity of US agriculture. Doing so will enhance our ability
                            to use our food production capability strategically.</p>
                        <p>Our specific objectives should be to get Conference agreement on:</p>
                        <p>1) The size of reserves that will give the world a reasonable degree of
                            protection from food production shortfalls;</p>
                        <p>2) A process and criteria for use in sharing the burden of holding
                            reserves among participating countries;</p>
                        <p>3) Guidelines in accumulating and dispersing reserves and when
                            consultations are to be held;</p>
                        <p>4) An information exchange system relating to the reserve program;</p>
                        <p>5) Cooperation in accelerating agricultural development both by providing
                            greater resources and market incentives;</p>
                        <p>6) Wider agreement on the level of food aid requirements. </p>
                        <p>YOUR ROLE</p>
                        <p>You should set the tone and provide direction for the Conference in an
                            opening statement on behalf of the US delegation in which you set forth
                            our objectives. Your statement should come fairly early in the
                            Conference when it will have the greatest attention and impact both
                            within the Conference hail and around the world. The statement should
                            convey the vision of a world able to cope with the fundamental problem
                            of obtaining a nourishing diet through an international approach in
                            which cooperation supplements competition and planning replaces mute
                            acceptance of what nature provides.</p>
                        <p>Your actual presence at the Conference need only be for your speech.</p>

                        <p>SUBJECT: Food Policy</p>
                        <p>The President: The purpose of this meeting is to decide on a food aid
                            policy. Various options are laid out in the Ash memo.</p>
                        <p>The low option is $700 million plus. It's the same dollar value as before
                            but a lower quantity because of the price rise.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: This is the outlay and to it is added reflow, freight,
                            etcetera. So the amounts total $800 million. Some of these, like tobacco
                            and rice, we can get at somewhat lower prices. The basic question ... I
                            am for the middle level. I think you should go higher than the dollar
                            level of before if you can find the money. There are enough conditions
                            to do it without strain.</p>
                        <p>The President: If we took Option C or B, what would be the impact on the
                            housewife?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: You can't reserve half a billion without having some
                            price impact. I can't say how much, but it would be mildly inflationary.
                            You would get the plaudits of the liberal press. My problem is I don't
                            have the money in my budget.</p>
                        <p>The President: Suppose we just said "an increase in" without
                            specifying.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: Little effect.</p>
                        <p>The President: Suppose we said "significant increase."</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: I wouldn't do that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARL1">Ash</persName>: You could end up with the
                            worst of both worlds. You would focus here on the increase, and
                            foreigners would see it is not an increase in quantity.</p>
                        <p>The President: Butz said in the case of wheat and rice prices, they would
                            be lower than last year.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: We supply 40% of the world's commercial rice.</p>
                        <p>The President: I don't understand your budget.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: I have the lower amounts budgeted. I just can't find an
                            extra $200 or $400 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: The Agriculture budget was vetoed for $150 million, and this
                            would add $250 million. You have adequate authorization to get the money
                            from wherever you want. It accumulates by up to $1.9 billion a year. And
                            you don't need to go to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The President: Where does it come from?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: It is an automatic supplemental — it goes up after the contract
                            is let.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: My budget now is in veto and I am negotiating. I can't
                            add $300 million and negotiate with the Committee Chairman. He doesn't
                            like this now.</p>
                        <p>The President: Let's think of a scenario which gives us a foreign policy
                            and humanitarian benefit. We could make a commitment for an increase,
                            unidentified. Then we commit on a quarterly basis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: In quantity, Options A and B represent a decrease.
                            This is one of the few weapons we have to deal with oil prices.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do the recipients deal with quantities, not dollars?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: I don't think the individual countries will make
                            that connection. The problem will be cutting countries which expect it.
                            I would rather cut for those who would be disappointed anyway and use it
                            for foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: I agree. There are countries that have been living for
                            years on Title II.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: Henry has a good chart which shows the impact which different
                            levels give.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: I don't give a damn about Bangladesh or humanitarian
                            grounds. I want it for foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: Can't you recognize that we have had a bad year but that
                            we will make every effort to make a commensurate effort with last
                            year?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: It is actually good, but it sounds bad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenspan: Why can't we say the crops aren't in yet and we don't
                            know?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: The President is scolding everyone at the United
                            Nations for being miserly on energy, and the less we say we'll do on
                            food, the less effect it has. We are trying to tell the Third World they
                            must be cooperative, and in turn we will try to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: What we really have to offer is food. The wheat and rice
                            crops are practically harvested.</p>
                        <p>The President: You will have a good feel by March of what kind of winter
                            wheat crop you will have. Can't we just go with the first two quarters
                            and defer the later quarters?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: At what rate will we actually be spending the money, aside from
                            what we say?</p>
                        <p>The President: In the speech, we have the idea that the oil producers
                            have an asset, and we have an asset. If we want them to cooperate, we
                            must reassure them in a strong way that we want to reciprocate. If it
                            worked, we could get some cost of living benefit.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: At Option 3, we could get enough with a few to get
                            the benefits you seek.</p>
                        <p>The President: India gets a substantial amount under Title II, without
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: But this is useful in weaning India away from the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenspan: A few words about the price outlook. There are risks, and
                            I recognize the important tradeoffs. Especially the oil thing. Anything
                            we can do is at least as important as budget restraint. When there are
                            small reserves, there is a strong impact of withdrawals on price.
                            Anticipation or unexpected withdrawals could get you a substantial price
                            reaction. People now are so sensitive to the situation now that I worry.
                            If we could hold things down by quarters, it would help. There is a
                            corn-wheat tradeoff and if the corn crop gets frost, there could be a
                            price reaction which could be blamed on PL-480.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: There are also those who want export controls.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: That undercuts you with the oil producers.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is that pressure higher or lower?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: I think the speech language is okay.</p>
                        <p>[The President reads it aloud.]</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: We should add that each country will determine how its
                            food reserves will be held. I think if you make a commitment to more
                            than double our assistance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: We can say "substantially increase."</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: Or, "we are prepared to harken -- or respond -- to
                            appeals for export controls." [After phrase about "deaf ear.”]</p>
                        <p>The President: I am bothered by the phrase "declining crop."</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: I would say "disappointing summer."</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: I would not give them this lever by letting them say
                            we couldn't do more anyway. We want to point out that the oil producers
                            are putting export controls and we are taking a cooperative
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>The President: If we do it quarter by quarter, we have options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: The question is at what rate we disburse — at the high- or
                            low-option rate. I recommend we disburse at a lower rate with the
                            prospect of increasing if we can.</p>
                        <p>The President: With the exception that for good foreign policy reasons,
                            we increase when we need it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: I would start at the higher rate. Some of these
                            countries will do things we don't like and we could cut them for that as
                            we would have to anyway. While the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is
                            going an, I would like to let them continue thinking that we are doing
                            something new, but we can tell them we don't necessarily guarantee it
                            for the year.</p>
                        <p>The President: Who makes the decision?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: We have an interagency system which does it under whatever
                            policy guidance exists. But we could make the decisions one by one
                            without an overall policy framework.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger: For example, we have to do something for India. If
                            we are to make a breakthrough, it is over the next three months. I would
                            like to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that they don't get much for
                            their investment, but these countries slip away.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: Why don't you keep as flexible as possible and we will
                            work to get the most possible. We do it quarter by quarter, but we agree
                            we need more in the budget. I will tighten up on the agencies to the
                            extent possible. But you will take a lot of heat.</p>
                        <p>The President: How does this compare with McGovern'?</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: McGovern had stacked hearings. His plan would give away
                            the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>The President: How about keeping them at the low levels at most. Lower
                            than the low options.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ash: We shouldn't publish any program or total. We will have to meet
                            again on specific decisions.</p>
                        <p>The President: I would like for the next meeting to know where we are in
                            the actual execution: What have we used, what we have left,
                            etcetera.</p>

                        <p>Kissinger: I have the speech text and I've made marginal comments. See if
                            you can get these comments out to those who need them in something less
                            than 10,000 copies circulated all over town. The speech is not going to
                            do the job. We should indicate what we are going to do, and then see
                            what can be done internationally. If something is worth doing, we should
                            do it well. If I give this speech, people's reaction will be almost
                            inaudible. We should set forth a philosophy, try to convince people, not
                            give an old-maidish lecture to others about what they should do. We
                            should set forth what we intend to do and why we ought to do it. My
                            experience is that something which looks bold today becomes generally
                            accepted within one year and is old-fashioned the year after. So if you
                            start with something mediocre, you are irrelevant within three months.
                            Don't worry about trying to sell it within the Government. It's no more
                            difficult to try to sell something bold. The same people will oppose it
                            with the same arguments. I'm willing to go after the backing within
                            Government once we know what we need. I'm not an expert on agriculture,
                            but that allows me to tell the experts when they object that I'm
                            ignorant on their technical details.</p>
                        <p>Campbell: The last few months shows that <gloss target="#t_USDA1"
                                >USDA</gloss> doesn't know much either. And the weather hasn't
                            helped.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I can provide political orientation and the standards and the
                            rest will follow. I have no real problem with the text as such, but can
                            we really say that "all countries have responsibilities", when we know
                            that Bangladesh and the Sahel can't do anything, and that some others
                            can do greater and still others lesser?</p>
                        <p>Morris: But these other countries have responsibilities to fulfill as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: But is it necessary to lecture on the subject? We don't have
                            to talk about responsibilities. We can say what the problem is and what
                            is needed to meet it. We should be less schoolmasterish. The speech
                            doesn't have any philosophical position behind it. It puts forth eight
                            propositions--and no policies. We should discuss things like Bangladesh
                            and the Sahel drought in relation to other food problems. What other
                            ideas are around and not in the speech? I personally believe that in
                            five years the food exporting countries will be working together. Even
                            though I know we have a philosophy against commodity agreements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ETO1">Enders</persName>: I'm not sure that your
                            speech should provide the vehicle for making this case. A public
                            presentation will draw fire.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Whose fire?</p>
                        <p>Enders: From the LDCs who will think that we are attempting to promote an
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> for food.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: What we would be saying is that if you cooperate, we won't
                            have to talk about food. We should say that what is needed is better
                            food production, more rational food distribution, a common approach to
                            these. The philosophy is to get things established first. The newspapers
                            keep saying that the oil policy has backfired. Well, they are wrong. The
                            Arabs are scared, and regardless of what they say in public they are
                            very conciliatory to me in meetings. I haven't asked them to lower
                            prices. But they know that as structures take form, they have got to
                            watch us. We should push for increasing food production and
                            rationalizing the approach of the food surplus countries.</p>
                        <p>Enders: How about the other non-exporters? One large problem is the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and another the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. And India is still another. These
                            cause the most fluctuations.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: How much food does India export?</p>
                        <p>Enders: India's fluctuations in production are a major part of the
                            problem. The Soviet Union is the other part. We might just want
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: What I would like is a clearer, more thoughtful and
                            humanitarian explanation of the problem. Break the solution down into
                            categories-production, distribution, etc., then production down into
                            exporters' production, importers' production, and then indicate the
                            degree of global response. From this the philosophy emerges, so I can
                            say that if you don't like our recommendations at least you agree with
                            our analysis of the problem. Can we then add an operational structure? I
                            assume that <persName corresp="#p_BEL1">Butz</persName> won't shoot me
                            down on this.</p>
                        <p>Campbell: No, I'm sure he'll work with you.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: He and I work very well together. The only problems that arise
                            are due to my ignorance. I don't want to blunder in technical areas. So
                            you should get together another draft. I don't like the eight-point
                            problem approach. The President's speech and mine at the U.N. General
                            Assembly complemented each other very well. We stated a philosophy there
                            and we can state it again in greater detail in Rome. On food aid, we
                            have to work with Butz. The President is prepared to go for the high
                            option.</p>
                        <p>Enders: Should we announce a large program at the Conference? And what
                            figures do we use? For one year? If we take account of the production of
                            the Soviets and India all the variables are removed. So we can make a
                            decision, but we'll have to bear in mind the costs, chiefly what the
                            market impact will be.</p>
                        <p>Campbell: Yes, it will certainly mean upward pressure on the market. The
                            October crop report about to come out won't show much change over
                            September, but it doesn't take into account the latest hard frosts, and
                            the November one will show a bigger drop.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: And the Conference begins on what date?</p>
                        <p>Enders: The fifth of November.</p>
                        <p>Campbell: The November report won't come out until afterwards, and we
                            can't make it earlier because there are very tight security arrangements
                            for producing it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: If we can't make an announcement at the Conference it isn't
                            that important. I'm not so concerned about getting a one-day headline
                            from an announcement as long as we operate at a high level. I don't
                            think we should give the volume figure anyway, because they'll just
                            compare that with 1973. What we should do in the speech is to show that
                            we are looking at food policy in a global perspective rather than a
                            local perspective. It should state our philosophy. Can we increase
                            scientific research?</p>
                        <p>Birnbaum: We've been doing a lot. We expect we can get a 100 per cent
                            increase in financing.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: The question is can we increase it. Say what we can do and
                            then call on others to do something. Is there some international
                            research effort?</p>
                        <p>Birnbaum: There are eight established centers throughout the world. We
                            are doubling funding for international actions.</p>
                        <p>Campbell: We have a lot of knowledge around right now which others
                            already are not utilizing. Things like inputs in fertilizers and fuel.
                            We should start on this first.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: So we could get a double effect. First from new research.
                            Second, from increasing application of existing research, of making
                            available what we already know. The idea that the Saudis can do to
                            fertilizer what they've done to oil and get into a monopoly position
                            doesn't fill me with enthusiasm. This could cause great problems further
                            down the line, just like what we did with the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss>. I think our country has an amazing ability to encourage
                            developments that can later bring about its own undoing. This is the
                            first time a major power has created a major competitor with such
                            enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>Enders: Europe didn't believe us when we said it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I’m all for the fertilizer thing, but let's not push it in
                            such a way that OPEC can dominate it.</p>
                        <p>Enders: Furthermore, nobody really knows whether we might have
                            over-investment now which can lead to over-production later.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Tell me about the World Food Authority. Why should we oppose
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Morris: It is too unwieldy an organization. It is an unnecessary cover
                            organization for efforts, covered by other arrangements, and could
                            become an umbrella for other unwanted projects. It would be impossible
                            to use it effectively.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Our proposal for a Consultative Group on aid to food
                            production under the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is not the
                            sort of concept that is likely to send me to the barricades.</p>
                        <p>Enders: Essentially there are three proposals under the World Food
                            Authority idea. The reserves negotiations, the food aid group, and an
                            aid fund. On the fund, we should say we have no objection to other
                            people starting one. The question is whether the three should be made
                            into a package of one. It's a fielder's choice, whether you need a
                            covering organization or not.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: First let’s see what has to be done. If this requires three
                            organizations, and someone wants to bring them together, then we should
                            look at it. I'm indifferent as to the outcome. But if I come up and
                            announce a consultative group--then everyone will know that nothing will
                            happen. I see two problems. What do we really believe? My speech can
                            help set U.S. government policy, and then others around town outside
                            this building will have to do something. The second thing is to create
                            the framework for the rest of the world. If we waffle on this, everyone
                            else will waffle. This means we emphasize research, distribution of
                            technology and distribution of food. I don’t know the answers and I
                            don't even know some of the questions. But I know Butz will cooperate on
                            filling these in. So give me a new draft on Monday evening so I'll have
                            a chance to read it, and we'll meet Tuesday morning. The draft doesn't
                            have to be polished. Then when I'm away you can work on another more
                            thoughtful version. I want you to push in the direction of explicitness
                            and philosophy. I don't want a statement of consensus. I want to hear
                            what's right, not what can be sold. Can my speech be moved to the
                            morning of the 6th? I know I'm now scheduled on the 5th, after the
                            opening ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>Enders: You're number one on the list of speakers which is already set.
                            There is some advantage to being first and setting the tone for the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I might be able to get there by noon. On the speech, we don't
                            have to announce all our eventual goals. Let's not get into the business
                            of putting pressure on others. If you have the organization first, then
                            that itself creates the pressures on others.</p>
                        <p>Enders: What do you think about the rest of the paper? The issue is
                            whether we should seek agreement of others in advance of the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Let's not drag the others into it. We should announce what we
                            intend to do and then approach the others after the Conference. Are you
                            talking just about major exporters?</p>
                        <p>Enders: No. The importers, too.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I see two phases here. First the major exporters rationalize
                            their own policy, then the exporters work something out with the
                            importers. Otherwise you get an exporter-consumer confrontation right at
                            the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Enders: No, I think for example that the U.S. and Japan can work out a
                            joint rationale. We need reliable customers and they need a reliable
                            source of supply. Reserves are a joint way of approaching this.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I think we can do that after the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Enders: It depends upon the timetable.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: If I authorize a major approach before the Conference, I might
                            just as well insert it in the New York Times a couple of days later.
                            After all, we're talking about twenty countries and the possibility of
                            leaks is enormous.</p>
                        <p>Enders: No, we're talking about a much smaller number. And we don't have
                            to do it right away, but just in the course of this month.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Just a few days in advance of the Conference? We don't have to
                            decide now. Let's wait until our meeting next Tuesday. When we get
                            closer to the Conference, I'll work on it. In the meantime, work on the
                            speech. There's no danger that I will give a speech that has gone
                            through less than 11 drafts.</p>
                        <p>Palmer: No, sir. We once had one that took only ten.</p>

                        <p>Butz: (Secretary enters room.) There's our roving Ambassador. I have been
                            seeing a lot of you on the front pages, and you can have it. But I must
                            say, my impression is that the press coverage has been favorable.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Thank you Earl. You know PL 480 is one of the main things
                            going for us in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Butz: My rooms are not bugged, are yours?</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: No they are not. There is no use bugging with guys like these
                            going to the press everyday.</p>
                        <p>Butz: On PL 480, let me say that our budget is in veto status. But we are
                            doing our best. We have $640 million programmed and we can use the
                            borrowing authority of <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>. Currently we
                            have $200 to $250 million available, I think, in addition to the
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: How much would that be in terms of quantity?</p>
                        <p>Butz: Well wheat is about $180 per ton; I am not quite sure what that
                            comes out to. We can look at it this way. USDA has around a billion
                            dollars budgeted. That’s about our middle option.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Then why does the President think that he has approved the
                            high option? </p>
                        <p>[Butz?]: That's about $1.3 billion.</p>
                        <p>With our borrowing authority, we can reach the middle option and that's
                            about $1 billion. Which means that we can postpone going to the Congress
                            for additional money until the next year.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: You know Earl, in the last meeting on this subject with the
                            President, you were the only one who knew what was going on. I had a
                            paper that did not cover all of the possibilities and as soon as we got
                            off any of the main points, I was lost.</p>
                        <p>[Butz?]: In the last paper we sent to the President you may remember that
                            we told him to reach the high commodity option would require adding
                            additional money to the budget.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, we are going to get it. We can use more for the Middle
                            East, but frankly not for India. I don't care what we tell India.</p>
                        <p>[Butz?]: On India I have told my people that we need to give you a
                            meaningful program and we have been talking in terms of 500,000 tons.
                            Now, yesterday I was talking to Rabot of the <gloss target="#t_EC1"
                                >EC</gloss> who said that the Europeans would grant India 300
                            thousand tons of wheat; selling an additional 700 thousand tons on
                            credit.</p>
                        <p>This seems to be a replacement for what the Soviets would have done.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Why is that?</p>
                        <p>[Butz?]: Because their crop has not been as large as expected.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I thought at times we had been talking about giving India a
                            million and a half tons. What would that mean for the Middle East?</p>
                        <p>Katz: We won't be giving India that much. They have bought a million tons
                            and we are budgeting for up to 500,000 tons for PL 480.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Earl, what does this mean as far as you are concerned?</p>
                        <p>Butz: We are still looking at it, but I think we can use our CCC
                            financing to get up to the middle option.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well I am leaving on Tuesday and I would like to know what we
                            are going to do for India.</p>
                        <p>Katz: The situation is now that 300 thousand tons of wheat has been
                            approved for the first half year.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Can we increase that?</p>
                        <p>Katz: Only by taking it from Sri Lanka, or Pakistan, or Bangladesh.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I don't think we could do that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JL3">Jonnes</persName>: We could use more
                            rice.</p>
                        <p>Butz: We should push as much rice as possible.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well I would like to know what we can do by Friday. I don't
                            want it to look as though I am going around the world trying to buy
                            people with food, so I don't want to make the announcement. I don't care
                            who makes the announcement, but it shouldn't be made by me. But in the
                            case of the Middle East it is different. There food is a very important
                            part of our strategy. Now, can we turn to the speech? Why can't I get
                            what I want in this speech? I want to he able to give a speech that has
                            a philosophy in it. What we have now is a good technical speech, but I
                            won’t be believed as an agricultural expert because I am not. This
                            speech starts off with problems and immediately goes into solutions.
                            Earl, you should be the one to talk about programs not me.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LW2">Lord</persName>: We have tried to take your
                            comments into account and we changed the beginning and ending of the
                            speech last night.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I have not seen that, but you ought to know what I want from
                            what I have been saying all of these weeks. Now Earl you may disagree,
                            but I want to use this Speech to go to the frontier of these issues and
                            use it to break bureaucratic deadlocks. I know from what happened
                            earlier this year in oil that when you come forward with something
                            really new it remains fresh for only a year at most and then it becomes
                            accepted. To hack around in well-defined areas, is just a waste of my
                            time. We can use this speech for a number of purposes. Earl if you want
                            to have anything on this subject decided by the President, we can use
                            the speech to get it done.</p>
                        <p>Butz: Yes I know what you mean; for example, we got some good material
                            into his speech last week.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Yes I realized that from the reaction of people when he
                            started to talk about peanuts. When that came up I thought people would
                            go to sleep, but instead they were enthusiastic.</p>
                        <p>Butz: Yes that is right. That was good. We were able to get something
                            done that we have been wanting to do for sometime. Would it be
                            appropriate for some of my people to have a hand now in your Speech? I
                            think I know the kind of thing you want. It would be a broad
                            philosophical statement. There is no need to get down to a lot of
                            details in this speech.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That's the idea. I am giving a speech today at the Alfred
                            Smith Dinner; I am trying to force into national awareness the need to
                            strengthen bonds between us and the developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Butz: I am giving a speech this week which has some of these kinds of
                            points in it. For example, I want to show how much the developing
                            countries could do by improving their yields and how we could help them
                            do it. Is this in the speech now?</p>
                        <p>Lord: Part of it is.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I have no problem with the technical part. What I want to do
                            is convince the political leadership of these countries that we mean it
                            when we call for cooperation. The statements the President and I have
                            made recently are beginning to have that kind of effect in the Middle
                            East. I think we are going to succeed with getting the oil producers to
                            cooperate on prices.</p>
                        <p>Butz: I would like to take a copy of the speech and give it to one of my
                            speech writers, and see what he can do with it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Well, can we go through it first, section by section? Are any
                            of these ideas new?</p>
                        <p>Butz: Well, we will have to move quickly because I must leave soon.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Let’s take another ten minutes to go through it.</p>
                        <p>Katz: I would like to begin by stating the premises in this speech. They
                            are that we can increase production to make more available to the world
                            and particularly the LDCs. We must do as much as possible, but this will
                            meet only part of the problem. The LDCs, too, must greatly increase
                            their production. The problem has two main aspects -- production and
                            food security.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That I understand, but I want to avoid the protestant
                            missionary approach. I don't want to preach at the conference. I want to
                            tell the LDCs what we producers will do and then tell the LDCs what they
                            must do.</p>
                        <p>Morris: That is what the speech does now.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: OK. I have not read all of it carefully. When I got to the
                            first part, I just threw up my hands. What I want you to do now is go
                            through it again putting in concrete things that we can do, just as we
                            did last year on oil when we took that mass of material and made it into
                            a program. We need to have some bench marks so that people will know
                            what needs to be done. Now what about using <gloss target="#t_SDR1"
                                >SDR</gloss> financing? Whose approval do we need?</p>
                        <p>Katz: There is a hang-up about using SDRs for aid. Treasury will have
                            some objections.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: OK, how do we get it done? When is <persName corresp="#p_SWE2"
                                >Simon</persName> coming back? Remember I have only four more
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Katz: Simon will be back tomorrow, and <persName corresp="#p_ETO1"
                                >Enders</persName> thinks that you should talk to him.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I don't think Enders has ever had such a good spokesman as me
                            before. What do you think (Jonnes)?</p>
                        <p>Jonnes: I think it is essential that we go ahead.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: I want to be sure that this is an adequate program, and not
                            just something that is bureaucratically safe.</p>
                        <p>Butz: Can we have a draft? I would like to have some of my people go over
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: Let me go over it again first. Who would you give it to?</p>
                        <p>Butz: <persName corresp="#p_GCW2">Claude Gifford</persName>. We will need
                            to take a look at it.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: OK.</p>
                        <p>Butz: I am going to be giving some interesting figures in a speech later
                            this week, showing that LDCs grain yields are lagging and that this is
                            where we can help.</p>
                        <p>Kissinger: That is the kind of thing I want. I don't want to give a
                            bureaucratic speech. Win, can you get in touch with Gifford today and
                            give me a new speech tomorrow? I will be able to devote tomorrow night
                            to looking at it. I know that in the end you are going to give me what I
                            want; why don't you just do it now?</p>
                        <p>Lord: We will get you a new speech by tomorrow evening.</p>

                        <p>FOOD, FERTILIZER, POPULATION</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND </p>
                        <p>A peaceful world requires adequate food. The world population is almost 4
                            billion, increased by about 76 million in 1973, and at current growth
                            rates (2%) will double in 35 years to 8 billion. With rising incomes
                            diets improve, further adding to demand.</p>
                        <p>A 4 percent decline in world food production in 1972 -- the first
                            absolute decline in 20 years -- triggered the present world food
                            problem. Harvests in 1973 were good, but production this year has again
                            been disappointing. World wheat and corn production in 1974 is down by
                            25 million tons.</p>
                        <p>World reserves are depleted. Food prices are at record or near-record
                            levels. Efforts to rebuild stocks are hampered by a world shortage of
                            nitrogenous fertilizer and high prices for all fertilizers. There is
                            some concern that the world's weather may be shifting unfavorably. The
                            drought across North-Central Africa and erratic monsoons in South Asia
                            are indicators.</p>
                        <p>These trends and coincidences have focused attention on the food problem.
                            At our initiative, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has scheduled a
                            World Food Conference for this November. A World Population Conference
                            was held in August.</p>
                        <p>The essential elements in a world food strategy, in which the US must
                            play a leading part, are:</p>
                        <p>-- Increase global food production to meet the needs of an expanding
                            global population.</p>
                        <p>-- To assure that we avoid past problems of large food surpluses which we
                            were unable to market at prices which would not discourage new
                            production, we need new ways to transfer real purchasing power to food
                            deficit developing countries where the need for food exceeds both global
                            production and effective demand.</p>
                        <p>-- Rebuild world food reserves to cover future bad crop failures and
                            mitigate their disruptive impact on our domestic and world commercial
                            markets.</p>
                        <p>-- Provide better mechanisms for food aid to improve nutritional
                            standards while retaining flexibility to use Title I-type food aid
                            transfers to support important US foreign policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>FOOD</p>
                        <p>US STRATEGY/THE SITUATION NOW</p>
                        <p>A key element in our strategy is maximizing production. We have removed
                            acreage restrictions. Had weather conditions been favorable, US
                            production this year of most major commodities would have been well
                            above previous records. The complementary priority is assistance to the
                            LDCs to increase their agricultural output. For <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>-75 we have requested $676 million of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funding for food and nutrition -- up
                            from $285 million planned in FY-74, and we must work with the new
                            Congress to get as much of this as possible.</p>
                        <p>At the World Food Conference in November we hope to achieve international
                            agreement on cooperative efforts to: (1) rebuild world food reserves;
                            (2) increase food production in both developed countries and the LDCs;
                            (3) provide food aid in emergency/disaster situations and (4) meet the
                            needs of countries lacking foreign exchange for essential food
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>We look to the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (<gloss target="#t_MTN1"
                                >MTN</gloss>) as the main forum for reforming world agricultural
                            trade to give increased commercial incentives for efficient production.
                            Preparatory work is under way and substantive negotiations can begin
                            when the Trade Bill is passed.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES AND CHOICES</p>
                        <p>World and US domestic consciousness of food shortages has been sharpened
                            over the past two years, affording us a unique opportunity to make a
                            potentially historic breakthrough for both the US farmer and our
                            international objectives. We seek to:</p>
                        <p>-- Maintain US agricultural output at maximum levels;</p>
                        <p>-- Organize close cooperation among the main food exporting
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>To sustain high levels of production without creating market depressing
                            surpluses we need international commitments from the main importers and
                            exporters to a new system of reserves (to be built up gradually) , and
                            from the rich countries as a whole (including the oil exporters) to
                            devise an effective method of transferring real purchasing power to food
                            deficit LDCs. The latter would both expand effective demand in LDCs and
                            act to maintain commercial prices at levels which, even if lower than
                            now, would still provide adequate incentive to farmers to maintain
                            maximum production.</p>
                        <p>The main issues with respect to an international system of reserves are
                            1) the formula by which reserve-holding responsibility is allocated, and
                            2) the role of the US Government in holding or guaranteeing the US
                            share. With respect to the transfer of purchasing power to the LDCs, the
                            traditional funding of foreign assistance is unlikely to provide the
                            level of resources required and we have not yet developed mechanisms for
                            recycling oil exporters’ financial surpluses to the LDCs on terms they
                            can afford or responsibilities that the <gloss target="#t_DCs1"
                                >DCs</gloss>, as intermediaries, are willing to accept. The resource
                            transfer problem as it relates to food must be worked out in the larger
                            context of international economic reform, in which world cooperation on
                            energy supplies is also an important element.</p>
                        <p>NEXT STEPS </p>
                        <p>-- Outline the above approach in a speech to the World Food Conference in
                            early November.</p>
                        <p>-- Following the Conference, begin negotiations with major importers and
                            exporters on an international food reserve system and, as required by
                            the progress of those negotiations, reach internal US Government
                            decisions on US participation including the issue of Government-held
                            stocks.</p>
                        <p>-- Define more precisely our trade negotiations strategy and objectives
                            in agriculture and integrate our food reserves strategy into them.</p>
                        <p>-- Early enactment of the FY-75 aid bill with increased assistance to
                            agricultural production in the LDCs.</p>
                        <p>-- Final decisions on allocating our FY-75 food aid, to be made not later
                            than the end of December.</p>
                        <p>FERTILIZER</p>
                        <p>US STRATEGY/THE SITUATION NOW </p>
                        <p>The present world shortage of nitrogenous fertilizer is the result of low
                            prices and little new plant construction in the late 60s and early 70s,
                            coupled with a sudden increase in demand. High prices will stimulate new
                            plant construction but there will be a 3-4 year time-lag. Since natural
                            gas is the basic feedstock for nitrogenous fertilizer, the oil exporting
                            countries are logical sites for these plants. The US has offered to
                            provide technical assistance.</p>
                        <p>US strategy in the short run is to assist LDCs to make full use of their
                            existing capacity and to take such steps as are possible to see they
                            receive a fair share of world supply, 85 percent of which is produced in
                            the DCs. The US is coordinating its bilateral efforts with the
                            fertilizer assistance pool established by the Food and Agriculture
                            Organization (<gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The third element of US strategy is to promote research into new
                            fertilizers and their application, with particular reference to LDCs.
                            AID planning and support for a World Fertilizer Institute is well
                            along.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES AND CHOICES</p>
                        <p>The negative effect of fertilizer shortage on LDCs is considerably
                            greater than on DCs, where application rates are high. In the LDCs one
                            ton of fertilizer can add up to ten tons to food Production. But there
                            is strong domestic political pressure to be sure US fertilizer needs are
                            met before exports to the LDCs are increased. The fertilizer industry
                            wants to avoid export controls. Despite official encouragement, there
                            has been inadequate response to recent AID tenders for fertilizer
                            shipments to LDCs.</p>
                        <p>Except for potash imports from Canada the US is a marginal net exporter
                            of fertilizer. Much of the new capacity for nitrogenous fertilizer will
                            be built near natural gas sources outside the US--such as the Middle
                            East. The US may become dependent on foreign supply. We will need to
                            manage and diversify our fertilizer dependence carefully to remain a
                            reliable food supplier.</p>
                        <p>NEXT STEPS </p>
                        <p>AID programs to maximize production from existing fertilizer capacity in
                            the LDCs, to provide technical assistance for constructing new plants,
                            and to expand world fertilizer research are underway.</p>
                        <p>POPULATION</p>
                        <p>US STRATEGY/THE SITUATION NOW</p>
                        <p>Population growth is a world problem. But the solutions and most of the
                            effort must be national. US strategy seeks expanding awareness of the
                            population problem and commitment to effective action by national
                            leaders. We strongly supported the work of the World Population
                            Conference and pushed for a World Population Plan of Action calling for
                            decreased birth rate targets which might enable the world to achieve
                            population stability by 2050 at about 8.2 billion. Though a plan was
                            adopted, it is less than we would have preferred.</p>
                        <p>Countries with some 75 percent of the world's population now accept
                            population control efforts. However, even among countries which have
                            severe population pressures the effort is highly uneven, and many
                            countries including Brazil, Argentina, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Poland and Hungary in fact remain
                            opposed. The built-in momentum of population growth inherent in the
                            young, age structure of rapidly growing countries is imperfectly
                            understood. Thus in many countries there is incomplete intellectual and
                            political commitment to population control efforts by governments and
                            political elites.</p>
                        <p>In the past nine years the US has provided over $600 million of
                            population planning assistance. US strategy is to mount bilateral
                            programs as requested by host governments (36 to date), and to work
                            through multilateral and private organizations elsewhere. Supported
                            activities include demographic data collection and analysis, research in
                            factors affecting fertility behavior and control techniques, the
                            provision of family planning services and information and manpower
                            training.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES AND CHOICES</p>
                        <p>Efforts to promote family planning must be pursued by the US in a broad
                            multilateral framework, which makes clear that the US is contributing
                            its share to a program supported by a substantial segment of the world
                            community. Within this context, the issue is how US diplomatic missions
                            can most effectively promote a better appreciation of the population
                            problem in contacts with governments and national elites.</p>
                        <p>NEXT STEPS</p>
                        <p>Interest generated at Bucharest should be translated into more aggressive
                            government and private programs. Basically, the US needs to encourage
                            this trend by being prepared to do more of what it has done for the past
                            nine years. The AID budget in support of population activities in FY-74
                            was $112 million. We are proposing $137.5 million for this year.</p>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT<lb/>FROM: ROY L. ASH</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT: Food Aid Issues Raised by the World Food Conference </p>
                        <p>As expected, the World Food Conference has increased the visibility of
                            the food aid issue in the U.S. and abroad. In Rome, there is movement
                            toward the long sought after U.S. goal of encouraging other developed
                            countries to share in the food aid burden, especially in the next
                            several critical months until a new crop can be harvested.</p>
                        <p>However, the U.S. decision not to commit now to providing more food aid
                            in the short term will be interpreted by many as a failure "to do
                            everything humanly possible to assure that our future contribution will
                            be responsive to the growing needs." Standing alone, this well
                            publicized decision will leave the U.S. open to mounting criticism as
                            the consequences of increasingly severe food shortages abroad become
                            apparent over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this outcome, the U.S. should act, even while the World Food
                            Conference continues, to provide positive leadership to enhance the
                            desirable momentum toward more burden-sharing that is developing in
                            Rome, while at the same time not ending up paying a disproportionate
                            amount of the bill. Particularly, we should try to assure that the short
                            term U.S. and world crop situation does not undermine attempts to
                            develop solid longer term solutions to the world food problem.</p>
                        <p>To provide this positive leadership now and in the weeks immediately
                            ahead, the U.S. must provide answers to the following questions:</p>
                        <p>1. Given the U.S. decision not to provide additional food aid at this
                            time, what can the U.S. do now to help maintain the momentum toward
                            other developed countries contributing more food aid in the next several
                            months?</p>
                        <p>2. What can be done to make Secretary Kissinger's commitment -- that the
                            U.S. will do "everything humanly possible" to help feed the starving and
                            the hungry -- credible for Americans and other nations?</p>
                        <p>3. What can the U.S. do to assure Americans and other countries that the
                            pressures created by today's food shortages have not caused us to shrink
                            from accepting a responsible leadership role in helping develop
                            solutions for the longer term world food problem?</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION </p>
                        <p>That you ask the International Food Review Group to consider the above
                            issues and, at the earliest possible time, to recommend actions that the
                            U.S. should take at the World Food Conference, and in the weeks
                            immediately following the Conference, to provide positive leadership on
                            the world food issue within the limits of our responsibility and the
                            resources we are willing to make available for such an effort.</p>

                        <p>The President has directed that an International Food Review Group,
                            comprising the addressees of this memorandum, be established to
                            coordinate the implementation of United States' decisions and
                            initiatives stemming from the World Food Conference. It should, as
                            appropriate, make recommendations on further actions to be taken to
                            implement the measures announced at the Conference. The Secretary of
                            State and the Secretary of Agriculture are to be Chairman and Vice
                            Chairman respectively.</p>
                        <p>The Group should coordinate its recommendations, as they relate to U.S.
                            agriculture and trade policy, with the Executive Committee of the
                            President's Economic Policy Board.</p>
                        <p>The International Food Review Group should create a working group chaired
                            by the representative of the Secretary of State with the representative
                            of the Secretary of Agriculture as Vice Chairman. Other members of the
                            working group should include representatives of the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the
                            Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Executive

                            agencies as appropriate. The working group should coordinate its
                            activities with U.S. Government efforts in multilateral trade

                            TASKS AGREED TO AT WFC. IN OUR VIEW, MOST DIRECT MEANS OF MAINTAINING
                            MOMENTUM AND CARRYING FORWARD WORK OF WFC IS FOR UNGA TO ADOPT

                            ADDRESSED IN WFC RESOLUTIONS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO

                        <p>C. WE BELIEVE IT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ENDORSE WFC RESULTS AS A WHOLE.
                            IN ANY LARGE AND COMPLEX NEGOTIATION THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME ASPECTS
                            WHICH ONE PARTICIPANT OR ANOTHER FEELS COULD BE IMPROVED. THIS MOST

                            BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OVER-ALL RESULTS OF WFC ARE SO POSITIVE AND
                            CONSTRUCTIVE THAT COMMON INTEREST OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTS THEIR FULL
                            ENDORSEMENT. WE URGE THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTS, TAKING BROAD VIEW OF THE
                            COMMON INTEREST, JOIN WITH US IN PROMOTING PROMPTEST POSSIBLE FOLLOW-ON
                            WORK BY ENDORSING WFC AS A WHOLE. </p>

                        <p>November 5-16, 1974</p>

                        <p>WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE<lb/>Rome, Italy<lb/>November 5-16, 1974</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>In September 1973, in his first speech before the United Nations after
                            becoming Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger asked that a World Food
                            Conference be organized under U.N. auspices in 1974 to discuss ways to
                            maintain adequate food supplies and to concentrate the efforts of all
                            nations to meet the hunger resulting from natural disasters. He further
                            asked that nations in a position to do so offer technical assistance in
                            the conservation of food and said that the U.S. was ready to join with
                            others in providing such assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary's recommendation was endorsed by the biennial <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> Meeting held in Rome shortly
                            thereafter, and in December, 'the United Nations' General Assembly
                            formally adopted a resolution calling for a World Food Conference of
                            member governments of the U.N.</p>
                        <p>A Preparatory Committee open to all member states of the United Nations
                            was set up to lay the groundwork for the Conference. The Committee met
                            three times. At the first meeting in New York, February 11 to 15,
                            procedural arrangements for the Conference were discussed. At the second
                            meeting held in Geneva, June 4 to 8, the discussions centered on a
                            review and critical analysis of the Secretariat assessment of the
                            current world food situation and prospects for the future. A provisional
                            agenda for the Conference was then agreed upon. The third meeting in
                            Rome, September 23 to October 4, was devoted entirely to substantive
                            discussion of the main issues to be addressed at the Conference. This
                            third meeting was preceded by an informal working group meeting,
                            September 16 to 20, which reviewed various proposals put forward by the
                            Secretariat and some participating governments for international
                            agricultural development funds and other follow-up mechanisms, as well
                            as a declaration on the Eradication of Hunger, introduced by Peru. As a
                            result of the third meeting, a set of ten draft resolutions
                            incorporating the themes considered to be of central importance to the
                            Conference was prepared by the Secretariat, and distributed with the
                            understanding that it would serve as a basis for discussion at the
                            Conference. The ten resolutions contain a synthesis of some 88
                            recommendations originally made by the Secretariat in its document "The
                            World Food Problem, Proposals for Rational and International Action"
                            (E/Conf. 65/4). It was generally felt that such a large number of
                            recommendations on quite diverse topics would prove an unwieldy
                            instrument for obtaining results at the Conference. The Secretariat also
                            presented a new draft Declaration considerably revising the original
                            Peruvian proposal, taking into consideration the comments made on that
                            proposal during the working group meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Preparatory Committee's work overall was extremely useful in setting
                            the tone for the Conference and in reducing issues to manageable
                            proportions. Meetings were marked by a degree of seriousness and a
                            conciliatory attitude on the part of most participants, offering
                            considerable hope for a constructive and successful Conference.</p>

                        <p>With the exception of work on the Declaration, which was handled by a

                        <p>Resolution I - Objectives and Strategies of Food Production</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation basically supported the Secretariat resolution but
                            made several recommendations to broaden its scope and increase the sense
                            of urgency conveyed.</p>
                        <p>A number of delegates welcomed the U.S. proposal to incorporate Secretary
                            Kissinger's appeal that all governments accept the goal "that within a
                            decade no child will go to bed hungry, that no family will fear for its
                            next day's bread, and that no human being's future and capacities will
                            be stunted by malnutrition." The U.S. also proposed (1) taking into
                            account environmental concerns; (2) emphasizing that technology
                            transferred to <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s should be
                            appropriate and adapted to their special needs; and (3) urging
                            governments of exporting countries to encourage the early expansion of
                            food production; and (4) recognizing the problem of waste and the need
                            for improved marketing, storage and distribution systems.</p>
                        <p>The substance of all the U.S. recommendations were incorporated in the
                            final version.</p>
                        <p>A good deal of debate arose from an Algerian proposal to handle agenda
                            item 9(b), "measures for increasing food production in developed
                            countries," as a separate resolution. Eventually, it was agreed that
                            recognition of the need to increase food production in certain developed
                            countries should be incorporated in the resolution under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Resolution II - Priorities for Agricultural and Rural Development</p>
                        <p>While there was full agreement on the basic importance of accelerated
                            growth of food production, it was generally recognized that this could
                            not be achieved through application of capital and technology alone, but
                            also called for increasing the participation of the rural population,
                            especially small farmers and landless rural laborers and their families.
                            There was therefore general agreement that far-reaching socio-economic
                            reforms are urgently required in many developing countries.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation recommended that the important role played by women
                            in food production be recognized, as did several other delegations. This
                            recommendation was incorporated in the Resolution.</p>
                        <p>A number of other amendments were also proposed and adopted, including
                            the need for providing rural families with education, health and other
                            services.</p>
                        <p>Resolution III - Fertilizers</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation generally supported the Secretariat resolutions. At
                            the U.S. suggestion, an amendment was adopted which requested nations to
                            call upon their citizens voluntarily to reduce non-critical uses of
                            fertilizer toward making available more fertilizer for food production
                            in developing countries.</p>
                        <p>A few other amendments to the Secretariat draft were adopted including a
                            request to the FAO Commission on Fertilizers to undertake an analysis of
                            the long-term supply and demand situation to provide policy aimed at
                            avoiding cyclical imbalances between supply and demand.</p>
                        <p>Resolution IV - Food and Agricultural Research, Extension and
                            Training</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation recommended changes in the proposed resolution which
                            recognized the need: (1) to protect environmental quality; (2) to
                            develop appropriate technology with special concern for small farmers;
                            and (3) to encourage more effective linkages between national and
                            international research centers and farmers. All these suggestions were
                            adequately reflected in the final draft.</p>
                        <p>Most delegations emphasized the need to combine research with active
                            extension and educational services to translate research into action.
                            These emphases were incorporated into the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Resolution V - Policies and Programs to Improve Nutrition</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation supported the draft resolution on nutrition but
                            offered a number of additions to strengthen the resolution and a few
                            modifications.</p>
                        <p>First, the U.S. strongly supported the portion of the resolution calling
                            on governments to adopt food and nutrition plans as part of their
                            national planning. To strengthen this proposal, the U.S. recommended
                            that the international agencies concerned prepare a project proposal for
                            assisting governments to develop inter-sectoral nutrition plans and
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. also proposed the incorporation of Secretary Kissinger's
                            initiatives: (1) to establish a global nutrition surveillance system;
                            (2) to arrange for an internationally coordinated program of applied
                            nutrition research; and (3) to establish a world-wide control program
                            aimed at reducing vitamin A and iron deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. also proposed a number of modifications in the sections on child
                            feeding. The purpose of these modifications was to emphasize the need
                            for developing comprehensive nutrition programs and weighing the costs
                            and benefits of child feeding in this context.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement among the delegates that the emphasis on
                            child feeding in the Secretariat draft should be modified and that
                            specific targets should not be established for child feeding. All the
                            U.S. interventions were accepted in substance. The Nordic delegations
                            played an active role and emphasized the problem of over-consumption
                            among the affluent.</p>
                        <p>Resolution XIII - The International Fund for Agricultural Development</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the resolution proposing the
                            establishment of an International Fund for Agricultural Development. The
                            proposal was sponsored by 34 nations, primarily from the group of 77,
                            but including Australia, Netherlands and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>The Committee agreed that there was an urgent need for a substantial
                            increase in the flow of assistance to agriculture in developing
                            countries, to help them to bring about the required increase in food
                            production and to speed up their agricultural development. The Committee
                            therefore welcomed warmly the proposal made by a number of countries to
                            establish an International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>
                        <p>The Committee stressed that the contributions to the Fund, which would be
                            voluntary, should be additional to aid and investment funds already
                            flowing to agriculture.</p>
                        <p>There was agreement that the Fund would not become operational until the
                            Secretary-General of the United Nations determined that the Fund held
                            promise of generating substantial additional resources and had a
                            reasonable prospect of continuity.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation welcomed the Fund proposal and recommended that
                            disbursements from the Fund be handled through bilateral as well as
                            regional and multilateral institutions. The U.S. also noted that a
                            number of points about the operation of the Fund will need to be
                            clarified.</p>
                        <p>Other Resolutions</p>
                        <p>The intention of the Secretariat had been to focus attention on the first
                            five major resolutions prepared by the Secretariat. The U.S. generally
                            supported this objective.</p>
                        <p>However, a number of delegations felt strongly that additional
                            resolutions were needed on such topics as a world soil charter, water
                            management, the seed industry and other aspects of agricultural
                            development. Since the objectives sought in these resolutions were
                            laudable, the U.S. acquiesced in the passage of these additional
                            resolutions. In fact, the U.S. spoke in favor of resolutions on women
                            and food, and on population and food supply.</p>
                        <p>Two resolutions were introduced of primarily a political nature: (1)
                            reduction of military expenditures for increasing food production, and
                            (2) national and international programs of action for food aid to
                            victims of colonial wars in Africa. The U.S. delegation spoke against
                            both resolutions as being inappropriate for the <gloss target="#t_WFC1">
                                WFC</gloss> to adopt. However, they were accepted by the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>Declaration on Hunger</p>
                        <p>The drafting group of the First Committee charged with preparing the
                            Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger was as follows: Sweden
                            (rapporteur), Algeria, Brazil (substituting occasionally for Mexico),
                            Congo, Cuba, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Kenya, Mexico, Peru,
                            The People's Republic of China, The Soviet Union, Switzerland, United
                            States of America, United Kingdom, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. The Soviet
                            and Cuban delegations were represented at high levels, demonstrating the
                            importance they attached to the Declaration.</p>
                        <p>At the first drafting session, Peru proposed that only the original
                            Peruvian draft declaration be considered as the basic text from which a
                            new draft would be developed. Peru argued that its draft had not been
                            properly discussed at the Third meeting of the Preparatory Committee.
                            This recommendation was supported by <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>, Yugoslavia, the USSR, Romania, <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> and Cuba. No other countries spoke, except Group B
                            members (U.S., U.K., Switzerland) all of whom opposed the suggestion,
                            noting that the Peruvian draft had been thoroughly discussed in the
                            Third PrepCom as well as at the one week informal Working Group which
                            preceded it. The USA noted that the Secretariat draft was the result of
                            those deliberations and that to return to the Peruvian draft would mean
                            ploughing the same ground again.</p>
                        <p>As a compromise, the rapporteur suggested that the agenda of the WFC be
                            the "skeleton" around which the Declaration would be built, using both
                            the Peruvian and the Secretariat drafts. This proposal was discussed by
                            Group B and it was decided to proceed as suggested by the rapporteur.
                            Peru, Algeria and the Socialist countries dominated the drafting
                            sessions, determined to make the Declaration the major vehicle for
                            expression of their views.</p>
                        <p>The tactics of Peru seemed to be to draw on the most militant members of
                            the Group of 77 by switching participation in drafting sessions.
                            Yugoslavia substituted for Indonesia, Algeria for Dahomey, Kenya and the
                            Congo did not attend sessions. Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela had little
                            to say.</p>
                        <p>Algeria and Peru attempted in the preambular part of the Declaration to
                            establish that the food problem in the developing countries was due to
                            past economic and social injustices and with the help of Yugoslavia
                            attempted to cite past <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions to
                            support their contention. In the operative part of the Declaration, they
                            tried to call for restitution from developed countries for these past
                            injustices. Socialists invariably gave support, others were silent,
                            leaving <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, USA and Switzerland
                            representatives to carry the full debate against these tactics.</p>
                        <p>Group B representatives were successful in getting a number of
                            constructive amendments into the Declaration, in softening the harshness
                            of Peruvian and. Algerian proposals, and in a limited number of cases
                            were able to obtain withdrawal of all or parts of the Algerian and
                            Peruvian proposals. The Declaration as presented by the drafting group
                            was accepted by Committee I.</p>
                        <p>Committee II</p>
                        <p>The Second Committee dealt with agenda item 9(d), the strengthening of
                            world food security. Of the ten draft resolutions recommended to the
                            Conference by the third session of its preparatory committee, three were
                            assigned to Committee II. These were on:</p>
                        <p>-- an information system for food and agriculture, </p>
                        <p>-- world food security.</p>
                        <p>-- food aid policy.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the Committee was assigned responsibility for developing a
                            resolution on follow-up action.</p>
                        <p>The Committee was delayed by about one day in beginning its work because
                            of difficulty over the selection of conference officers. The Committee
                            first met late on November 6. It adopted a program of work under which
                            the full Committee debated each of the draft resolutions before
                            referring them to working groups for revision and referral back to the
                            Committee. Representation in these working groups was open to all
                            delegations, and the United States participated actively in each.</p>
                        <p>Conference follow-up was handled separately by referring preparation of a
                            draft resolution to a distinct working group for which representatives
                            were delegated by blocs. These represented the developed countries
                            (Group B), the developing countries (Group of 77), the Socialist block,
                            and the People's Republic of China. The United States, along with the
                            United Kingdom, represented the developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Approximately eighty delegations regularly took part in meetings of the
                            full Committee, but only about twenty in the working groups discussing
                            resolutions apart from follow-up. These working groups completed their
                            tasks and reported agreed drafts back to the Committee on November 13
                            and 14. The Committee completed its review on November 15, and the texts
                            it recommended to the Conference plenary were adopted by acclamation.
                            However, the People's Republic of China formally reserved its position
                            on the resolutions on a food information system and on world food
                            security -- both in the Committee and in the Conference plenary -- on
                            grounds that obligations under these resolutions could infringe national
                            sovereignty. It was joined in this reservation in plenary by the
                            People's Republic of Albania.</p>
                        <p>As adopted, the three resolutions conform to the positions approved for
                            the U.S. Delegation and respond to the initiatives announced in
                            Secretary Kissinger's speech at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>-- The resolution on a food and agriculture information system responds
                            to the need for more timely and precise information on world food
                            supplies, crop conditions, weather and the cost of production inputs.
                            The principle responsibility for developing and implementing this system
                            was assigned to the FAO.</p>
                        <p>-- The resolution on world food security endorsed the objectives,
                            policies and guidelines of the draft Undertaking on World Food Security,
                            initially proposed by FAO Director-General Boerma, and recognized the
                            special responsibility of major exporting and importing countries to
                            take the lead in implementing these principles. It also urged donor
                            countries and institutions to assist developing countries with
                            implementing appropriate national stock policies.</p>
                        <p>-- The resolution on food aid policy advocated forward planning of food
                            aid and recommended an annual global target of 10 million tons of
                            grains. It requested all potential donors to give urgent consideration
                            to food aid needs for 1975 and 1976. It also advocated a greater
                            proportion of food be made available through multilateral channels, such
                            as the World Food Program, and on a grant rather than on a loan
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Committee III</p>
                        <p>The Third Committee dealt with agenda item 9(e), "National and
                            International Action Programs: Specific objectives and measures in the
                            area of international trade and adjustment which are relevant to the
                            food problem, including measures toward stabilization, and expansion of
                            markets for exports from developing countries."</p>
                        <p>The Committee had as the basis for its discussion two draft resolutions
                            prepared by the Secretariat for the World Food Conference which took
                            into account the various views expressed by delegations at the
                            Preparatory Committee meetings which preceded the World Food Conference.
                            It also had before it a draft resolution proposed by the Yugoslav
                            delegation. However, early in the Committee's deliberation, Mexico, on
                            behalf of the Group of 77, submitted a new draft resolution which the
                            developing countries wanted to use as the basis for discussion. With the
                            introduction of this resolution, Yugoslavia withdrew its draft
                            resolution. The developed countries, on the other hand, preferred the
                            Secretariat's drafts since they reflected the previous extensive
                            discussions on the subject matter, and constituted an attempt at
                            compromising the divergent views. Moreover, the instructions which
                            delegations brought with them from their capitals we based primarily on
                            the Secretariat's draft resolutions.</p>
                        <p>The sharp and divisive debate on the substance of the issues before the
                            Committee led to the establishment of a Contact Group of 14 members --
                            Algeria, Argentina, Cuba, India, Nigeria and Yugoslavia representing the
                            Group of 77; Australia, France, Japan, Sweden and the United States
                            representing the Group B countries; Poland and the USSR representing the
                            Socialist countries; and China. The representative from Indonesia, Mr.
                            A. Ismet Hakim was elected Chairman of the Contact Group. Since other
                            members of the Committee expressed a great interest in the subject
                            matter, it was decided that any other member of the Committee could
                            participate in the Contact Group if they wished.</p>
                        <p>The Contact Group used, as the basis for discussion, the resolutions
                            prepared by the Secretariat and the newly introduced resolution
                            submitted by the Mexican delegation. The divergence of views was so
                            great, however, that no significant progress could be made in agreeing
                            on a resolution which could be approved by consensus. The developing
                            countries insisted on using the language and paragraphs of the Mexican
                            draft resolution while the developed countries called attention to the
                            various difficulties presented by the operative paragraphs of the
                            Mexican draft. The Contact Group, therefore, established a small
                            Drafting Committee consisting of 3 representatives from Group B --
                            Australia, France and the United States; 3 representatives from the
                            Group of 77 -- Algeria, Argentina and India; and 1 representative from
                            the Socialist countries -- Poland. This drafting committee met under the
                            chairmanship of Mr. Hakim of Indonesia, and after two days and one night
                            of intensive negotiation, succeeded in reaching agreement on a draft
                            resolution. On November 15, the Committee adopted the draft resolution
                            without a vote and recommended its adoption by the World Food
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>Credentials Committee</p>
                        <p>As a result of efforts by the African group to change the composition of
                            the Committee from that used in the General Assembly, the Credentials
                            Committee spent the better part of the Conference period discussing its
                            own membership. With the cooperation of the PRC, who agreed to withdraw
                            from the Committee, the African group proposed that Zambia fill the
                            Chinese seat in the Committee and that it further be elected President.
                            This latter proposal was resisted by the United States and other Group B
                            countries, particularly since the motivation for this move was unclear
                            and the change could set an unfavorable precedent for future UN
                            activities. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the
                            Philippines, another Group 77 member, would normally have had the
                            Presidency. The consequent absence of a solid Group 77 position further
                            delayed resolution of the issue. Sporadic meetings were held throughout
                            the first eight days of the Conference. The question was finally
                            resolved in favor of Zambia after it became clear to the United States
                            that the proposed change would not result in adverse decisions on
                            sensitive credentials issues. Once the membership problem was settled,
                            the participants' credentials were approved routinely.</p>
                        <p>Work of the Conference</p>
                        <p>The Conference met in plenary session beginning on November 5. The first
                            session opened with ceremonial speeches by UN Secretary-General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WK5">Waldheim</persName>, Italian President
                                <persName corresp="#p_LG2">Leone</persName>, and Conference
                            Secretary-General Marei. Guiseppi Medici of Italy was elected President
                            of the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Substantial difficulty was encountered in the selection of the remaining
                            officers of the Conference. The Group of 77 insisted on a. larger share
                            of bureau and committee officers, rejecting the generally accepted UN
                            formula proportioning for the 77, for Group B, and for the Socialist
                            countries. After three days of fruitless negotiation on this question,
                            the Group B countries acquiesced to the 77 proposal, while making clear
                            that the decision was based on a desire not to threaten the success of
                            the Conference, that it was taken reluctantly and should not be regarded
                            as a precedent for future international meetings. Resolution of this
                            issue permitted essential Committee work to begin</p>
                        <p>The plenary sessions were occupied through November 11 with formal
                            statements by national delegations and representatives of international
                            organizations. Plenary speeches were opened by Secretary Kissinger,
                            whose statement to a great extent set the tone for further discussions.
                            The plenary resumed on November 14 to consider the work of the
                            Committees. In the course of the last three days of the Conference, it
                            approved 22 resolutions and the Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger
                            and Malnutrition. The approved resolutions included, in modified form,
                            the original resolutions proposed by the Secretariat in the Third
                            PrepCom with all the additional resolutions, with the exception of
                            follow-up mechanisms, emanating from the First Committee. All measures
                            were approved without a vote. However, on a number of resolutions,
                            several countries noted in formal statements that, had the item come to
                            a vote, they would have abstained. The United States delegation did this
                            in the case of the Resolution on disarmament and food production. The
                            only major country to reserve on an issue of central importance to the
                            Conference was the PRC, which declared its reservations on the food
                            information and food reserves resolutions as involving impingement on
                            national sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>Closing statements by chairmen of the various groups reflected general
                            satisfaction with Conference results, although Algeria, speaking on
                            behalf of the 77, was less than enthusiastic in its appraisal, the tone
                            of its comments being that although half a loaf is better than none, it
                            did not meet the expectations with which the developing countries had
                            entered the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Future Meetings </p>
                        <p>No future meetings of the World Food Conference are planned. A detailed
                            follow-up program was recommended by the Conference and is discussed in
                            detail in the following section.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The World Food Conference was a considerable success from the U.S.
                            standpoint. A framework was developed for concerted international action
                            on the food problem and U.S. objectives were almost completely achieved.
                            Despite heavy rhetoric in some areas, a conciliatory spirit prevailed on
                            substantive issues and bloc confrontation was avoided.</p>
                        <p>The meeting could be divided into two categories in terms of the tone of
                            discussions and the nature of the outcome. The first category might be
                            termed the rhetorical sphere, which included the plenary sessions, the
                            drafting committee on the Declaration and some aspects of the Third
                            Committee on Trade. Many of the developing countries, particularly more
                            radical members of the Group 77, utilized the plenary forum to the
                            fullest in delivering national speeches excoriating the United States
                            and other developed nations as responsible for the current food crisis
                            and for the generally depressed economic state of developing countries.
                            They called for radical adjustments in the current economic order and
                            for reparations from developed to developing countries. Fortunately,
                            however, polemics were largely confined to speechifying and did not, for
                            the most part, carry over into the second category of substantive
                            discussions. Despite efforts of some of the more radical members of the
                            Group 77 to place discussions in a more political and ideological
                            context, work on substantive resolutions generally stuck close to the
                            subject matter. The only exceptions were resolutions, sponsored by
                            Algeria and Peru respectively, calling for food aid to victims of
                            colonial wars in Africa (Portuguese territories) and for reduction of
                            armaments to free additional funds for food production.</p>
                        <p>One reason for success in avoiding an atmosphere reminiscent of the April
                            1974 <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Special Session was the
                            serious attitude of most of the developing countries in seeking a
                            positive outcome. Socialist countries were generally passive and often
                            took positions paralleling those of Group B, although they employed
                            strong rhetoric in the plenary and declaration drafting group.</p>
                        <p>The broad objective of the United States in entering the Conference was
                            the establishment of a substantive and organizational framework for
                            concerted international effort on several fronts to combat the food
                            problem. This was wholly achieved. The major accomplishment of the
                            Conference was, in fact, supporting creation of a series of follow-up
                            activities and organizations to implement a wide range of specific,
                            useful, and agreed upon recommendations for national and international
                            action. While these are all included in complete detail in Annex A, the
                            following is a brief resume of the major items.</p>
                        <p>Heading the list is the World Food Council, a variation of an idea
                            presented by Conference Secretary-General Marei at the Third PrepCom.
                            The Council will be high level, limited membership UN organ, charged
                            with overall review of follow-up action in all food policy areas.
                            Council mercers will be nominated by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> and elected by the General Assembly. It would report
                            to the General Assembly through ECOSOC. The Council would be
                            headquartered in Rome and serviced within the framework of FAO, although
                            encouraged to seek assistance from any appropriate UN agency. While
                            assigned a coordinating role, it would have no authority beyond moral
                            suasion to force action on the part of governments or UN bodies. The
                            U.S. supported adoption of the Council recommendation by the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the Council, the Conference recommended several, perhaps
                            even more important, bodies with specific responsibility for one or more
                            aspects of food policy:</p>
                        <p>a. Committee on World Food Security will review supply, demand, and stock
                            data as well as steps taken by governments to implement the proposed
                            international undertaking on world food security. This was supported by
                            the U.S. However, we made the further recommendation, which was accepted
                            by the Conference, urging major grain importers and exporters to begin
                            urgent talks on a reserve system. This, in somewhat vaguer terms, is
                            what Secretary Kissinger proposed as the Reserves Coordination
                            Group.</p>
                        <p>b. Consultative group on food production and investment in developing
                            countries. This is a further U.S. initiative for creation of a group
                            composed of bilateral and multilateral donors and representatives of
                            developing countries charged with coordinating and seeking an increased
                            volume and efficiency of financial and technical assistance to
                            agricultural production. The group will be chaired by <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and will be staffed jointly by IBRD,
                            FAO, and <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>c. Reconstitution of World Food Program Inter-Governmental Committee to
                            enable it to serve as a food aid policy and coordinating body in
                            addition to carrying out its current activities. The U.S. did not
                            propose this recommendation. However, we suggested the creation also of
                            a Food Aid Subcommittee under the Consultative Group mentioned above to
                            coordinate food aid policy, negotiations, and financing for the 10
                            million tons minimum annual food aid commitment recommended by the
                            Conference. We expect that the establishment of this Subcommittee will
                            be among the first order of business of the Consultative Group when it
                            gets underway.</p>
                        <p>d. Resource availability. The U.S. proposed and the Conference accepted a
                            recommendation that the Development Committee of IBRD and IMF undertake
                            continuing review of the adequacy of external resources available for
                            investment in the food production and procurement of both food and
                            agricultural inputs.</p>
                        <p>e. Nutrition. The Conference requested ECOSOC to study the need for new
                            institutions or adjustments in the current UN system to ensure effective
                            follow-up on its nutrition recommendations, chief among which were US
                            proposals for a global nutrition surveillance system and an
                            internationally coordinated program in applied nutritional research.</p>
                        <p>f. Agricultural Development Fund. This is a new Fund proposed originally
                            by the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries, but later
                            sponsored by numerous developed countries - Australia, The Netherlands
                            and New Zealand. The Fund would receive voluntary contributions and
                            resources would be dispensed through existing international and regional
                            lending institutions to avoid creation of a further bureaucratic
                            structure. The resolution specified that the Development Fund will not
                            come into being until the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with
                            pledging countries, determines that the Fund holds promise of generating
                            substantial additional resources for development assistance, and that
                            its operations have a reasonable prospect for continuity. The US
                            supported the proposal in hopes that it will be used as a vehicle for
                            promoting development by the countries with surplus oil revenues, but
                            the US has no present intention of contributing to the Fund, and will
                            continue directing its substantial multilateral contributions through
                            existing institutions.</p>
                        <p>g. Research. Follow-up on research will remain the responsibility of the
                            Consultative Group on international agricultural research.</p>
                        <p>h. Additional follow-up. Action on fertilizers, pesticides, .and a food
                            information system will remain the responsibility of appropriate
                            subgroups within FAO.</p>
                        <p>The US supported all of these proposals except as noted above.</p>
                        <p>Our position on Committee I resolutions is clearly spelled out in the
                            section of the report dealing with that Committee.</p>
                        <p>The US fully supported the resolutions prepared by Committee II. On
                            Committee III, the US, in cooperation with other Group B countries, was
                            able to obtain a final resolution far more acceptable than that which
                            had been proposed by the Group 77 countries. While not fully in accord
                            with our interest, the resolution does not contain substantive
                            recommendations for follow-on mechanisms, and operative paragraphs were
                            sufficiently finalized that the delegation felt that we should let it
                            stand without opposition. The same is true of the Declaration on Hunger
                            and Malnutrition which, in its final form, was generally acceptable
                            though not all that we might have desired. Given the original position
                            of the developing countries on these two issues, the final product
                            represented a considerable compromise on their part, and as such,
                            merited U.S. acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Whether the Conference ultimately produces beneficial results will depend
                            on the degree of seriousness with follow-up is pursued by international
                            agencies and participating governments, particularly the major developed
                            and developing nations.</p>
                        <p>ANNEX D</p>
                        <p>Summary of Non-Governmental Organization Activities</p>
                        <p>I. Pre-Conference Activities </p>
                        <p>Throughout the 10 month preparatory period leading up to the WFC, a
                            primary objective of U.S. policy was the open and active encouragement
                            of non-government involvement in the process of preparing for the
                            Conference. Based upon both official and public initiatives, and with
                            the full support of the Office of the U.S. Coordinator for the WFC, the
                            American Freedom from Hunger Foundation sponsored the establishment of a
                            World Hunger Action Coalition. The Coalition eventually grew to include
                            more than 75 U.S. non-government organizations and became the focal
                            point for a close relationship between official U.S. Government
                            preparations for the Conference and the views and opinions of
                            non-government organizations and individuals on major food issues.
                            During the year, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> Coordinator and
                            members of his staff participated in more than 50 separate <gloss
                                target="#t_NGO1">NGO</gloss> events throughout the United States,
                            including speaking engagements, seminars, conferences and general
                            briefings. While many of these events were sponsored by Coalition
                            members, others were sponsored individually. In particular, the United
                            Nations Association of the United States sponsored several such meetings
                            in many parts, of the country.</p>
                        <p>In early September, the US Coordinator's Office and the Coalition
                            sponsored a day-long seminar for non-government organizations. The
                            purpose of this meeting was to provide a forum, prior to the
                            finalization of U.S. positions, for NGO views, opinions, and comments on
                            the U.S. approach to the Conference. <gloss target="#t_AFFHF1"
                                >AFFHF</gloss>'s Coalition assisted in this effort, issuing
                            invitations and providing staff for the meeting. The seminar also
                            included a number of senior U.S. officials, including Secretary Butz,
                            Ambassador Martin, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Administrator
                            Daniel Parker, and others from several government agencies. NGO
                            participants numbered approximately 400.</p>
                        <p>II. Conference Activities</p>
                        <p>Continuing its policy of close rapport with NGOs, the U.S. Delegation in
                            Rome undertook several activities to ensure a continuing dialogue with
                            U.S. groups at the WFC. An NGO liaison officer was appointed within the
                            Delegation and immediately began working with the President of the
                            American Freedom from Hunger Foundation (also the Chairman of the World
                            Hunger Action Coalition) as a liaison team in Rome between the U.S.
                            Delegation and the various U.S. non-government organizations. Informal
                            arrangements were made for the Hunger Coalition to borrow an office at
                            U.S. <gloss target="#t_Del1">Del</gloss> Headquarters in order to
                            further these objectives. The office was staffed at Coalition expense
                            and took over many of the problems of visiting NGO officials that
                            otherwise would have fallen to the Delegation or the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The primary role of the U.S. Delegation NGO liaison officer was to keep
                            senior members of the official delegation informed of NGO views and
                            concerns. In addition, it was this officer's responsibility to relate,
                            on a continuing basis, official U.S. positions to non-government
                            representatives, both individually and collectively, whenever
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>NGO activities at the Conference included a number of organized events.
                            Among these were a series of NGO briefings and workshops, organized by
                            the UN Secretariat, for the entire duration of the Conference. As a
                            means of promoting a meaningful exchange of information, U.S. Delegation
                            officials and U.S. NGOs were invited to participate in these to the
                            extent possible. The first of these briefings was held on the second day
                            of the Conference, Wednesday, November 6, with Secretary of Agriculture
                            Butz, Chairman of the U.S. Delegation, as the initial participant and
                            speaker. Later participants included Congressman James Symington,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA5">Anne Armstrong</persName>, Counselor to
                            the President, and other U.S. officials. The U.S. also held a daily
                            press briefing, and NGO officials were encouraged to attend these as a
                            means of updating their knowledge of U.S. positions and approaches.</p>
                        <p>During the two weeks of the Conference, nearly all of the 40-50 U.S. NGOs
                            were contacted personally by the NGO officer of the U.S. Delegation.
                            (The actual number of U.S. NGO personnel at the Conference exceeded 300
                            people.) Further, the liaison efforts of the World Hunger Action
                            Coalition Officer reinforced the conduit of information between NGOs and
                            the U.S. Delegation.</p>
                        <p>One of the most useful mechanisms for NGO influence was their ability to
                            deal directly with the many Congressmen, Senators, and Congressional
                            staff attending the Conference. The U.S. Delegation NGO Officer actively
                            assisted in introductions, assuring that the NGO officials had access to
                            their elected representatives.</p>
                        <p>Other events providing a forum for an exchange of views between NGOs and
                            the U.S. Delegation included Mrs. Armstrong's first official speech at
                            the Conference to a group of nearly 300 NGOs from the U.S. and other
                            parts of the world. In addition, the Delegation NGO Officer conducted
                            individual briefings for a special delegation of NGOs from the State of
                            Pennsylvania, met with U.S. <gloss target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss>
                            officials, briefed several student groups and arranged a meeting between
                            leaders of American voluntary agencies and several U.S. Senators and
                            Congressmen. Nearly 20 leaders of U.S. NGOs also met privately with Mrs.
                            Armstrong. American agribusiness officials attending the Conference were
                            also briefed personally on separate occasions by Ambassador Martin and
                            Mrs. Armstrong. A highlight of the second week of the Conference was an
                            NGO meeting organized by the <gloss target="#t_AFFHF1">AFFHF</gloss> for
                            U.S. groups. This "open forum" was attended by most U.S. NGOs, four U.S.
                            Senators, five House Members and several official U.S. Delegates.</p>
                        <p>During the Conference, the U.S. Hunger Coalition was chosen a member of
                            the eleven-member NGO steering committee directing NGO activities at the
                            Conference. In addition, the Chairman of the Coalition met personally
                            with Secretary Butz and arranged continuing follow-up contact with NGOs
                            from other countries, particularly other donor countries, through the
                            American Freedom from Hunger Foundation. </p>

                        <p>BACKGROUND </p>
                        <p>At the World Food Conference (<gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss>) in
                            November, the United States proposed a five-part program to deal with
                            the three basic aspects of the world food problem-increased food
                            production, food transfers from surplus to deficit areas, and food
                            security. The United States took the initiative in calling for formation
                            of:</p>
                        <p>-- an Exporters Planning Group to stimulate policy planning for maximum
                            production by food exporters;</p>
                        <p>-- a Consultative Group on Food Production and Investment to accelerate
                            production in developing countries by evaluating needs, channeling
                            investment flows from old and new donors, providing technical support
                            and inducing production-oriented policies among recipients;</p>
                        <p>-- a food aid subcommittee of the Consultative Group to involve new
                            donors in financing food transfers under a concept of forward planning
                            of food aid;</p>
                        <p>-- consideration by the new IBRD-<gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            Development Committee of mechanisms to resolve the long-term problem of
                            transferring resources for both investment in production and financing
                            food deficits;</p>
                        <p>-- a Reserves Coordinating Group of major grain exporters and importers
                            to develop an international system of national grain reserves to provide
                            reasonable assurance of the availability of adequate supplies of
                            grains.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the United States made commitments and offered proposals
                            for improving agricultural research and nutrition levels, especially of
                            vulnerable population groups.</p>
                        <p>The WFC responded well to the US initiative. It adopted twenty
                            resolutions, some of which are hortatory, but which incorporate
                            most--although not all--of our five core proposals. Specifically, the
                            WFC sanctioned collaboration among the major grain exporters and
                            importers to develop an effective reserves arrangement; it called upon
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                >FAO</gloss> and UNDP to establish the Consultative Group; it did
                            not explicitly provide for a food aid subcommittee, but we believe doing
                            so can be among the Group’s first business; it requested the IBRD-IMF
                            Development Committee to consider means to achieve needed resource
                            transfers. But the WFC did not act on endorsing a mechanism for
                            cooperation among food exporters alone, although this lack of an
                            endorsement is not a barrier to establishing a framework for
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>US STRATEGY FOR FOLLOW-UP</p>
                        <p>United States initiatives are designed to construct an institutional
                            framework for long-term international cooperation on the food problem.
                            The WFC laid a better basis for cooperation by calling attention to the
                            food problem as one which cannot be resolved by the US alone or by the
                            developed countries together--but only through sustained global action.
                            Our strategy is concerned with the three interrelated elements of food
                            production, financing and security.</p>
                        <p>Production. We believe that cooperation among the principle exporters can
                            contribute to sustaining high levels of production without creating
                            market depressing surpluses. Structuring their cooperation also will
                            enhance the ability of exporters to deal more effectively with importer
                            demands for grain supplies both on commercial and concessiorial
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>Development Financing. The main exporters, who number only five (US,
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, Australia, Argentina and Canada),
                            cannot alone expect to meet the needs of a world population that will
                            nearly double by the end of this century. Increased investments along
                            with important (and potentially unpopular) policy shifts in food deficit
                            developing countries are essential to securing an adequate level of
                            world food production. Securing these elements requires cooperation
                            among the technologically advanced traditional donors, the developing
                            countries with significant production potential, and new donors--the oil
                            exporters. A multilateral mechanism (the Consultative Group on Food
                            Production and Investment) offers the best hope for inducing the
                            necessary investment and encouraging production oriented policies in
                            developing countries by the way in which investment flows are
                            directed.</p>
                        <p>Food Aid Financing. We conceive of food aid as being of two distinct
                            types. One type is emergency relief, e.g., Honduras or Cambodia. The
                            other type is a form of balance of payments support particularly suited
                            to the interests of the recipient or of the donor or of both. Through
                            existing international structures and a food aid subcommittee of the
                            Consultative Group, we will work to increase the food aid financing
                            contributions of others, while increasing our production to meet both
                            concessional and commercial demand.</p>
                        <p>Food Security. Crop shortfalls since 1972 combined with rising demand for
                            food have virtually exhausted the worlds reserve cushion against future
                            food emergencies. Record high food prices are one manifestation of the
                            consequences of a tight supply situation; another is the competition for
                            available United States export supplies.</p>
                        <p>We have taken a major initiative in proposing negotiation of a reserves
                            arrangement that builds upon the FAO-sponsored concept of a system of
                            national reserves held under internationally agreed principles. Our
                            design differs from earlier efforts to conclude commodity agreements,
                            which had price stabilization as the main objective, by focusing instead
                            upon assuring a quantity of grain adequate to provide reasonable
                            security of supply. In this concept, moderation of extreme fluctuations
                            in price would be an important side effect, but changes in price would
                            continue to be the main regulator of production. We are proposing that
                            the major grain exporters and importers--a group of about 20 countries--
                            negotiate such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>These initiatives each involve establishing a new multilateral mechanism.
                            Each deals with an important part of an overall solution to the food
                            problem. Taken together they would include the major international
                            actors--the grain exporters and traditional aid donors, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the food security system, the oil
                            exporters as new sources of finance, and the developing countries as
                            investment and food aid recipients.</p>
                        <p>The food problem is an important aspect of global interdependence. The
                            strategy we are pursuing reflects this fact in the institutions we are
                            proposing to deal with the problem.</p>
                        <p>ISSUES/NEXT STEPS</p>
                        <p>Securing the cooperation of other grain exporters in a structure for
                            cooperation--an Exporters Planning Group-- requires overcoming their
                            suspicions about both our economic and political objectives. We intend
                            to convene an initial exporters consultation early next year at which we
                            will lay out practical steps toward formation of this Group and the
                            objectives it would serve.</p>
                        <p>Participation of the oil exporters in arrangements for funding
                            agricultural development and food aid is important. Again, this will be
                            difficult to achieve. These newly rich countries do not necessarily
                            accord high priority to these objectives and they are resistant to
                            multilateral guidance--such as we hope will be provided by the
                            Consultative Group on Food Production and Investment. However, there are
                            possible trade-offs between increased financing of food aid by
                            traditional donors and funding from the oil exporters for capital
                            investment, including agricultural development. It also will be possible
                            to use the proposed Consultative Group on Food Production and investment
                            as a source of technical support for project funding done bilaterally.
                            The IBRD is taking the lead in establishing the Consultative Group, and
                            we expect initial consultations to be held in January.</p>
                        <p>Both the existing multilateral Food Aid Convention and Consultative Group
                            food aid sub-committee we favor, give donors control of the allocation
                            of food aid. We have responded to the interests of the LDCs in accepting
                            the principle of forward planning for food aid and a 10 million ton
                            annual target, but they also hope to channel more food aid through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s World Food Program where they
                            can influence allocation. We will evolve tactics for dealing with this
                            issue in collaboration with the other donors over the coming months.</p>
                        <p>The other principal prospective members of a grain reserves system have
                            agreed to meet with us early next year to set objectives for
                            negotiations, but there are two important exceptions--the Soviet Union
                            and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>. The Soviets maintain
                            cautious interest but without committing themselves. Soviet
                            participation is important and we have informed them that
                            non-participants will not enjoy the same benefits as members. The PRC
                            formally refrained from endorsing the Food Conference call for a
                            reserves arrangement and probably will not participate. While desirable,
                            we do not view PRC participation as essential.</p>
                        <p>We can hold initial meetings without US decisions on: a) trade objectives
                            (the degree of access to markets we will seek and the relationship of a
                            reserves agreement to the <gloss target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss>), or b)
                            the role of the US Government in holding or guaranteeing the US share of
                            reserves. But decisions on these issues will be needed when actual
                            negotiations begin.</p>

                        <p>The President: It is good to see you again. It is always good to get
                            together with you.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: I am very pleased to have a chance to meet with you. I have
                            been involved in a lot of things since we last talked.</p>
                        <p>The President: Where are you these days?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: I have spent most of my time in Rome, but I have gotten up to
                            Michigan; as you know, I have a farm in northern Michigan.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes, I know you spend some time up there.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: Well, I have a big story to tell and I want to tell it as
                            concisely as possible.</p>
                        <p>The World Food Conference brought together governments of every
                            significant country. One hundred and thirty-three countries--developing
                            countries, less developed countries, communist and non-communist. In 10
                            days they had reached general agreement on what the world should do to
                            help feed needy people, particularly those of the poorest countries.
                            There were 16 resolutions passed. Most dealt with how to increase food
                            production and how to provide food to countries with food deficits.</p>
                        <p>With the rate of increase in population as it is at present, food
                            production must increase about 25 million tons a year but it has not. In
                            1973 and 1974, per capita food production was less than in 1960. In
                            1985, unless birth rates decline, the sum of the food gaps in importing
                            countries will be between 85 and 100 million tons.</p>
                        <p>Other countries may produce this much or close to it, but it is difficult
                            to move food to food deficit areas. Two years ago we sold grains to the
                            Soviet Union and China--about 20 million tons but it was physically
                            difficult to transfer the food.</p>
                        <p>Well, at the end of the Conference, two things were agreed on. Everyone
                            agreed on the importance of increasing food production, especially in
                            deficit countries. And they agreed that it was essential to increase
                            food security to help victims of natural disaster. They agreed on 10
                            million tons per year for three years. I was able to get international
                            agreement to provide these amounts. That has not been difficult. But
                            people are also concerned with future food reserves. We definitely need
                            to establish a food reserve scheme and (turning to Secretary Butz) we
                            should not get lost in arguments about who controls it. At the same
                            time, I recognize that we need incentives to maintain production in the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>The last part of the recommendation was to establish a mechanism for
                            initiating, monitoring, and coordinating to get countries and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to implement other recommendations of the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>The President: This is the Council?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: Yes, I am the Executive Director. We will have a meeting on
                            May 5 and 6.</p>
                        <p>The President: How many members are on the Council?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: Thirty-six. That is too many, but we needed an appropriate
                            balance from Latin America, Africa and Asia, developed countries and
                            less developed countries. Members are chosen by the countries whom they
                            represent--Africa, 9; Asia, 7; Latin America, 7; western countries, 9;
                            and communist countries 2 or 3. All the big food exporters are in it
                            except the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Food aid in emergencies is not hard. I have the contributions. But the
                            other significant recommendation, suggested by <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>, is the international agricultural development fund.
                            It was agreed that the UN Secretary General should call a meeting of
                            representatives from the developed and developing countries with proper
                            regional balance to find out whether a fund could be established. He
                            first turned to the 36 countries in the Council. He asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PRW2"
                                >Peterson</persName>, and others to set the fund up. But no one
                            wanted the job. The Secretary General is now doing it himself.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the World Food Conference, the US had no interest in the
                                <gloss target="#t_IADF1">IADF</gloss>; but it went along if OPEC
                            would provide the funds. Originally 11 OPEC countries supported the idea
                            and only 3 <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> countries. The Secretary
                            General has agreed to a special conference on May 5-6 in Geneva to see
                            if there is adequate support. I have tried to find out whether OPEC
                            still supports this. I did so by sending them letters to find out
                            whether May 5-6 were good days for a conference. This was an opening to
                            determine the interest of OPEC. All said they were still interested. I
                            want to get OPEC to provide 50% of the funds—the total will be $1
                            billion per year for three years and they will provide half of it. Most
                            of the aid will go to the very poorest countries.</p>
                        <p>The May meeting will talk about whether or not it is feasible to
                            establish this fund. Actually, it is not a fund since we don't need a
                            new fund. Countries which put in the money should have a say on where it
                            goes. They will be a Board of 1/3 OPEC, 1/3 developing countries, 1/3
                            developed countries. This is the OPEC formula. At the meeting 61
                            countries will be involved--18 western countries, 15 OPEC, 6 communist,
                            and 22 <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p>We want to investigate whether it is feasible. However, we know we will
                            not be able to get more money for a special fund. The money will be
                            channeled bilaterally. I know <persName corresp="#p_POE1"
                                >Passman</persName> feels strongly about this and so do most other
                            countries including the Saudis. The fund will actually consist of aid
                            provided bilaterally. Anything above the assistance to food and
                            agriculture development provided in 1974 will count toward a country's
                            contribution, but the money will not be put into a fund but go through
                            bilateral channels.</p>
                        <p>I am talking about $1 billion per year and I want it to go into effect on
                            January 1, 1976. Countries will agree to a program of three years. The
                            fund will become operational when there are 6 OPEC and 6 DAC countries
                            with a total pledge of 1 billion <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss>'s
                            over three years.</p>
                        <p>Why is this important? For the first 175 years of our 200-year history,
                            the US was seen as a friend of poor countries. But we have lost this.
                            There are not going to be many chances. Five months after the food
                            conference is over, the world is still looking for ways to help meet
                            food needs of poor countries. The only people who appear really tough
                            are western nations. The US has to do its fair share.</p>
                        <p>In the least favorable sharing basis, the US would provide 38, 39, or 40%
                            of the $500 million contribution from DAC countries, or approximately
                            $200 million per year for increasing production of food and
                            agriculture.</p>
                        <p>This entity is a coordinating enterprise. The money can be directed
                            bilaterally as Passman talks about.</p>
                        <p>Basically, Mr. President, the US needs a coordinated policy on
                            international economic issues. The Development Coordinating Committee
                            was put together while I was still at <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>. It can be a very important factor in coordinating
                            development assistance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: We want to identify the US contribution as a US
                            contribution.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: Yes. The contributions will be bilateral but fit into a
                            multilateral framework. There will be no funds for countries who do not
                            make decisions to help themselves. The primary emphasis will be on food
                            aid for poor countries, but they will have to do something to help
                            themselves. At the May meeting, I do not need a US pledge except that I
                            would like the US to say that it will do its "fair share.” Between May
                            and October, we will work further in setting up the fund. In the
                            interim, we will try to get other countries to commit themselves, but no
                            formal commitment will be needed until October.</p>
                        <p>The President: But if OPEC doesn't put up all of its money, ours will be
                            less?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: That is right, Mr. President.</p>
                        <p>The President: What is the possibility of funding?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRD1">Hormats</persName>: The US has increased
                            its funding for agricultural development from $306 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74 to $476 million in FY 75—$170 million.
                            Plans are to increase it further to $679 million in FY 76, but this
                            depends heavily on Congressional appropriations. The action taken by the
                            Congress on the present aid bill, cutting this category from $546
                            million to $300 million is a negative sign. But it is likely that we
                            will have a $200 million increase above 1974 levels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cannon: My concern, Mr. President, is that after you veto the
                            agriculture bill, this sort of assistance to farmers in developing
                            countries might be criticized.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Butz: Yes, but the money is being appropriated anyhow. This is
                            not really a new program.</p>
                        <p>Dr, Hannah: Yes, you should be able to make the $200 million figure.</p>
                        <p>The President: It would be helpful if you could testify before Otto.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: If that is what it takes, Mr. President, I would be
                            delighted.</p>
                        <p>The President: Basically, this idea makes sense. I think that it is
                            feasible in the Congress and that it can be sold in this country.</p>
                        <p>Tell me when the meetings are again—May 5 and 6 in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hannah: And another meeting on the 25th of June. The whole idea for
                            this World Food Conference came from the Declaration of the group of 77
                            in Algiers and Kissinger's UN speech. The US needs to establish a basis
                            of support in the Third World. We cannot afford to alienate them
                            now.</p>
                        <p>The President (to Hormats): Will you tell Henry about this and indicate
                            that he may want to use this in his food speech. I understand he wants
                            to give that but has not decided where.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SLW1">Seidman</persName>: Yes, he wants to give
                            a food speech but I don't think he has set the place yet.</p>
                        <p>The President (to Hormats): Okay. This can be something he can use in his
                            speech.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hannah: Well, Mr. President, thank you very much. I am glad to have
                            the chance to discuss this with you and I think there are some important

                        <p>1. SUMMARY. THE U.S. IS TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM CREATED AT THE
                            WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE (<gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss>) TO
                            ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON FOOD. THE PROSPECTIVE
                            IMPROVEMENT IN THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE IN 1975/76 MAY LULL
                            NATIONS INTO COMPLACENCY AND DELAY ACTION, MAKING FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS
                            MORE ONEROUS WHEN SHORTAGE SITUATIONS REOCCUR. IN OUR FOOD STRATEGY, WE
                            ARE GIVING PRIORITY TO ACHIEVING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON ACTION IN
                            THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (1) INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION IN THE LDCS; (2)
                            MAINTAINING A REASONABLE LEVEL OF FOOD AID FOR NEEDY COUNTRIES IN THE
                            INTERIM YEARS; (3) ESTABLISHING A WORLD FOOD SECURITY RESERVE AND (4)
                            ACHIEVING SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN BARRIERS TO AGRICULTURAL TRADE. THESE
                            ELEMENTS OF OUR STRATEGY ARE ELABORATED BELOW. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. PRODUCTION SHORT-FALLS AND HIGH PRICES FOR FOOD DURING THE PAST THREE
                            YEARS CREATED WAVE OF ALARM ABOUT LONGER TERM WORLD FOOD PROSPECTS.
                            ALTHOUGH MOST EXPERTS AGREE THAT SUDDEN SHIFT IN GLOBAL SUPPLY/DEMAND
                            BALANCE WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY TRANSITORY FACTORS, ONE LONGER-RUN
                            CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT ASSURING
                            PRODUCTION AND AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLIES WORLD-WIDE. THE
                            WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE (WFC) HELD IN ROME IN NOVEMBER 1974 AND ITS
                            FOLLOW-UP INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRIMARY MEANS FOR FOCUSING THIS GENERAL
                            CONCERN.</p>
                        <p>3. INTERNAL <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM
                            FOR FOLLOWING UP 22 WFC RECOMMENDATIONS IS INTERNATIONAL FOOD REVIEW
                            GROUP (<gloss target="#t_IFRG1">IFRG</gloss>), ESTABLISHED AT DIRECTION
                            OF THE PRESIDENT AS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD. GROUP, COMPOSED OF THE
                            HEADS OF EIGHT WASHINGTON AGENCIES, IS CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY OF
                            STATE, AND THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE IS VICE-CHAIRMAN. FUNCTIONING
                            UNDER REVIEW GROUP IS PARALLEL WORKING GROUP AT ASSISTANT SECRETARY
                            LEVEL.</p>
                        <p>4. SINCE NOVEMBER, WE HAVE STRESSED DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY, THROUGH
                            MECHANISM OF IFRG, IN THREE AREAS: (1) INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION IN THE
                            LDCS; (2) PROVIDING A REASONABLE LEVEL OF FOOD AID UNTIL <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> AND CROP PRODUCTION DEFICITS CAN BE
                            MADE UP; (3) ESTABLISHING A WORLD FOOD SECURITY RESERVE SYSTEM. THESE
                            THREE AREAS RECEIVED PRIME EMPHASIS AT WFC. LIBERALIZATION OF
                            AGRICULTURAL TRADE, OUR FOURTH OBJECTIVE, IS BEING PRESSED IN THE <gloss
                                target="#t_MTN1">MTN</gloss>. IT COULD ALSO BE AN ELEMENT IN OUR
                            FOOD SECURITY RESERVE SYSTEM.</p>
                        <p>5. INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION IN LDCS. THE HEART OF THE FOOD PROBLEM IS
                            WIDENING DISPARITY BETWEEN LDC PRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS OF STILL
                            RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION. LDC IMPORT REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY
                            RUNNING AT ABOUT 25 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN ANNUALLY. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> PROJECTIONS SHOW THIS GROWING TO AS MUCH
                            AS 85 MILLION TONS BY 1985; <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss>'S
                            WORST CASE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT 10 MILLION TONS LESS. WHILE MAJOR GRAIN
                            EXPORTERS, MAINLY NORTH AMERICA, COULD PRODUCE SUCH QUANTITIES,
                            FINANCING, TRANSPORTING, UNLOADING AND DISTRIBUTING THEM WOULD BE
                            DIFFICULT, PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE, TASK. THIS IS SO-CALLED FOOD GAP, ABOUT
                            ONE-THIRD OF WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY SOUTH ASIA.</p>
                        <p>6. TODAY LDCS CULTIVATE 35 PERCENT MORE LAND THAN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES BUT
                            PRODUCE 30 PERCENT LESS FOOD. PARADOXICALLY, LDCS POSSESS GREATEST
                            CAPACITY FOR INCREASING CROP YIELDS AND OVERALL OUTPUT OVER NEXT SEVERAL
                            DECADES. SOLUTION TO FOOD PROBLEM THEREFORE LIES IN TAPPING POTENTIAL OF
                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF UNDERUTILIZED LAND AND WATER WHICH, IF
                            COMBINED WITH OTHER INPUTS SUCH AS FERTILIZER, IMPROVED SEED VARIETIES
                            AND PROPER PRODUCTION INCENTIVES, COULD BRING ABOUT MULTIPLE INCREASES
                            IN AVERAGE CROP YIELDS.</p>
                        <p>7. TO HELP ACCOMPLISH THIS, U.S. IS GIVING HIGHER PRIORITY IN ITS FOREIGN
                            ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT. IN
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1975, DOLS. 476 MILLION IS
                            PROGRAMMED FOR THESE PURPOSES COMPARED TO DOLS. 306 MILLION IN FY-1974,
                            AND APPROPRIATION OF DOLS. 679 MILLION IS REQUESTED FOR FY-1976. IN
                            FY-1976, DISBURSEMENTS FOR THESE PURPOSES WILL ACCOUNT FOR OVER 60
                            PERCENT OF <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'S PROPOSED BILATERAL
                            DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, IN CONTRAST WITH ONLY 35 PERCENT IN
                            FY-1974. IN ADDITION, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, AMONG
                            MULTILATERAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS, RECENTLY DECIDED TO DOUBLE LOANS FOR
                            RURAL DEVELOPMENT OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS. </p>
                        <p>8. APART FROM ENCOURAGING HIGHER PRIORITY FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN
                            EXISTING BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AID PROGRAMS, WFC RECOMMENDED TWO
                            NEW INSTITUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM--CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON FOOD
                            PRODUCTION AND INVESTMENT (CGFPI) AND INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR
                            AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (<gloss target="#t_IFAD1">IFAD</gloss>).
                            CGFPI--SET UP UNDER THE AUSPICES OF IBRD, <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                >FAO</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_UNDP1">UNDP</gloss>--WILL HAVE
                            FIRST MEETING IN JULY. ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR LINKING
                            OVERALL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES TO FUNDING. A PRIMARY TASK OF THIS GROUP
                            WILL BE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION PLAN SETTING NATIONAL
                            STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR KEY COUNTRIES, AND TO EXTENT POSSIBLE,
                            MATCHING AVAILABLE FINANCIAL RESOURCES--DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL--TO
                            NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO ASSURE THAT THESE NATIONAL STANDARDS
                            ARE MET. IFAD WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED BY <gloss target="#t_OPEC1"
                                >OPEC</gloss> COUNTRIES, WON BROAD SUPPORT, AND WAS ADOPTED BY WFC.
                            PROPOSED FUND MAY BE USEFUL MECHANISM FOR SECURING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL
                            CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OIL EXPORTERS. SAUDI ARABIA, <gloss target="#t_UAE1"
                                >UAE</gloss>, AND VENEZUELA, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE SHOWN POSITIVE
                            INTEREST.</p>
                        <p>9. U.S. HAS ANNOUNCED ITS WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CREATION OF
                            IFAD. BUT WE ARE SEEKING TO GAIN CREDIT FOR SHARPLY INCREASING BILATERAL
                            US AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE BY ATTRIBUTING AS CONTRIBUTION TO IFAD
                            INCREASES OVER SOME BASE YEAR SUCH AS FY-1974 IN FUNDS DEVOTED TO
                            AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN OUR BILATERAL PROGRAMS. STRUCTURE AND
                            MECHANICS OF IFAD, INCLUDING SIZE OF SUBSCRIPTION AND RULES FOR
                            ATTRIBUTION OF FUNDING, REMAIN TO BE WORKED OUT. INITIAL MULTILATERAL
                            CONSULTATION ON IFAD, HELD IN EARLY MAY, ESTABLISHED WORKING GROUP
                            COMPOSED OF <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>, OPEC, AND LDC
                            REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH WILL BEGIN MEETING IN ROME AT END JUNE. </p>
                        <p>10. OVERALL, US OBJECTIVE IS TO INCREASE ANNUAL RATE OF GROWTH IN LDC
                            FOOD PRODUCTION FROM CURRENT 2.5 TO 3.5 PERCENT OVER NEXT TEN YEARS. WFC
                            ESTIMATED THIS WOULD REQUIRE ANNUAL EXTERNAL INVESTMENT IN LDC
                            AGRICULTURE OF DOLS. 5 BILLION--AS COMPARED WITH PRESENTLY ESTIMATED
                            FLOW OF DOLS. 1.5 BILLION.</p>
                        <p>11. FOOD AID. UNTIL MAJOR EXPANSION OF LDC PRODUCTION IS ACHIEVED, PL 480
                            WILL CONTINUE TO BE NECESSARY PROGRAM BOTH TO MEET EMERGENCY AND
                            DISASTER REQUIREMENTS AND TO REDUCE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF COMMERCIAL
                            IMPORTS FOR POORER COUNTRIES. OUR OVERALL RECORD IS GOOD. IN THE 1960S
                            WE AVERAGED 15 MILLION TONS OF FOOD AID IN GRAINS PER YEAR; SINCE 1970
                            THE AVERAGE IS 7.5 MILLION TONS; IN ONLY ONE YEAR OF PAST TWENTY HAVE WE
                            PROVIDED LESS THAN 4 MILLION TONS (FY-74). THIS YEAR WE HAVE PROVIDED
                            OVER 5 MILLION TONS OF FOOD AID, AND WE EXPECT TO INCREASE LEVEL TO 6
                            MILLION TONS IN FY-76. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS WFC'S GLOBAL TARGET
                            OF 10 MILLION TONS OF FOOD AID ANNUALLY AND SECRETARY KISSINGER HAS
                            STATED TWICE IN RECENT WEEKS THAT US WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE
                            AT LEAST 4 MILLION TONS OF THAT TOTAL ON CONTINUING BASIS.</p>
                        <p>12. TIGHT GRAIN SUPPLY SITUATION AND LOWER FOOD AID LEVELS OF PAST TWO
                            YEARS HAVE SPARKED SUBSTANTIAL CONGRESSIONAL CRITICISM AND
                            RE-EXAMINATION OF THE PL 480 PROGRAM. FOOD AID DEBATE HAS BEEN ONE
                            ELEMENT IN THE EXECUTIVE/LEGISLATIVE STRUGGLE OVER FOREIGN POLICY, AND
                            FOOD AID TO INDOCHINA CONSTITUTED A FOCAL POINT OF ATTACK. WITH THIS
                            PROBLEM BEHIND US AND WITH PROSPECT OF RECORD 1975 HARVESTS, WE EXPECT
                            IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE HILL ON PL 480 MATTERS. A LARGE NUMBER OF
                            BILLS AMENDING PL 480 LEGISLATION ARE IN THE HOPPER, INCLUDING ONE BY
                            SENATOR <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">HUMPHREY</persName> WHICH CONTAINS
                            MUCH EXECUTIVE BRANCH CAN SUPPORT, INCLUDING GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO
                            CONTINUE FOOD AID IN SHORT SUPPLY SITUATIONS. MAIN INNOVATIONS ARE NEW
                            TITLE III, WHICH WOULD GIVE PREFERRED STATUS FOR CONCESSIONAL SALES TO

                        <p>13. WORLD FOOD SECURITY RESERVE SYSTEM. OVER PAST THREE YEARS POOR
                            HARVESTS IN SOME KEY COUNTRIES, CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL OF WORLD GRAIN
                            CONSUMPTION, AND RESULTING DRAWDOWN OF TRADITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN GRAIN
                            STOCKS, HAVE SHARPENED WORLD'S AWARENESS OF ITS VULNERABILITY TO FOOD
                            EMERGENCIES. BEGINNING WITH PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT TO UN IN SEPTEMBER
                            1974 AND SECRETARY'S PROPOSAL AT WFC, US HAS TAKEN LEAD IN SEEKING
                            ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF NATIONALLY-HELD GRAIN
                            RESERVES TO ALLEVIATE WORLD SHORTAGES IN BAD CROP YEARS AND REDUCE
                            PRESSURE ON SUPPLY AND MARKETS. WHILE WE ARE STILL IN PROCESS OF
                            DEVELOPING U.S. POSITION ON SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF RESERVES SYSTEM, WE ARE
                            ALSO MAKING CONCENTRATED EFFORTS TO CONVINCE OTHER MAJOR EXPORTERS AND
                            IMPORTERS OF NEED FOR SUCH A SYSTEM.</p>

                            IN SPEECHES AT KANSAS CITY (MAY 13) AND BEFORE <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> IN PARIS (MAY 28). INTERAGENCY CONSIDERATION OF HOW
                            THESE PRINCIPLES WOULD BE EXPRESSED IN PROVISIONS OF AGREEMENT IS
                            CONTINUING. U.S. POSITION NECESSARILY INTENDED TO SERVE INTERESTS OF US
                            PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS AS WELL AS MEET OBJECTIVE OF ASSURING
                            AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES. PRINCIPLES QUOTED FROM MAY 28 SPEECH
                            LISTED BELOW, FOLLOWED IN EACH CASE BY CLARIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING
                            ISSUES.</p>
                        <p>15. QUOTE FIRST, TOTAL WORLD RESERVES MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH TO MEET
                            POTENTIAL SHORTFALLS IN FOOD GRAINS PRODUCTION UNQUOTE. AT WFC US
                            REFERRED TO RESERVES OF UP TO 60 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN, WHICH WE
                            ESTIMATED TO MEET 95 PERCENT OF POTENTIAL SINGLE YEAR PRODUCTION
                            SHORTFALLS OF ALL GRAINS, FEED AS WELL AS FOOD. ROUGHLY HALF THIS AMOUNT
                            PROBABLY ADEQUATE TO COVER SHORTFALLS OF WHEAT AND RICE, THE PRIMARY
                            FOOD GRAINS. INCLUSION OF RICE, HOWEVER, RAISES NUMBER OF PROBLEMS,
                            AMONG THEM, INADEQUATE PRODUCTION DATA. RESERVE MIGHT ALSO INCLUDE
                            PROVISIONS FOR COARSE GRAINS USED FOR FOOD.</p>
                        <p>16. QUOTE SECOND, GRAIN EXPORTERS AND IMPORTERS SHOULD AGREE ON FAIR
                            ALLOCATION OF RESERVE HOLDINGS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WEALTH, PRODUCTIVE
                            CAPACITY AND VOLUME OF TRADE UNQUOTE. IN PAST, U.S. AND CANADA HAVE HELD
                            ALMOST ALL OF WORLD'S GRAIN RESERVES AS RESULT OF DOMESTIC FARM SUPPORT
                            PROGRAMS. THESE RESERVES NO LONGER EXIST, AND PRESENT FARM PROGRAMS
                            LIKELY TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING ACCUMULATION OF UNWANTED
                            SURPLUSES. WE ARE, HOWEVER, PREPARED TO HOLD IMPORTANT PART OF ANY
                            AGREED WORLD RESERVE IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER NATIONS. SHARING OF COST
                            BURDEN OF RESERVES IS KEY POINT IN U.S. POSITION. IN AGREEING ON SIZE OF
                            RESERVE HOLDINGS, WE WOULD TAKE ACCOUNT NOT ONLY OF COUNTRIES' SHARE IN
                            GRAIN TRADE AND COUNTRIES' WEALTH BUT ALSO VARIABILITY OF GRAIN
                            PRODUCTION. THUS, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> GRAIN OUTPUT
                            HISTORICALLY DEVIATES FROM TREND TO FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN IS CASE FOR
                            OTHER PRODUCING COUNTRIES AND IS MAJOR FACTOR IN INSTABILITY OF WORLD
                            SUPPLY.</p>
                        <p>17. QUOTE THIRD, THERE SHOULD BE AGREED INTERNATIONAL RULES OR GUIDELINES
                            TO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO BUILD UP RESERVES IN TIMES OF GOOD HARVEST
                            UNQUOTE. SEE COMMENTS FOR FIFTH POINT.</p>
                        <p>18. QUOTE FOURTH, EACH PARTICIPATING COUNTRY SHOULD BE FREE TO DETERMINE
                            HOW ITS RESERVES WILL BE MAINTAINED AND WHAT INCENTIVES WILL BE PROVIDED
                            FOR THEIR BUILDUP AND MAINTENANCE UNQUOTE. RESERVES WOULD BE
                            NATIONALLY-HELD AND WOULD NOT BE PART OF INTERNATIONALLY CONTROLLED
                            BUFFER STOCK. IN US CASE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ALREADY HAS
                            SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO BUILD, HOLD AND DRAW DOWN RESERVES, EITHER
                            THROUGH INCENTIVES TO FARMERS OR THROUGH GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP. PRESENT
                            U.S. POLICY IS TO RELY ON STOCKS HELD BY FARMERS AND AVOID
                            GOVERNMENT-OWNED STOCKS, BUT LATTER OPTION REMAINS AVAILABLE IF
                            CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT ITS USE.</p>
                        <p>19. QUOTE FIFTH, RULES OR GUIDELINES SHOULD BE AGREED FOR THE DRAW-DOWN
                            OF RESERVES, TRIGGERED BY SHORTFALLS IN WORLD PRODUCTION. THERE MUST BE
                            A CLEAR PRESUMPTION THAT ALL MEMBERS WILL MAKE RESERVES AVAILABLE WHEN
                            NEEDED AND, CONVERSELY, THAT RESERVES WILL NOT BE RELEASED PREMATURELY
                            OR EXCESSIVELY, THEREBY DEPRESSING MARKET PRICES UNQUOTE. THIS, TOGETHER
                            WITH ITEMS THREE AND SIX, ENCOMPASS KEY OPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF RESERVES
                            AGREEMENT, AND CONSEQUENTLY, MAJOR AREA OF DISPUTE. QUESTION OF DEGREE
                            OF COMMITMENT, I.E. IS AGREEMENT TO BE BASED ON FORMAL RULES OR LOOSE
                            GUIDELINES, HAS YET TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN USG. AGREEMENT INVOLVING LARGE
                            DEGREE OF COMMITMENT BY PARTICIPANTS IS EXPECTED TO BETTER ENSURE
                            AVAILABILITY OF RESERVES WHEN NEEDED AND PREVENT THEIR UNWARRANTED
                            RELEASE. LATTER POINT IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO U.S. PRODUCERS
                            CONCERNED ABOUT PRICE-DEPRESSING EFFECT OF LARGE STOCKS. IN PRACTICE,
                            HOWEVER, IT COULD PROVE TOO RIGID, OBLIGATING PARTICIPANTS TO
                            INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS ON THE BASIS OF PREDETERMINED RULES. INTERNATIONAL
                            DISCUSSIONS SO FAR HAVE CONCENTRATED ON TRIGGER MECHANISM, WITH US
                            ADVOCATING TRIGGER BASED ON CHANGES IN WORLD PRODUCTION OR SUPPLY AND
                            MOST OTHER NATIONS FAVORING USE OF PRICE MOVEMENTS TO TRIGGER
                            ACCUMULATION OR RELEASE OF RESERVES. UNDERLYING THIS IS STRONG
                            PREFERENCE OF SOME OTHER COUNTRIES FOR TRADITIONAL COMMODITY AGREEMENT
                            APPROACH TO STABILIZE PRICES, WHICH WE OPPOSE IN PART BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
                            PRICE STABILIZATION AGREEMENT WOULD SET PRICE RANGE AT LEVEL THAT WOULD
                            STIMULATE EXCESS PRODUCTION AT EXPENSE OF EFFICIENT PRODUCERS.</p>
                        <p>20. QUOTE SIXTH, IN TIMES OF SHORTAGE THE SYSTEM MUST ASSURE ACCESS TO
                            SUPPLIES FOR PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES UNQUOTE. ASSURED ACCESS TO SUPPLIES
                            IS PRINCIPAL BENEFIT OF RESERVES AGREEMENT TO IMPORTERS, BUT INTERAGENCY
                            AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED ON HOW THIS ASSURANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED. ONE
                            POSSIBILITY WOULD BE COMMITMENT BY EXPORTERS TO REFRAIN FROM USE OF
                            EXPORT CONTROLS AGAINST OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN TIMES OF SHORTAGE. LACK OF
                            SUCH ASSURANCE COULD BE DECIDING FACTOR IN CONVINCING COUNTRIES SUCH AS
                            USSR TO JOIN AND HOLD THEIR FAIR SHARE OF RESERVES.</p>
                        <p>21. QUOTE SEVENTH, THERE MUST BE SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
                            THE POORER COUNTRIES UNQUOTE. U.S. AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SEEM TO
                            AGREE THAT RESERVES AND FOOD AID SHOULD BE TREATED SEPARATELY, WITH
                            RESERVES AGREEMENT COMPLEMENTING FOOD AID PROGRAMS. RESERVES AGREEMENT
                            WHICH EFFECTIVELY MEETS SHORT SUPPLY SITUATIONS WOULD ALSO ASSURE
                            AVAILABILITY OF QUANTITIES NEEDED FOR FOOD AID. AGREEMENT COULD ALSO
                            CONTAIN SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RESERVE HOLDING
                            RESPONSIBILITIES OF SMALLER LDCS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO RETAIN SUPPLY
                            ACCESS BENEFITS.</p>
                        <p>22. QUOTE FINALLY, THE SYSTEM MUST ENCOURAGE EXPANDED AND LIBERALIZED
                            TRADE IN GRAINS UNQUOTE. AN EFFECTIVE RESERVE SYSTEM WOULD REDUCE
                            JUSTIFICATION FOR TRADE BARRIERS IN GRAINS BY GIVING IMPORTERS GREATER
                            ASSURANCE THAT ADEQUATE SUPPLIES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN SHORT SUPPLY
                            SITUATIONS, BOTH FROM DOMESTIC STOCKS AND FROM ABROAD. INTER-AGENCY
                            AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED ON DESIRABILITY OF INCLUDING SPECIFIC TRADE
                            PROVISIONS SUCH AS THOSE PROHIBITING USE OF EXPORT CONTROLS AGAINST
                            OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN PERIODS OF SHORTAGE, PROHIBITING OR LIMITING USE
                            OF EXPORT SUBSIDIES FOR GRAINS IN PERIODS OF SURPLUS, AND REQUIRING
                            MEMBER IMPORTERS TO DRAW IMPORTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS IN TIMES OF SURPLUS.
                            AGREEMENT, PARTICULARLY TO EXTENT IT CONTAINS SUCH TRADE-RELATED
                            PROVISIONS, ALSO EVENTUALLY LIKELY TO BE LINKED WITH MTN IN GENEVA.</p>
                        <p>23. AS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO ABOVE GLOBAL APPROACH, SOME SUPPORT EXISTS
                            WITHIN USG FOR LIMITED RESERVE OF ABOUT 15 MILLION TONS. THE PURPOSE OF
                            THIS MORE LIMITED RESERVE WOULD BE TO PROTECT LDCS FROM RUN-UP IN PRICE
                            OF THEIR GRAIN IMPORTS IN TIME OF WORLD SHORTAGE. AT SUCH TIME, GRAIN
                            FROM RESERVE WOULD BE SOLD TO LDCS ON CONCESSIONAL TERMS TO OFFSET THEIR
                            ADDITIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPENDITURE. WHILE THIS WOULD AVOID MANY
                            DIFFICULTIES OF GLOBAL SYSTEM, IT WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESERVES TO
                            MEET NEEDS OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. DEVELOPED IMPORTING COUNTRIES, IN
                            PARTICULAR, WOULD FIND LITTLE INCENTIVE TO PARTICIPATE IN LIMITED
                            SYSTEM, SEEING IT ONLY AS ANOTHER FORM OF FOOD AID.</p>
                        <p>24. U.S. BEGAN EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RESERVES SYSTEM AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES
                            AT WFC. IN FEBRUARY, WE CONVENED AD HOC MEETING OF NINE OTHER MAJOR
                            CEREALS PRODUCING, CONSUMING, AND TRADING COUNTRIES AND EUROPEAN
                            COMMUNITY TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE ELEMENTS OF GRAIN RESERVES SYSTEM. MEETING
                            INCLUDED USSR, BUT NOT <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> WHICH DID NOT
                            ACCEPT INVITATION. AS RESULT OF THE U.S. INITIATIVE, WORK ON TECHNICAL
                            ASPECTS OF POSSIBLE RESERVES AGREEMENT--SUCH AS DEVELOPMENT OF OBJECTIVE
                            INDICATORS FOR SIGNALING ACQUISITION AND RELEASE OF NATIONAL
                            STOCKS--INCLUDED IN MANDATE OF INTERNATIONAL WHEAT COUNCIL (<gloss
                                target="#t_IWC1">IWC</gloss>) PREPARATORY GROUP WHICH IS EXAMINING
                            POSSIBLE BASES FOR NEW INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT. PREP GROUP
                            CONCENTRATED ON RESERVES IN ITS TWO MEETINGS TO DATE (MARCH AND MAY) AND
                            WILL REPORT PROGRESS TO NEXT REGULAR SESSION OF IWC BEGINNING JUNE 30.
                            WE EXPECT GROUP TO BE ASKED TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AND POSSIBLY PREPARE
                            FOR NEGOTIATIONS. IN THESE DISCUSSIONS, OTHER MAJOR EXPORTERS, (CANADA,
                            AUSTRALIA AND ARGENTINA) ALSO SUPPORTED RESERVES BUT TEND TOWARD
                            PRICE-ORIENTED AGREEMENT. JAPAN APPEARS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE, AND USSR
                            INDICATED INTEREST IN NEGOTIATING NEW WHEAT AGREEMENT WHICH COULD
                            INCLUDE RESERVES PROVISIONS. EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S POSITION LINKED
                            CLOSELY TO MTN AND DESCRIBED BELOW. WHILE PREP GROUP DISCUSSIONS OPEN TO
                            ALL MEMBERS OF IWC, ONLY OTHER LDC'S ATTENDING WERE INDIA AND EGYPT.
                            THEY CONCENTRATED ON PREFERENTIAL PRICES FOR LDC COMMERCIAL IMPORTS ON A
                            REGULAR BASIS, RATHER THAN ON RESERVES.</p>
                        <p>25. ALSO SINCE WFC, UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) HAS
                            OBTAINED AGREEMENT OF MOST COUNTRIES, INCLUDING U.S. (WITH SOME
                            RESERVATIONS BY <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> AND WITH USSR NOT
                            PARTICIPATING) TO A LOOSE SET OF RULES ON RESERVES KNOWN AS
                            INTERNATIONAL UNDERTAKING ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY. FAO NOW IN PROCESS OF
                            INSTITUTIONALIZING UNDERTAKING THROUGH CREATION OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON
                            WORLD FOOD SECURITY, AS RECOMMENDED BY WFC.</p>
                        <p>26. U.S. ATTEMPTING DEVELOP AGREED INTERAGENCY POSITION IN SUFFICIENT
                            DETAIL TO BEGIN SUBSTANTIVE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY COUNTRIES IN
                            NEAR FUTURE AIMED AT NEGOTIATION LATER THIS YEAR OF FORMAL RESERVE
                            SYSTEM. WE HOPE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED ON BASIC ELEMENTS
                            OF SYSTEM BY END OF YEAR TO ENABLE COUNTRIES TO BEGIN ACCUMULATING
                            RESERVES FROM COMING HARVEST.</p>
                        <p>27. TRADE LIBERALIZATION. OUR EFFORTS IN MTN TO ACHIEVE GREATER
                            LIBERALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE ALSO CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT
                            ELEMENT OF U.S. FOOD STRATEGY. OUR INTEREST IS PARTICULARLY STRONG
                            BECAUSE OF U.S. COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN AGRICULTURE. WORLD ECONOMY
                            GAINS AS WELL AS U.S. IF MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCERS ARE GIVEN GREATER
                            SCOPE. INDEED, SOLUTION TO WORLD FOOD PROBLEMS DEPENDS ON GREATER
                            EFFICIENCY AND RATIONALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. EXISTING
                            TRADE BARRIERS CONTRIBUTE TO SUBSTANTIAL DISTORTION OF WORLD
                            AGRICULTURE. WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT EC AGRICULTURAL REGIME
                            WITH ITS RELIANCE ON HIGH SUPPORT PRICES WITHOUT PRODUCTION CONTROLS,
                            AND ON EXPORT SUBSIDIES.</p>
                        <p>28. WHILE SEEKING TO NEGOTIATE LIBERALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL TRADE IN
                            THE MTN IN THE MAJOR FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
                            ON TARIFFS, AND NON-TARIFF MEASURES, PARTICULARLY SUBSIDIES AND
                            COUNTERVAILING DUTIES, WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO A SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON
                            AGRICULTURE WITH SUB-GROUPS ON GRAINS, MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS. THE EC
                            LOOKS TO THESE GROUPS TO DEVELOP STABILIZATION AGREEMENTS BUT WE WILL
                            STRESS IMPORT LIBERALIZATION.</p>
                        <p>29. THE NEGOTIATIONS ON TRADE LIBERALIZATION ALSO TO SOME EXTENT OVERLAP
                            WITH OUR EFFORTS ON GRAIN RESERVES AND HAVE LED TO DISAGREEMENT WITH THE
                            EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR ABOUT WHERE NEGOTIATIONS ON GRAINS
                            SHOULD TAKE PLACE. U.S. TAKES VIEW THAT BECAUSE PACE OF MULTILATERAL
                            TRADE NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKELY TO BE CONSIDERABLY SLOWER THAN OUR
                            PROJECTED PACE FOR NEGOTIATIONS ON RESERVES AGREEMENT, AND BECAUSE THE
                            SOVIET UNION IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE MTN BUT IS A MEMBER OF THE
                            INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT, NEGOTIATIONS ON RESERVES SHOULD BE
                            PURSUED INDEPENDENTLY IN INTERNATIONAL WHEAT COUNCIL. EC ORIGINALLY
                            INSISTED THAT RESERVES NEGOTIATIONS TAKE PLACE IN MTN IN GENEVA, BUT
                            MORE RECENTLY HAS AGREED AT LEAST TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN WORK ON
                            GRAIN RESERVES IN THE IWC IN LONDON, BUT INSISTS THAT RESULTS OF LONDON
                            DISCUSSIONS NEED TO BE FOLDED BACK INTO MTN RESULTS, SINCE THEY WISH TO
                            ASSURE ANY CONCESSIONS THEY MAY MAKE REGARDING RESERVES (I.E., HOLDING
                            MORE RESERVES) WILL BE FULLY CREDITED IN THE BROADER TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. </p>
                        <p>30. CURRENT OUTLOOK. SINCE WFC IN NOVEMBER, GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE
                            ON SECURING INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND BASIC US POLICY
                            DECISIONS NEEDED TO REACH GOAL OF OVERCOMING WORLD HUNGER. HOWEVER, AS
                            PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR FIRST SESSION OF WORLD FOOD COUNCIL JUNE 25-27
                            (COUNCIL IS 36-MEMBER, HIGH-LEVEL BODY RECOMMENDED BY WFC TO OVERSEE
                            PROGRESS ON RESOLVING FOOD PROBLEM), THERE IS DISQUIETING EVIDENCE THAT
                            INTERNATIONAL SENSE OF URGENCY IS BEGINNING TO WANE. GIVEN CURRENTLY
                            FAVORABLE U.S. AND WORLD OUTLOOK FOR COMING 1975-76 GRAIN CROP, I.E.
                            CROPS HARVESTED IN THE PERIOD JULY 1975-JUNE 1976, MOMENTUM MAY BE
                            INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. WORLD MARKET FOR BASIC FOOD
                            COMMODITIES HAS EASED CONSIDERABLY IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, AND THERE
                            HAVE BEEN WELL PUBLICIZED CANCELLATIONS OF SUPPLY CONTRACTS BY USSR, PRC
                            AND OTHERS. PRICES FOR MOST COMMODITIES HAVE DECLINED STEADILY, WITH
                            MOST IMPORTANT REDUCTIONS OCCURRING IN WHEAT AND SOYBEANS, ALTHOUGH
                            THESE HAVE NOT BEEN LARGE ENOUGH TO OFFSET ENTIRELY SPECTACULAR GAINS
                            MADE IN 1972 AND 1973. EVEN THOUGH IT IS TOO EARLY TO FORECAST WITH
                            CERTAINTY, USDA ESTIMATES WORLD GRAIN PRODUCTION IN 1975/76 SEASON
                            SHOULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THAT EVENT, PRICES COULD EASE FURTHER
                            AND SUBSTANTIAL CARRYOVER RESULT.</p>
                        <p>31. CONCLUSION. U.S. POLICY IS UNDERPINNED BY RECOGNITION THAT WE BEAR
                            SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER OF FOOD. IN
                            REMOVING DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS ON FOOD PRODUCTION AND EXPANDING OUR FOOD
                            AID SHIPMENTS, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS NOT US POLICY TO USE FOOD
                            AS A POLITICAL WEAPON. ALL DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE BEING CALLED UPON TO
                            COOPERATE IN: (1) IMPROVING INFORMATION SHARING; (2) PROMOTING GREATER
                            COORDINATION OF DOMESTIC AGRICULTURAL POLICIES; (3) ESTABLISHING FREER
                            TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES; (4) MAINTAINING GRAIN RESERVES FOR
                            USE IN YEARS OF CROP SHORTFALL, AND (5) HELPING THE POOR COUNTRIES
                            INCREASE THEIR FOOD PRODUCTION. BUT THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES CAN ONLY DO
                            SO MUCH. IT IS UP TO LDCS, BUILDING ON SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE IN
                            1960'S, TO GIVE HIGHER PRIORITY IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO
                            ACCELERATING PRESENT RATES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. OTHERWISE,
                            SPECTER OF FUTURE UNMANAGEABLE FOOD TRANSFER PROBLEM COULD BECOME
                            REALITY. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">KISSINGER</persName>

                            WORKING TO SOLVE THEIR OWN FOOD PROBLEMS. LATINS AND AFRICANS (LED BY
                            SENEGAL, GUINEA AND MEXICO, BUT ABETTED BY ALGERIAN OBSERVER DELEGATION)
                            WERE IN FOREFRONT OF DRIVE TO DEPOSE SECRETARIAT'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

                            PRODUCTION, LDC'S GENERALLY WERE DRIVING TOWARD ACTIONS WHICH DC'S
                            SHOULD TAKE FOR THEM (EXPANDED FOOD AID, CREATION OF NEW FUND FOR
                            AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND FOOD SECURITY SYSTEM). <gloss

                            INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. THE ATTACK ON HANNAH HAS SEVERELY IMPAIRED HIS

                            END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>1. THE WORLD FOOD COUNCIL, AT WHICH I REPRESENTED THE UNITED STATES, HELD
                            ITS FIRST SESSION IN ROME, JUNE 23-27. THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION SAW
                            A DRIVE BY THE GROUP OF 77 TO BRING THE COUNCIL FIRMLY UNDER <gloss
                                target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> CONTROL BY CHALLENGING THE COMPETENCE
                            OF ITS PRESENT SECRETARIAT, CALLING FOR REMOVAL OF ITS EXECUTIVE
                            DIRECTOR, JOHN HANNAH, AND SEEKING TO AUGMENT THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL
                            PRESIDENT, SAYID MAREI OF EGYPT.</p>
                        <p>2. THE 36-MEMBER COUNCIL WAS DEVISED AT LDC INSISTENCE AS A
                            MINISTERIAL-LEVEL MECHANISM TO FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORLD
                            FOOD CONFERENCE (WFC). IN SEEKING TO ESTABLISH THE COUNCIL AS QUICKLY AS
                            POSSIBLE, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> SECRETARY GENERAL WALDHEIM
                            APPOINTED JOHN HANNAH AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BECAUSE OF HIS PRIOR
                            EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPMENT WORK AND PARTICULARLY HIS ROLE AS A DEPUTY
                            SECRETARY BB GENERAL OF THE WFC. WALDHEIM HAD ALREADY ASKED HANNAH TO
                            TAKE CHARGE OF ESTABLISHING THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL
                            DEVELOPMENT (ANOTHER WFC SPIN-OFF). THIS, PLUS WALDHEIM'S FAILURE TO
                            CONSULT ADEQUATELY WITH LEADERS OF THE G-77, HAS CONVINCED MANY LDC
                            SPOKESMEN ON FOOD MATTERS THAT HANNAH'S APPOINTMENT WAS TRADED FOR A
                            U.S. PLEDGE OF SUPPORT FOR WFC FOLLOW-UP GENERALLY AND THE FUND IN
                            PARTICULAR. HANNAH, THEREFORE IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> PLACEMENT. (<persName corresp="#p_MEW2"

                            THE PROBLEM.) </p>
                        <p>3. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, TWO CONFLICTING SETS OF EXPECTATIONS
                            DEVELOPED FOR THE COUNCIL'S FIRST SESSION, CONVENED TO REVIEW THE STATUS
                            OF WFC FOLLOW-UP. THE NINE DEVELOPED COUNTRY MEMBERS GENERALLY FOLLOWED
                            THE LINE, WHICH I PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF THE U.S., THAT THE SESSION
                            SHOULD IDENTIFY GAPS, SET PRIORITIES AND PREPARE FOR A SECOND SESSION AT
                            WHICH SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE FORMULATED TO ACCELERATE
                            AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. THE TWENTY-FOUR LDC'S GENERALLY CALLED FOR
                            IMMEDIATE ACTION TO SECURE THREE-YEAR FOOD AID COMMITMENTS TOTALING TEN
                            MILLION TONS ANNUALLY, ESTABLISH THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL
                            DEVELOPMENT AND [GARBLE] SECURITY SYSTEM. THE THREE SOCIALIST MEMBERS
                            WORKED AT FANNING SPARKS INTO FLAMES FROM THEIR POSITION ON THE FENCE. </p>
                        <p>4. ALTHOUGH THE LDCS HAD NO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR ACTION WHICH THE
                            COUNCIL COULD TAKE, THEIR FRUSTRATION BOILED OVER INTO A VICIOUS ATTACK
                            ON HANNAH, PERSONALLY, WHEN THEY WERE WITHOUT INTERPRETATION FOR A LAST
                            MINUTE G-77 MEETING CALLED TO TRY TO DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COUNCIL
                            ACTION. THE ATTACK WAS LED BY RADICAL SPOKESMEN FROM SENEGAL, GUINEA AND
                            MEXICO. IT WAS JOINED BY OTHERS, INCLUDING THE USSR AND HUNGARY, BUT NOT
                            BY THE ASIAN BLOC -- WHO RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE MOST TO
                            LOSE IF THE COUNCIL SHOULD COLLAPSE. A RELATIVELY SOBER APPROACH BY THE
                            ASIANS AND A CONCILIATORY STANCE BY THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES -- WITH
                            FORTHRIGHT SUPPORT FOR HANNAH AND HIS STAFF EXPRESSED BY THE <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> AND US -- PREVENTED A BREAKDOWN.</p>
                        <p>5. BUT THE RESULTS OF THE SESSION ARE DISAPPOINTING. LITTLE PROGRESS WAS
                            MADE ON IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC ISSUES ON WHICH THE COUNCIL COULD FOCUS
                            HIGH-LEVEL ATTENTION, AND THE G-77 HAVE INSISTED ON REMOVAL OF THE
                            ENTIRE SECRETARIAT AND RESTRUCTURING THE COUNCIL WHICH WOULD ASSURE
                            THEIR POLITICAL CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE WORK. (THE DECLARATION OF THE
                            G-77, LESS ITS PREAMBLE, IS AT <gloss target="#t_Para1">PARA</gloss> 8
                            AS IT WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE REPORT OF THE COUNCIL SESSION WITHOUT
                            ADOPTION).</p>
                        <p>6. THE RESULTS OF THE SESSION HAVE SOME IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES FOR U.S.
                            POLICY:</p>
                        <p>A. CONTROL OVER MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD FOOD PROBLEM IS LIKELY
                            TO BE A DIVISIVE ISSUE AT THE UNGA SPECIAL SESSION THIS FALL. OUR
                            STRATEGY FOR CONTAINING THIS THRUST SHOULD TURN ON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN
                            ASIAN CONCERNS FOR INTERIM AID AND LONGER-TERM EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS AND
                            AFRICAN AND LATIN PREOCCUPATION WITH RECOGNITION AND A DOMINANT ROLE FOR
                            THE LDCS.</p>
                        <p>B. MAINTAINING WESTERN, PARTICULARLY U.S., INFLUENCE AT SENIOR LEVELS IN
                            THE VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DEALING WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM
                            WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN
                            LIGHT OF THE ELECTION THIS FALL OF A NEW [GARBLE]. THE CANDIDACY OF
                            DAVID HOPPER OF CANADA HAS PROBABLY SUFFERED AND A TREND TOWARD
                            POLITICALIZATION OF <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> ACCELERATED.</p>
                        <p>C. SUSTAINING U.S. LEADERSHIP ON THE FOOD ISSUE HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY
                            THE ATTACK ON HANNAH. HIS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE FOOD COUNCIL HAS BEEN
                            SEVERELY IMPAIRED, AND THE GROUP OF 77 HAS DEMANDED HIS REMOVAL BY
                            WALDHEIM IN TERMS FROM WHICH THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO RETREAT AT ANY
                            REASONABLE PRICE. BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE G-77 TOOK PAINS TO
                            CONFINE THEIR CRITICISM OF HANNAH TO THE WORLD FOOD COUNCIL AND NOT THE
                            INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOR WHICH HE ALSO HAS
                            RESPONSIBILITY. OBVIOUSLY, WE CANNOT ASSENT TO HANNAH'S SUMMARY REMOVAL,
                            BUT HE MAY ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO RESIGN OF HIS OWN ACCORD SINCE HE DID
                            NOT TAKE THE JOB ON A PERMANENT BASIS.</p>

                            CONCUR -- THAT THE U.S. CANNOT AGREE TO WALDHEIM KNUCKLING UNDER TO LDC
                            PRESSURE AND HUMILIATING HANNAH BY REMOVING HIM. RATHER, HANNAH SHOULD
                            BE ALLOWED TIME TO CONSIDER HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COUNCIL
                            SECRETARIAT CAN BE RESTORED AND, IF NECESSARY, RESIGN IN HIS OWN
                            TIME.</p>

                        <p>2. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS DIVERSION, FIRST SESSION MADE NO PROGRESS ON
                            ADOPTING RULES OF PROCEDURE AND SUCCEEDED ONLY IN REVIEWING THE PRESENT
                            WORLD FOOD SITUATION, THE STATUS OF WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
                            IN VARIOUS UN AGENCIES AND AGREEING ON SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES AND
                            SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE WORK OF THE COUNCIL. LEFT UNCLEAR WAS WHEN
                            THE COUNCIL WILL MEET AGAIN AND WHETHER IT CAN (A) ACHIEVE FUTURE
                            SUCCESS AND (B) SUSTAIN PARTICIPATION AT THE MINISTERIAL-PLENIPOTENTIARY
                            LEVEL. </p>
                        <p>3. SINCE THE WFC WAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED TO REPORT THROUGH ECOSOC IT SEEMS
                            CERTAIN SOME ASPECTS OF THE JUNE MEETING WILL BE DISCUSSED. POSITION
                            PAPER FOR ECOSOC ITEM 17 (A) WAS PREPARED PRIOR WFC MEETING AND REQUIRES
                            UPDATING. REVISED "POSITION" FOLLOWS: </p>
                        <p>(A) DESPITE JUNE 23-28 OCCURRENCES, THE DELEGATION SHOULD TAKE A POSITIVE
                            APPROACH REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THE WFC. WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE
                            DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN ORGANIZING THIS NEW HIGHLEVEL COUNCIL WE STILL
                            BELIEVE IT CAN BE USEFUL IN MONITORING THE WORLD FOOD SITUATION AND
                            RECOMMENDING ACTION WHERE NECESSARY TO EFFECT REMEDIES OR ELIMINATE GAPS
                            AND PROBLEM AREAS. </p>
                        <p>(B) THE DELEGATION MAY, HOWEVER, AS APPROPRIATE, EXPRESS REGRET THAT
                            GREATER PROGRESS WAS NOT MADE IN THE FIRST WFC SESSION. IF THE COUNCIL
                            IS TO ACHIEVE THE SUCCESS WHICH MEMBERS CLAIM THEY WISH IT TO HAVE,
                            THERE MUST BE A SHARPER FOCUS ON WHAT COUNCIL CAN REALISTICALLY DO AND
                            THE PROGRAM OF WORK ADOPTED ACCORDINGLY. </p>
                        <p>(C) THE DELEGATION SHOULD RESIST ANY EFFORT TO HAVE ECOSOC BECOME
                            INVOLVED IN CRITICISM OF WFC SECRETARIAT EMPLOYEES OR THE WAY IN WHICH
                            THEY WERE APPOINTED AND IT SHOULD OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT TO HAVE ECOSOC
                            ENDORSE REPLACEMENT OF THE SECRETARIAT OR INCREASING THE ROLE OF THE
                            COUNCIL PRESIDENT. WE BELIEVE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS WISE IN LEAVING
                            THE APPOINTMENT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THE HANDS OF
                            SECRETARY-GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_WK5">WALDHEIM</persName> AND
                            THAT SELECTION OF DR. HANNAH TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT BODY INTO BEING WAS
                            SOUND.</p>
                        <p>(D) IN EXPRESSING US HOPE THAT THE WFC WILL SOLVE ITS ORGANIZATIONAL
                            PROBLEMS AT ITS NEXT SESSION THE DELEGATION SHOULD REITERATE US SUPPORT
                            FOR THE COUNCIL AND THE KEY ROLE WE THINK IT CAN PLAY IN BRINGING HIGH
                            LEVEL ATTENTION TO SPECIFIC FOOD PROBLEMS. WE ARE PREPARED TO CONTINUE
                            OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON THE RULES OF PROCEDURE
                            AND WILL, OF COURSE, ATTEND THE SECOND WFC SESSION WHEN CONVENED. </p>
                        <p>(E) WITH REGARD TO PREPARATION FOR THE SECOND SESSION WE WOULD EXPECT THE
                            SECRETARIAT TO HOLD EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH MEMBER GOVERNMENTS AND
                            TO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE SESSION IS
                            SOUNDLY PREPARED. <lb/>

                            CAREFULLY AVOIDED ANY COMMITMENT. THE ISSUE OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION
                            OF THE WFC SECRETARIAT DID NOT EMERGE. <gloss target="#t_IFAD1"
                                >IFAD</gloss> RECEIVED GENERAL ENDORSEMENT THOUGH ONLY IRAN AND THE

                        <p>1. AS REPORTED <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">REFTEL</gloss> (A), THIS ITEM
                            WAS INTRODUCED BY WORLD FOOD COUNCIL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JOHN HANNAH WHO
                            REPORTED ON PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THE OPERATIONAL DECISIONS OF THE
                            WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE AND ON THE RECENT MEETING OF THE AD HOC WORKING
                            GROUP OF INTERESTED COUNTRIES DEALING WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
                            INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>2. REPRESENTATIVES OF 62 COUNTRIES PARTICIPATED IN THE SUBSEQUENT DEBATE
                            WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY NONCONTROVERSIAL. WITH ONLY NUANCES OF EMPHASIS,
                            ALMOST ALL SPEAKERS ACCEPTED THE NEED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY
                            ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS TO WORK TOWARD THE LONG TERM GOAL OF INCREASING
                            FOOD PRODUCTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.</p>
                        <p>3. PREDICTABLY, LDC'S CHIDED THE DEVELOPED WORLD FOR NOT ACHIEVING THE
                            WFC FOOD AID TARGET AND CALLED FOR INCREASED ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL
                            DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING RELATED AREAS SUCH AS FERTILIZER INPUTS. A
                            CONSTANT THEME, THOUGH NEVER SPELLED OUT IN DETAIL, WAS THE NEED FOR A
                            CLEARER DEFINITION OF THE WFC RESPONSIBILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION
                            TO OTHER <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> AGENCIES. THE SWEDISH
                            PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN EMERGENCY GRAIN RESERVE WAS SUPPORTED BY
                            SEVERAL SPEAKERS. OTHER LDC THEMES INCLUDED THE NEED TO SURVEY POTENTIAL
                            NEW LAND RESOURCES, MARKET ACCESS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS (A
                            PARTICULAR PET OF <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> COUNTRIES), AND
                            SUPPORT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL UNDERTAKING ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY. <gloss

                            WFC SECRETARIAT WERE RAISED ONLY BE A FEW LDC SPEAKERS. MANY SPEAKERS
                            NOTED APPROVINGLY THE CONSENSUS ACHIEVED AT THE WORLD FOOD CONFERENCE
                            AND AT THE 7TH SPECIAL SESSION AND URGED A RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
                            COMMITMENTS AGREED TO IN THOSE FORA.</p>
                        <p>4. STATEMENTS BY DC REPS REAFFIRMED THEIR CONCERN WITH THE BASIC PROBLEM
                            AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS, AND REVIEWED THE STEPS TAKEN
                            TO IMPLEMENT THESE COMMITMENTS. <gloss target="#t_EC91">EC-9</gloss>
                            SPOKESMEN QUESTIONED THE DECISION TO HOLD THE NEXT WFC SESSION IN GENEVA
                            RATHER THAN ROME. STATEMENTS BY SOVIET BLOC REPS EMPHASIZED THE
                            NECESSITY FOR INTERNAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS A
                            NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, CAREFULLY AVOIDED
                            ANY SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS FOLLOWING FROM
                            THE WFC DECISIONS, AND WOUND UP WITH THE LITANY OF DETENTE, DISARMAMENT,
                            AND NIEO. A COPY OF THE U.S. STATEMENT WAS TRANSMITTED REFTEL (B).</p>
                        <p>5. THE PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL
                            DEVELOPMENT RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT THOUGH ONLY THE U.S. AND IRAN
                            ANNOUNCED SPECIFIC INTENTIONS TO CONTRIBUTE. SEVERAL LDC SPOKESMAN
                            EXPRESSED THE DESIRE THAT THE FUND BE LOCATED IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY,
                            DURING THE DISCUSSION, MOROCCO RENEWED ITS OFFER TO HOST THE FUND AND
                            EGYPT CIRCULATED A FORMAL NOTE PROPOSING CAIRO AS THE HEADQUARTERS. EC-9
                            SPOKESMEN WERE UNANIMOUS IN SUPPORTING THE LOCATION OF THE FUND IN ROME.
                            SPECIFIC ISSUES ON THE PROPOSED FUND WERE NOT ADDRESSED DURING THIS
                            DEBATE. HOWEVER, THE DEBATE ON THIS ITEM WILL BE RESUMED FOLLOWING THE
                            MEETING OF INTERESTED GOVERNMENTS SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF OCTOBER.</p>
                        <p>6. ALMOST NONE OF THE SPEAKERS ADDRESSED THE TWO ITEMS PENDING BEFORE THE
                            30TH UNGA; I.E. RECONSTITUTION OF THE UN/<gloss target="#t_FAO1"

                            CONSIDERED WHEN THE DEBATE RESUMES LATER THIS SESSION. <persName

                        <p>1. THE WORLD FOOD COUNCIL (WFC) WILL HOLD ITS SECOND SESSION IN ROME JUNE
                            14-16. PRIOR TO THIS SESSION A PREPARATORY MEETING WILL CONVENE TO IRON
                            OUT POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION BY MINISTERS IN JUNE.
                            THE WFC'S FIRST SESSION WAS HELD IN ROME, JUNE 23-27, 1975. AT THAT
                            SESSION, A NUMBER OF CONTENTIOUS SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES CONTRIBUTED TO
                            DISARRAY IN THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS AND HELPED PREVENT AGREEMENT ON THE
                            WFC'S DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE. THE U.S. IS CONCERNED THAT POTENTIALLY
                            DIVISIVE ISSUES BE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM IN THE PREPARATORY MEETING.
                            THERE EXISTS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT THE DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE MAY
                            AGAIN BE THE FOCUS OF DISRUPTIVE DISCUSSION AT THE PREPARATORY MEETING
                            OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE WFC, SCHEDULED TO BE HELD MAY 10-14 IN

                            POINTS:</p>
                        <p>(A) U.S. IS INTERESTED IN SEEING THE WFC DEVELOP AS AN EFFECTIVE BODY,
                            AND U.S. IS CONVINCED HOST COUNTRY SHARES THIS OBJECTIVE;</p>
                        <p>(B) FIRST SESSION WFC WAS MARRED BY EXCESSIVE DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT
                            ON ESSENTIALLY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS INCLUDING DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE,
                            WHICH PREVENTED MINISTERS OR PLENIPOTENTIARIES FROM GIVING ATTENTION TO
                            COHERENT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON FOOD PROBLEMS;</p>
                        <p>(C) AD HOC WORKING GROUP ON RULES OF PROCEDURE HAS CONCLUDED ITS WORK
                            AFTER THREE SESSIONS OF EXTENDED NEGOTIATIONS AND HAS DEVELOPED TEXT OF
                            DRAFT RULES (WITH A DRAFT RESOLUTION) WHICH FORMS A GOOD COMPROMISE

                            REMOVE OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE WFC DELIBERATIONS, AND ALSO BECAUSE U.S.
                            IS CONVINCED DRAFT RULES ADEQUATELY REFLECT INTERESTS OF ALL CONCERNED

                        <p>BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>3. THE FIRST SESSION OF THE WFC ESTABLISHED AN AD HOC WORKING GROUP (WG)
                            ON THE WFC DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE WHICH MADE LITTLE PROGRESS. A SECOND
                            SESSION MET FOR ONE WEEK IN OCTOBER 1975 AND A RESUMED SECOND SESSION
                            MET IN JANUARY 1976. THE WG FINALLY AGREED IN JANUARY ON A TEXT OF DRAFT
                            RULES AND A DRAFT RESOLUTION TO BE ENDORSED BY THE WFC WHICH, UPON
                            ADOPTION BY THE <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, WILL GIVE LEGAL
                            EFFECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE. THE WG HAS
                            RECOMMENDED THAT THE DRAFT RULES BE ADOPTED AND THE DRAFT RESOLUTION BE
                            ENDORSED BY THE COUNCIL AT ITS NEXT (JUNE 14-16) SESSION. THE U.S. IS A
                            MEMBER OF THE WFC AND WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE WG.</p>
                        <p>4. THE ORIGINAL TEXT OF DRAFT RULES PREPARED BY THE WFC SECRETARIAT
                            (WFC/2) WAS GENERALLY REFLECTIVE OF RULES OF PROCEDURE FOUND IN
                            COMPARABLE UN BODIES. NEVERTHELESS, THE FIRST MEETING OF THE WG BROUGHT
                            OUT THAT (A) SOME MEMBERS WERE MORE FAMILIAR WITH <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> THAN THE UN AND, PERHAPS FOR VARYING
                            REASONS, UNWILLING TO RECOGNIZE THE WFC AS A UN ORGAN ACCOUNTABLE TO UN
                            PRINCIPLES AND RULES: (B) A NUMBER OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES
                            WERE DISPLEASED WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE UN SECRETARY-GENERAL HAD
                            APPOINTED AN AMERICAN TO HEAD THE WFC SECRETARIAT; AND (C) AS A RESULT
                            OF THE FOREGOING, THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY REPRESENTATIVES WISHED TO ALTER
                            RADICALLY THE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE WFC (E.G., BY GIVING THE
                            WFC PRESIDENT--CURRENTLY AN EGYPTIAN--RESPONSIBILITIES AND FUNCTIONS
                            WHICH PROPERLY RESIDED IN THE SECRETARIAT), AND WISHED TO AMEND THE
                            RULES OF PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS. THE PRESENT TEXT REACHED
                            AFTER EXTENDED NEGOTIATIONS CONTAINS THE TWO MAIN POINTS THE DEVELOPING
                            COUNTRIES HAD SOUGHT, NAMELY, (A) THE TITLE OF THE HEAD OF THE WFC
                            SECRETARIAT SHALL BE CHANGED FROM "EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR" TO "EXECUTIVE
                            SECRETARY" (OSTENSIBLY A DOWNGRADING OF HIS STATUS); AND (B) THE
                            "EXECUTIVE SECRETARY" SHALL BE APPOINTED FOR A FOUR-YEAR TERM BY THE UN
                            SECRETARY-GENERAL, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FAO DIRECTOR-GENERAL, AND
                            SUBJECT TO UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPROVAL (A QUALIFICATION ON THE
                            SECRETARY GENERAL'S APPOINTMENT POWER). BOTH OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE
                            FOOT-NOTED (AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE UN LEGAL COUNSEL) TO INDICATE THAT
                            THEY CANNOT HAVE LEGAL EFFECT UNTIL APPROVED BY THE UNGA. THIS IS WHY
                            THE WG ALSO PREPARED A DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR UNGA ADOPTION.</p>
                        <p>5. WHILE SEVERAL DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTICIPANTS (NOTABLY MEXICO,
                            PAKISTAN AND YUGOSLAVIA) ON THE WG SUPPORTED THE WG RESULTS, THE
                            REPRESENTATIVES OF GUINEA (CAMARA) AND GABON (LAPEBY) DISASSOCIATED
                            THEMSELVES FROM ALL OR PART OF THE RESULTS, AND INDICATED THAT THEY WILL
                            RAISE THEIR OBJECTIONS AT THE NEXT SESSION OF THE WFC. THEIR OBJECTIONS
                            SEEM TO BE THE RESULT OF UNFAMILIARITY WITH (OR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT)
                            THE APPLICABLE UN RULES AND PRINCIPLES. THAT THE CURRENT TEXT OF THE
                            DRAFT RULES AND DRAFT RESOLUTION IS GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE
                            DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS EVIDENCED BY THE SUPPORT GIVEN THOSE TEXTS IN
                            THE WG BY ITS OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRY MEMBERS (BANGLADESH, CUBA, KENYA,
                            MEXICO, PAKISTAN, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO AND YUGOSLAVIA).</p>
                        <p>6. THOUGH THE DRAFT RULES AND DRAFT RESOLUTION SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AS
                            CURRENTLY DRAFTED, THE DEPARTMENT IS CONCERNED THAT IF PRECAUTIONS ARE
                            NOT TAKEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF GUINEA (MEMBER) AND GABON (OBSERVER),OR
                            OTHERS, MAY SPEND AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF THE WFC'S TIME DISCUSSING THE
                            RULES OF PROCEDURE, AND MAY EVEN SUCCEED IN CONVINCING THE WFC TO REOPEN
                            THE SUBJECT. NEITHER RESULT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE WFC.

                        <p>SUBJECT: WORLD FOOD COUNCIL, SECOND SESSION, ROME, JUNE 14-16, 1976.</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>1. WORLD FOOD COUNCIL WILL HOLD SECOND SESSION AT MINISTERIAL LEVEL IN
                            ROME JUNE 14-16. PREPARATIONS FOR IT WERE CARRIED FORWARD BY
                            BUSINESS-LIKE PREPARATORY MEETING MAY I0-14. <gloss target="#t_USDEL1"
                                >USDEL</gloss> WILL BE JOSEPH J. SISCO, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
                            POLITICAL AFFAIRS. THIS LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION REAFFIRMS HIGH
                            IMPORTANCE ATTRIBUTED BY SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >KISSINGER</persName> TO GLOBAL FOOD PROBLEM AND US ROLE IN
                            RESOLVING IT. WHAT FOLLOWS IS AN OUTLINE OF U.S. VIEWS WHICH SHOULD BE
                            SHARED WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS IN EFFORT TO DEVELOP COMMON POSITION ON
                            DESIRED OUTCOME OF THE SESSION.</p>
                        <p>ROLE OF <gloss target="#t_WFC1"> WFC</gloss> IN U.S. VIEW</p>
                        <p>2. CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF WFC IN OUR VIEW IS TO BRING TOGETHER THE
                            DISPARATE FACETS OF THE WORLD FOOD PROBLEM. THIS CAN BEST BE DONE BY
                            DETERMINING A CENTRAL PURPOSE FOR COUNCIL ACTIVITY AND RELATING OTHER
                            FACETS OF PROBLEM TO IT. AS WE SEE IT, CENTRAL PURPOSE AND HIGHEST
                            PRIORITY IN FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS PROMOTION OF FOOD PRODUCTION IN LOW
                            INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH FOOD DEFICITS. IF
                            UPCOMING SESSION ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING MORE THAN TO DETERMINE THIS TO BE
                            COUNCIL’S CENTRAL PURPOSE, IT WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD AND OTHER
                            PRIORITIES AND FUTURE PROGRAM OF WORK WOULD BE SIMPLIFIED AND FOCUSED.
                            SUBSEQUENT SESSIONS COULD BE DEVOTED TO LINKAGE OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
                            FOOD TO PRODUCTION, SUCH AS EFFECTS OF FOOD AID ON PRODUCTION,
                            RELATIONSHIP OF RESERVE POLICY TO PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND
                            PRODUCTION, RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION, ETC. COUNCIL WOULD EXAMINE SUCH
                            RELATIONSHIPS AND IMPACT OF VARIOUS FACETS OF PROBLEM ON ULTIMATE
                            QUESTION OF PRODUCTION, RATHER THAN STUDY SUCH ASPECTS IN ISOLATION.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_WPC1">WPC</gloss> CANNOT IN OUR VIEW TAKE ON
                            FUNCTIONS OF NEGOTIATION OR DIRECTION OF ACTIONS BY OTHER INTERNATIONAL
                            AGENCIES OR GOVERNMENTS. RATHER, ITS ROLE IS TO MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT OF
                            WORLD FOOD SITUATION, IDENTIFY HIGH PRIORITY NEEDS AND GAPS, AND MAKE
                            PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO MEET THESE NEEDS.</p>

                        <p>4. WE ARE CONVINCED IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR COUNCIL TO ENDEAVOR
                            TO PRODUCE SERIES OF RESOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE LEGALISTIC IN NATURE,
                            ENCOURAGE CONFRONTATION, AND HAVE QUESTIONABLE EFFECT. RESULTS OF
                            SESSION SHOULD IN OUR VIEW BE IN FORM OF REPORT RATHER LIKE THAT OF
                                <gloss target="#t_PREPCOM1">PREPCOM</gloss>, CONTAINING ANALYSIS OF
                            CERTAIN ASPECTS OF GLOBAL PROBLEM, COUNCIL’S FINDINGS, AND
                            RECOMMENDATIONS. U.S. WOULD HAVE NO MAJOR OBJECTION, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
                            USING PREPCOM REPORT AS MODEL OF SESSION REPORT, BUT WOULD DESIRE
                            ALTERATION OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC POINTS. OUR GENERAL VIEWS OF DESIRABLE
                            OUTCOME INVOLVE THE THREE FIELDS OF FOOD PRODUCTION, FOOD AID, AND WORLD
                            FOOD SECURITY.</p>
                        <p>5. PRODUCTION. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WOULD EXPECT WFC TO
                            REAFFIRM NEED FOR ACCELERATED WORLD FOOD PRODUCTION, EMPHASIZING 4
                            PERCENT A YEAR INCREASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS WILL REQUIRE HIGH
                            ANNUAL EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL RESOURCE FLOWS FROM ALL SOURCES.
                            DEVELOPMENT OF WORKABLE CRITERIA DEALING WITH BOTH ALLOCATION AND USE OF
                            SUCH RESOURCES, INCLUDING NATIONAL POLICIES GOVERNING PRODUCTION AND
                            DISTRIBUTION, WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP. EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES IN
                            DEVELOPMENT COULD PROVIDE ENCOURAGEMENT TO INCREASED FLOW OF EXTERNAL
                            RESOURCES INCLUDING INVESTMENT. WHILE EMPHASIS ON HIGHER ASSISTANCE
                            TARGETS FOR DONORS WOULD BE OF QUESTIONABLE VALUE AND IS NOT SUPPORTED
                            BY U.S.</p>
                        <p>6. FOOD AID. TREATMENT OF FOOD AID IN PREPCOM REPORT IS ACCEPTABLE IN
                            GENERAL, THE GLOBAL FOOD AID TARGET OF 10 MILLION TONS A YEAR HAS ALMOST
                            BEEN MET THIS YEAR, BUT NEW DONORS ARE NEEDED IF TARGET IS TO BE FULLY
                            MET OR SURPASSED. (CURRENT U.S. PROGRAM AMOUNTS TO 60 PERCENT OF
                            TARGET.) NEVERTHELESS, FOOD AID MUST BE CONSIDERED TRANSITORY STOP-GAP
                            ACTIVITY WHICH IS PRESENTLY NECESSARY BUT CANNOT BE RELIED UPON
                            INDEFINITELY OR FOR GREATLY INCREASED LEVELS OF SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT
                            THE LINKAGE BETWEEN FOOD AID AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT DESERVES
                            GREATER ATTENTION. JUST AS WE HAVE TARGETS FOR FOOD AID, AND ARE
                            PREPARED TO DISCUSS CRITERIA FOR FOOD AID FLOWS, WE NEED CRITERIA FOR
                            USE OF FOOD AID TO TARGET IT ON DEVELOPMENT. WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE TO
                            COOPERATE IN MAKING FOOD AID AVAILABLE IN RESPONSE TO NEEDS, WE WILL
                            OPPOSE INCREASES IN TARGET.</p>
                        <p>7. FOOD SECURITY. PREPCOM REPORT ON FOOD SECURITY EMPHASIZES SECRETARIAT
                            PROPOSAL TO DISAGGREGATE PROBLEM AND SINGLES OUT ISSUES OF 500,000 TONS
                            INTERNATIONAL RESERVE FOR EMERGENCIES (<gloss target="#t_IRE1"
                                >IRE</gloss>) TO BE CHANNELED THROUGH <gloss target="#t_WFP1"
                                >WFP</gloss>; NATIONAL RESERVES FOR FOOD AID EMERGENCIES AIMED AT
                            EARMARKING A PERCENTAGE OF A DONOR COUNTRY'S YEAR-END GRAIN STOCKS EQUAL
                            TO 25 PERCENT MORE THAN ITS NORMAL FOOD AID PROGRAM; AND INTERNATIONAL
                            FOOD SECURITY RESERVE AMOUNTING TO 15 MILLION TONS. USG BELIEVES THAT
                            WORLD FOOD SECURITY CANNOT BE ATTAINED BY THIS APPROACH. WHILE WE HAVE
                            NO OBJECTION TO 500,000 TON TARGET FOR IRE OR USE OF WFP CHANNEL BY
                            DONORS, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO HANDLE HOST OF OUR EMERGENCY FOOD AID
                            BILATERALLY, FOR WHICH WE ANNUALLY PROVIDE ABOUT 300,000 TONS OF GRANT
                            FOOD AID. REGARDING ANNUAL EARMARKING OF GRAIN STOCKS FOR FOOD AID, USG
                            CONSIDERS THIS WOULD BE AN EXCEPTIONAL BURDEN TO BE BORNE MAINLY BY A
                            SMALL GROUP OF FOOD EXPORTERS AND, IN ANY CASE, INAPPLICABLE TO U.S.
                            PRODUCTION AND MARKETING SYSTEM. U.S. HISTORICAL RECORD OF MEETING BOTH
                            ITS COMMERCIAL AND FOOD AID EXPORT COMMITMENTS, TOGETHER WITH
                            CONTINUATION OF ITS MARKET-ORIENTED, FULL-PRODUCTION POLICY, SUPPLY BEST
                            ASSURANCE OF MEETING THESE COMMITMENTS. SECRETARIAT-RECOMMENDED SECURITY
                            RESERVE STOCKS OF 15 MILLION TONS ARE UNFORTUNATELY AIMED AT PROTECTING
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>’S ALONE AND WOULD NOT MEET WORLD
                            NEEDS IN TIME OF GLOBAL FOOD SHORTAGES. USG HAS TABLED PROPOSAL IN
                            INTERNATIONAL WHEAT COUNCIL FOR SYSTEM TO STOCK 30 MILLION TONS OF FOOD
                            GRAINS AS REQUIRED TO MEET EXPECTED FUTURE WORLD PRODUCTION SHORTFALLS.
                            SUPPORT FOR CONCEPT OF SUCH RESERVES SYSTEM TO MEET GLOBAL NEEDS WOULD
                            BE MOST USEFUL ACTION WFC COULD TAKE UNDER RUBRIC OF WORLD FOOD
                            SECURITY.</p>
                        <p>ACTION REQUESTED.</p>
                        <p>8. PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO BUILD COMMON POSITION AMONG MAJORITY OF
                            WPC MEMBERS ON FORM AND SUBSTANCE OF FINAL DOCUMENT THAT WILL EMERGE
                            FROM MEETING. GIVEN SHORT DURATION OF SESSION, IT IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT
                            TO OBTAIN AS MUCH AGREEMENT AS POSSIBLE ON A COMMON APPROACH PRIOR TO
                            THE SESSION. HENCE, EMBASSY IS REQUESTED TO DISCUSS ABOVE WITH
                            APPROPRIATE HIGH LEVEL OFFICIALS WHO PLAN ATTEND OR ARE INVOLVED IN
                            PREPARATIONS FOR WFC SESSION TO PERSUADE THEM OF U.S. VIEW. EMBASSY
                            SHOULD FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON ACTIONS WE CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT FOR
                            COUNCIL TO TAKE AND OBTAIN THEIR VIEWS ON THESE MATTERS. E.G., WHAT ARE
                            THEIR VIEWS AS TO MAJOR PURPOSE OF WFC? WHAT OUTCOME DO THEY EXPECT FROM
                            SESSION: REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, RESOLUTIONS, OR OTHER? WHAT IS
                            THEIR REACTION TO OUR VIEWS ABOVE? DEPARTMENT WOULD APPRECIATE REPORT BY

                        <p>MAINTAINING WORLDWIDE BALANCE BETWEEN FOOD AND POPULATION: IMPLICATIONS
                            FOR U.S. POLICY</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>-200 (Executive Summary) points
                            out that growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for
                            food, especially in the poorest, fastest growing <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s. While total world agricultural production could
                            expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be major problems
                            in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today's
                            poor nutrition levels, probable in many countries. The most serious
                            likelihood for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive
                            famines in certain parts of the world, according to NSSM-200. Many
                            countries will find it increasingly difficult to pay for needed food,
                            fuel, and other imports.</p>
                        <p>2. Embassy evaluations (received in 1976) of the world population crisis
                            largely substantiated the conclusions of NSSM-200, but placed even
                            greater emphasis on the significant impact of population growth on
                            unemployment and on environmental deterioration, the latter primarily a
                            result of soil erosion from inadequate or non-existent soil conservation
                            measures by traditional farmers seeking to maintain or increase food
                            production. Embassy evaluations are somewhat less concerned than
                            NSSM-200 with regard to the availability of food to meet population
                            growth in the immediate future. However, our Ambassadors see this as a
                            serious threat in the longer run, with the LDC's increasingly dependent
                            upon food imports, running deeper and deeper into debt, and unable or
                            unwilling to finance the enormous capital cost involved in adequately
                            expanding food production. This conclusion is generally confirmed by a
                            recent <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> report* which concludes
                            that, unless there is some check on population growth rates, "there
                            ultimately is no solution to the world food problem."</p>
                        <p>* Office of Economic Research, USDA, memo to the Interagency Task Force
                            on Population Policy, "Population and World Food Supplies," dated April
                            14, 1976.</p>
                        <p>3. This paper does not address the size of the anticipated growing gap
                            between food and population in certain parts of the world--a subject
                            open to considerable conflicting judgments amongst experts--but it
                            accepts that this may be a serious problem requiring actions additional
                            to those currently being taken to increase food production and lower
                            population growth rates. Also, higher incomes in other parts of the
                            world have expanded the demand for livestock products and, indirectly,
                            for grains.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has a primary concern to support efforts to maintain
                            a viable balance between food and population. We are the largest food
                            exporter of the world and, by far, the largest supplier of food
                            assistance, currently providing 12 times as much food aid as population
                            assistance. Clearly, it is in our interest as a major food and
                            population assistance donor to help ensure that: (a) our food aid has
                            maximum developmental impact; (b) it stimulates receiving countries to
                            increase their own food production (bearing in mind, of course,
                            environmental and other factors); and (c) it serves, to the extent
                            possible, to promote and not run contrary to our population policy
                            objectives. In regard to (a) and (b) above, AID has recently issued
                            instructions to its field directors and representatives regarding P.L.
                            480, Title I, as a developmental resource. Plans are also under way to
                            extend Food-for-Work programs under P.L. 480, Title II, which offer one
                            of the best ways to ensure that our food aid is directly related to
                            increasing food production in receiving countries as well as to
                            providing employment in rural areas, thereby decreasing joblessness and
                            migration to overcrowded urban areas.</p>
                        <p>5. With regard to (c), our records show that there has been a family
                            planning component to several Food-for-Work projects (e.g., in India,
                            Egypt, and Peru); and consideration, as recommended in the Interagency
                            Task Force's First Annual Report to the President, should be given to
                            expanding this approach wherever feasible.</p>
                        <p>6. But, in a broader sense, how can we make more effective use of our
                            food assistance in stimulating receiving countries to deal more
                            effectively with their population growth problems? Some countries
                            receiving our food assistance have population problems but are doing
                            little or nothing about them. If governments do not commit themselves to
                            support effective population programs, we know that very little can be
                            done on this score. Does not our food assistance provide an incentive
                            for action? Moreover, an amendment to P.L. 480, enacted in the
                            International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975, requires that
                            the President determine aid allocations on the basis of several
                            criteria, including what receiving countries are doing in the way of
                            voluntary programs to control excessive population growth.</p>
                        <p>7. It is therefore recommended that, where food production and population
                            are clearly out of balance, countries requesting U.S. food assistance,**
                            particularly Title I, be reminded forcefully and at an appropriately
                            high level during the course of working out a P.L. 480 Sales Agreement
                            of: (a) longer-term anticipated worldwide food shortages, citing <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> and other data in that connection,
                            including increased commercial demand; and (b) Congressional
                            requirements that our assistance be increasingly concentrated on
                            countries that make effective use of such assistance, including their
                            performance in improving agricultural output and nutrition and reducing
                            population growth. Such an intervention would be made by Ambassadors
                            under detailed, country-specific instructions from Washington, although
                            we would leave it to the Ambassadors to convey the message in a way that
                            would be most likely to produce effect without causing offense. It is
                            important that this message be personally conveyed by our Ambassadors to
                            levels no lower than the Foreign Minister (or the appropriate Minister
                            concerned), and hopefully to the Prime Minister or President of the
                            country requesting our food assistance, since this would also provide a
                            useful opportunity to review what that country is doing to ease the
                            food-population problem and, where required, to stimulate greater
                            attention to the food-population linkage and programs related thereto.
                            It would have the further advantage of placing receiving countries on
                            notice regarding the gravity of the longer-range food-population issue
                            and of the urgent need to take timely action. We must recognize,
                            however, that such an approach may have only limited impact since it is
                            essentially an exhortation.</p>
                        <p>** The recommendations contained in this paragraph, and generally in this
                            paper, are also applicable in the case of a country with population
                            problems which requests assistance other than food assistance, either
                            bilaterally from the U.S. or through a consortium arrangement involving
                            U.S. participation.</p>
                        <p>8. We must still consider whether the United States should go a step
                            further to draw up and publicly disclose criteria under which we would
                            provide our food assistance. Under these criteria and in the event that
                            demands for U.S. food assistance exceeded availabilities, priority
                            attention would be given to those countries implementing many or most of
                            the provisions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Food Conference
                            (Rome, 1974) and the UN Population Conference (Bucharest, 1974), the
                            only exception being where, through failure to give access to our
                            supplies, widespread starvation would otherwise ensue.</p>
                        <p>9. Arguments favoring: Such an open approach would place the world
                            community on notice that food shortages may soon occur and also provide
                            an incentive for them to carry out their commitments under the Rome and
                            Bucharest Conferences. An opposite alternative is to take no action,
                            permitting countries to scramble for our food supplies, using whatever
                            tactics or pressures they could muster; decisions would be made on the
                            basis of marketplace forces, whims of the supplier including its
                            geopolitical concerns of the moment, as well as influence peddling.
                            Aside from the inequities of this approach, it is irresponsible because
                            it does not permit us, as the principal supplier of food aid, to
                            encourage countries to observe the provisions of the Rome and Bucharest
                            Conferences.</p>
                        <p>10. Arguments opposing: We must assume that we cannot force countries to
                            control their population growth by refusing to share food unless they
                            have realistic population programs. How could we determine whether or
                            not a country was living up to its responsibility under the Rome and
                            Bucharest agreements? Some newly independent countries have not yet had
                            an opportunity to grapple seriously with population issues. Others
                            openly disavow the existence of a problem. Still others have had their
                            programs set back by the overthrow of governments. And how is
                            performance to be measured? Who is to judge? At times there could be
                            critically important political reasons for not applying criteria against
                            a country with deficient performance. Would setting forth specific
                            criteria of this nature stimulate adverse nationalistic reactions and
                            make it all the more difficult for governments to adopt population
                            programs, lest, by doing so, they would appear before the world to be
                            doing so under pressure from us? Would it not also invite LDC
                            accusations that the U.S. and certain other countries are consuming more
                            than their fair share of the world's food and that we could help more by
                            eating less meat? Laying down advertised criteria has the further
                            disadvantage of raising the question, unanswerable at this time, of what
                            priorities the United States would establish at a time when world food
                            demand exceeded supply as among friendly paying customers, paying
                            customers regarded as less than friendly (e.g., the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>), and those seeking our food on
                            concessional terms. Indeed, such criteria could ultimately lead to the
                            loss of needed flexibility in programming our food assistance and
                            increase the risk that our food aid policies would fall subject to
                            international control.</p>
                        <p>CONCLUSION </p>
                        <p>It is concluded that we should not, at least at this time, proceed beyond
                            quietly and diplomatically conveying our concern (including that of
                            Congress), as set forth in paragraph 7 above. However, in extending food
                            assistance, we should review carefully what the requesting country is
                            doing to promote economic growth, including food production, and to
                            limit population growth; and we should take into account these factors
                            in deciding the allocation of food assistance.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJWJ1">John McDonald</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_IOCMD1">IO/CMD</gloss>), Chairman of the Inter-Agency
                            United Nations Economic Committee (UNEC), opened the meeting with a
                            brief explanation of the role of UNEC as an inter-agency mechanism for
                            the development of the executive branch policy positions on general
                            economic, social and humanistic questions arising in connection with the
                            work of various United Nations bodies (see UNEC Charter attached).</p>
                        <p>The Chairman reviewed the work of the United Nations Status of Women
                            Commission which had recommended to the United Nations General Assembly
                            that it designate 1975 as International Women's Year and reviewed United
                            Nations action to date on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McDonald commended Miss Virginia Allen, Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            for Public Affairs, and her informal working group for their fine work
                            in connection with preliminary plans for International Women's Year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McDonald said that he hoped this UNEC group could accomplish the
                            following three objectives:</p>
                        <p>(1) approve the draft proposal, currently before the group, which
                            contained the U.S. response to the Secretary-General's request for our
                            views with regard to International Women's Year;</p>
                        <p>(2) develop plans for the United States observance of International
                            Women's Year and act as the coordinating point in the U.S. Government
                            for the development of those plans; and</p>
                        <p>(3) assign action for and provide clearance of all position papers for
                            the Status of Women Commission Meeting now set for January 1974.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman briefly reviewed the State Department's previous experience
                            in preparation for Human Rights Year in 1968 and World Population Year
                            scheduled for 1974. In outlining possible U.S. goals for International
                            Women's Year Mr. McDonald reviewed the U.S. position with regard to a
                            number of conventions and declarations in the field of women's rights
                            and urged that one objective for 1975 should be the ratification of some
                            of these conventions by the U.S. Senate.</p>
                        <p>Most of the hour-and-45-minute meeting was spent discussing and revising
                            the draft proposal to Secretary-General Waldheim mentioned in paragraph
                            (1) above. This document will be redone and submitted for final
                            clearance to all of the UNEC participants.</p>
                        <p>A second UNEC meeting will be held in mid-September to discuss item (2)
                            above, i.e., plans for U.S. observance of International Women's Year.
                            Mr. Haahr, <gloss target="#t_IOUNESCO1">IO/UNESCO</gloss>, also asked
                            that the next meeting be prepared to discuss recommendations which the
                            U.S. Delegation might put forward to <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss> in connection with their observance of International

                        <p>I. Significance of the International Women's Year (IWY)</p>
                        <p>IWY should be viewed as an event which marks the great contributions of
                            women by measuring current progress and setting future coals. It
                            welcomes participation by all segments of the UN community and
                            Governments for long-range effort to achieve the short range goals of
                            the Year and to build a foundation for completion of the work in the
                            decade that follows.</p>
                        <p>As an essential element in preparations for international Women's Year
                            (IWY), the Secretary General should be requested to prepare a report for
                            the consideration of Governments on what has been done by the United
                            Nations Secretariat and the Specialized Agencies to improve the status
                            of women since the establishment of the Commission on the Status of
                            Women in 1946.</p>
                        <p>Special attention should be given to the conventions and declarations
                            drafted by the Commission itself, as well as to important documents of
                            other UN elements such as the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>
                            Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination in Education, certain
                                <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> conventions and recommendations
                            bearing on women's employment, and actions to Implement <gloss

                            international Action for the Advancement of Women), which established
                            goals and minimum targets to be achieved during the Second Development

                        <p>II. Central Theme</p>
                        <p>The central theme for the Year should be based on the principles set
                            forth in the Preamble of the Declaration on the Elimination of
                            Discrimination Against Women:</p>
                        <p>"...discrimination against women is incompatible with human dignity and
                            with the welfare...of society, prevents their participation, on equal
                            terms with men, in the political, social, economic, and cultural life of
                            their countries and is an obstacle to the full development of the
                            potentialities of women in the service of their countries and of
                            humanity;...the full and complete development of a country, the welfare
                            of the world, and the cause of peace require the maximum participation
                            of women as well as men in all fields."</p>
                        <p>III. Goals</p>
                        <p>A. The following goals are suggested for the International Women's
                            Year:</p>
                        <p>1. To ensure for women equality of rights and opportunities with men in
                            all aspects of society as set forth in existing international human
                            rights instruments.</p>
                        <p>2. To ensure the full participation of women in international and
                            national life, assuring them of freedom of choice and the development of
                            individual potential, while emphasizing their contributions,
                            responsibilities, and their increasingly important role in economic,
                            social, cultural, and political development and advancement at all
                            levels--international, national and local; and</p>
                        <p>3. To increase women's participation in the development and advancement
                            of friendly relations and cooperation among states and in the
                            strengthening of world peace.</p>
                        <p>B. The following objectives are suggested for the attainment of IWY
                            goals:</p>
                        <p>1. To ensure equality of rights and opportunities for men and women:</p>

                        <p>b. Consider the needs of women who seek retraining in professional,
                            technical, or other fields in order to facilitate their upward
                            mobility.</p>
                        <p>7. Honorary degrees and awards:</p>
                        <p>Especially during IWY, encourage the awarding of honorary degrees to
                            qualified women in recognition of their achievements and outstanding
                            contributions to the education and advancement of women.</p>
                        <p>D. Establishment of national commissions:</p>
                        <p>1. A national commission, or similar body, could be established, if one
                            does not already exist, with representatives of major national voluntary
                            organizations, and where appropriate, local commissions or committees
                            also, with a mandate to evaluate and recommend the measures and
                            priorities required to ensure the full participation of women in all
                            sectors of national life:</p>
                        <p>a. Under the commission, or similar body, there might be sub-commissions
                            or working groups which would undertake fact-finding and comprehensive
                            studies, and make recommendations for action in specific areas, such
                            as:</p>
                        <p>(1) Participation of women in political life, including policy and
                            decision-making and the inclusion of women in delegations to national
                            and inter national meetings;</p>
                        <p>(2)Legal status of women;</p>
                        <p> (3)Education and training at all levels, and vocational guidance;</p>
                        <p>(4) Employment opportunities and conditions of employment (including the
                            professions);</p>
                        <p>(5) Extent of women's' participation in the labor force and their
                            positions within it, including the agricultural and service sectors of
                            the economy;</p>
                        <p>(6) Availability of health and welfare services, including family
                            planning services;</p>
                        <p>(7) Influence of scientific and technological developments on the
                            position of women;</p>
                        <p>(8) Availability of child care facilities.</p>
                        <p>2. Special attention should be given to the different needs of rural,
                            urban, and minority women in each of the areas mentioned in D-1
                            above.</p>
                        <p>3. A network of special counseling offices could be established to deal
                            with problems relating to women's rights and their participation in
                            national life, with competence also to handle complaints regarding
                            infringements of women's rights.</p>
                        <p>4. Conduct searches of positions in political and civic affairs, and
                            prepare women to hold the positions and follow up vigorous campaigns to
                            place the women.</p>
                        <p>E. Minimum targets and specific goals: </p>
                        <p>Targets and goals to be achieved should be established for the attainment
                            of the objectives of the Declaration on the Elimination of
                            Discrimination against Women, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
                            and the goals of IWY during the Second Development Decade.</p>
                        <p>F. Ratification and implementation of international instruments relating
                            to the elimination of discrimination against women.</p>
                        <p>G. The Secretary General should send continuing reminders to governments
                            of the need to place qualified women on national delegations for service
                            at international conferences.</p>
                        <p>H. Where no permanent organization exists to continue the programs
                            undertaken during IWY, consideration should be given to the
                            establishment of permanent structures to continue their work.</p>
                        <p>VI. Activities at Regional and International Levels </p>
                        <p>A. Development of dynamic programs:</p>
                        <p>1. Special efforts should be made at the regional and international
                            levels to develop action for the advancement of women.</p>
                        <p>a. Internally, within the UN itself and within each of the Specialized
                            Agencies;</p>
                        <p>b. At the regional and international governmental levels;</p>
                        <p>c. At the international and regional levels of nongovernmental
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>B. Internally, within the UN and its family of agencies:</p>
                        <p>a. What does the United Nations System do in respect to the status of
                            women?</p>
                        <p>b. What are the future plans of the system for the next planning
                            period?</p>
                        <p>c. How are the resolutions of the Commission on the Status of Women (and
                            endorsed by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>) incorporated into
                            the present and planned activities of the UN System?</p>
                        <p>d. What has the UN System done vis-à-vis hiring practices related to
                            placing woman in policy-making positions?</p>
                        <p>e. The ACC should establish a Subcommission of the Administrative
                            Committee on Coordination under the Chairmanship of the Assistant
                            Secretary General of the United Nations for Social Development and
                            Humanitarian Affairs.</p>
                        <p>f. The Commission should further request that the report of the
                            Administrative Committee on Coordination should be available for the
                            59th Session of the ECOSOC to be submitted through the Commission on the
                            Status of Women.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary General should bring to the attention of the UN System
                            the importance of increased utilization of women in the Secretariats in
                            decision-making positions, including positions which deal with matters
                            not primarily concerned with women or having special relevance for
                            women; in this connection, account should be taken of General Assembly
                            Resolution 3009 (XXVII), on placement of women in senior and other
                            professional positions by the Secretariats of organizations in the UN
                            System. </p>
                        <p>3. The UN and each of the Specialized Agencies should establish specific
                            targets to be achieved within their own programs for improving the
                            status of women in line with the recommendations of the Commission on
                            the Status of Women.</p>
                        <p>4. Establishment of machinery within the organization to ensure continued
                            progress toward goals.</p>
                        <p>a. Development within the UN itself and within each of its Specialized
                            Agencies of special machinery and the specific targets to be achieved
                            within their own Secretariats for improving the status of women by the
                            end of the Second Development Decade.</p>
                        <p>b. Continuing reminders by the UN Secretary General to UN member
                            governments of the need to include qualified women among nominees for
                            Secretariat and other UN positions so that UN goals can be met.</p>
                        <p>6. Other International Organizations at the regional level:</p>
                        <p>a. The Secretary General should request similar reports to be considered
                            in conjunction with the Report of the Administrative Committee on
                            Coordination from other non-UN affiliated intergovernmental
                            organizations (such as the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>, Arab League, etc.) to be submitted in
                            1975.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary General should focus on the interrelationship between
                            the IWY and the mid-decade review of the international development
                            strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade and,
                            specifically, should develop language designed to strengthen, elaborate,
                            and expand on the present imprecise wording of the strategy relating to
                            the "encouragement" of the "full integration of women" in the
                            development effort.</p>
                        <p>8. The 26th Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women should be
                            moved forward to 1975 in recognition of and celebration of IWY.</p>

                            <lb/>Committee on Foreign Relations <lb/>United States Senate
                            <lb/>Washington, D.C. 20510</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman;</p>
                        <p>Secretary Kissinger has asked me to reply to your letter of September 24,
                            1973 concerning the nomination of women as representatives and alternate
                            representatives to our delegation to the United Nations General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Department welcomes the expression of interest of the Foreign
                            Relations Committee on this subject. We share the view that the talents
                            of American women should be utilized at the United Nations to the
                            maximum possible extent. We are proud of the women who have served as
                            representatives or alternate representatives in the past. Women have
                            been included on all recent delegations and their contributions have
                            been considerable.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Participation Act and
                            the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations limit each nation to a
                            total of ten representatives and alternates. Each year two positions are
                            filled by members of Congress and some others are traditionally filled
                            by the Permanent United States Representative to the United Nations and
                            his principal deputies. The number of positions remaining to be filled
                            each year, therefore, is relatively small. However, l can assure the
                            committee that qualified women will not be neglected in our search for
                            distinguished Americans from varying backgrounds to fill these important
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours, <lb/>

                            Women's Year (<gloss target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>Last year, the United Nations General Assembly, acting on a
                            recommendation from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission on
                            the Status of Women, proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in
                            order "to intensify the action required to advance the status of women."
                            The United Nations invited governments to cooperate in observing the
                            year. (UN Resolution - Tab A)</p>
                        <p>2. United Nations Suggestions for International Women's Year </p>
                        <p>Earlier this year the UN Secretariat drafted a suggested program for
                            United Nations observance of International Women's Year and United
                            Nations members were asked to submit their comments on the draft. The
                            United Nations program, together with the recommendations from member
                            countries, will be considered by the UN Commission on the Status of
                            Women when it meets in New York in January 1974. (United Nations -

                        <p>(a) Informal Working Group</p>
                        <p>An informal working group, on the initiative of the Department of State,
                            was called together on February 22, 1973 to comment on the tentative
                            program of the United Nations. (Informal Working Group - Tab C)</p>
                        <p>The Informal Working Group, under the direction of Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE3">Ruth Bacon</persName>, after a series of meetings,
                            prepared a draft United States response to the United Nations suggested
                            program; henceforth called the Draft U.S. Proposal for the Observance of
                            International Women's Year.</p>
                        <p>(b) Formal Interdepartmental Committee</p>
                        <p>On August 14, 1973, Mr. J<persName corresp="#p_MJWJ1">ohn McDonald,

                        <p>After suggestions for strengthening the draft were made, the amended U.S.
                            Proposal was approved by UNEC and submitted in September by the
                            Department of State to the UN Secretary General. (U.S. Proposal for the

                        <p>4. The U.S. Center for International Women's Year - 1975 </p>
                        <p>(a) From Idea to Reality</p>
                        <p>In discussing the UN Resolution, the Informal Working Group developed the
                            idea of a U.S. Center for International Women's Year - 1975. Through the
                            leadership of <persName corresp="#p_RJ9">John Richardson,
                            Jr.</persName>, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and
                            Cultural Affairs, the Center became a reality. An initial Government
                            grant of $36,000 was made to establish and operate the Center through
                            August 31, 1974.</p>
                        <p>(b) Objectives of U.S. Center for International Women's Year </p>
                        <p>The U.S. Center, a non-partisan and non-profit operation, is entrusted
                            with the responsibility of providing information and of serving as a
                            communications channel for the observance of international Women's Year.
                            Additional functions are to coordinate and stimulate activities across
                            the United States in support of improving the status of women and to
                            encourage organizations, governing bodies, and individuals to realize,
                            as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has
                            emphasized, that "full and equal participation of women is crucial to
                            the strength of our country" especially in matters pertaining to
                            national security and foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>(c) Location of Center</p>
                        <p>The Center is located in Meridian House, off 16th Street above Florida
                            Avenue. Meridian House is a beautiful old mansion which houses several
                            organizations dealing principally with foreign visitors (<gloss
                                target="#t_COSERV1">COSERV</gloss>, THIS, and <gloss
                                target="#t_IVIS1">IVIS</gloss>). Volunteers from nongovernmental
                            organizations frequent the House and the Center should thus both benefit
                            from its surroundings and contribute to them. </p>
                        <p>(d) Staff of Center </p>
                        <p>The staff of the Center at present consists of the Director, Dr. Ruth
                            Bacon, and Staff Assistant, Yvonne A. Lewis. The staff has been making
                            contacts, assembling materials for distribution to organizations,
                            talking to groups, and working on a questionnaire to determine
                            priorities as to topics, themes and types of activities. A preliminary
                            leaflet, describing the Center, has been prepared and is being
                            distributed. ("Have you Heard? 1975 is international Women's Year" - Tab
                            F)</p>
                        <p>(e) Open House </p>
                        <p>On November 7, the Center will hold an Open House. Leaders of
                            nongovernmental organizations and government personnel are being
                            invited. </p>
                        <p>(f) Additional Funding </p>
                        <p>As a matter of principle and of good operating procedure, it would be
                            desirable to obtain additional funds from the private sector. Moreover,
                            informal understandings, common to grants of this type, virtually
                            preclude the use of any of the money for entertainment. For these
                            reasons, as well as to augment funds for publications and travel,
                            efforts will be made to obtain financial assistance from foundations,
                            nongovernmental organizations, special benefits, and government
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>(g) Enthusiastic Response</p>
                        <p> In its brief period of operation so far, the Center has found very
                            considerable public interest in International Women's Year as word of
                            the Year spreads. It is believed that without question the Center fills
                            a genuine need at this time.</p>
                        <p>5. "IWY 1975: Women in the World" Workshop</p>
                        <p>(a) An Innovation </p>
                        <p>As part of the annual National Foreign Policy Conference for Leaders of
                            Nongovernmental Organizations convened by the Bureau of Public Affairs,
                            Department of State, a workshop was held on September 18 from 2:45-4:30
                            p.m. on the topic "IWY 1975: Women in the World." The workshop was an
                            innovation. The other concurrent workshops included the five geographic
                            areas and one on international trade and finance, following the type of
                            presentation and subject matter similar to previous conferences. There
                            never had been one on the international aspects of the status of women.
                            Originally, there was doubt over how much interest there would be in
                            this workshop as compared with the workshops on topics currently making
                            the headlines. As things turned out, the workshop on women proved the
                            most popular one, so popular in fact that it was assigned the main
                            conference room. (General Information Leaflet and Registration Card -
                            Tab G)</p>
                        <p>(b) The Briefing </p>
                        <p>The agenda covered recent international meetings on the status of women
                            such as sessions of the Inter-American Commission of Women, the UN
                            Commission on the Status of Women and the UN Seminar in London on the
                            "Family in a Changing Society," as well as a discussion of the United
                            States and UN plans for International Women's Year. The agenda was not
                            completely adhered to as questions from the audience were numerous and
                            touched on many topics, including current policies of the Department of
                            State. There was so much interest in the discussion that the workshop
                            held a resumed session at 8:30 a.m. the next morning with a good
                            attendance even at that hour.</p>
                        <p>The workshop is an indication of the degree of interest among
                            nongovernmental organizations in the worldwide women's movement. Indeed
                            several persons reported that they decided to come to the conference as
                            a whole solely because of the "Women in the World" workshop. (Agenda

                        <p>6. Meetings of the United Nations Economic Committee (UNEC)</p>
                        <p>There have been two meetings of UNEC at which there have been significant
                            exchanges of ideas in plans for International Women's Year and other
                            matters relating to the status of women. This Committee has a broad
                            interdepartmental membership and its Charter was approved by the
                            Department of State on January 11, 1973 "to develop Executive Branch
                            policy positions on general economic, social, humanitarian and related
                            policy questions arising in connection with the work of appropriate
                            United Nations organizations." (Charter of UNEC - Tab I)</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Jean Picker, U.S. Representative on the United Nations Social
                            Commission, came down from New York to contribute her views.</p>
                        <p>One of the several suggestions resulting from these Meetings was the
                            probable need for a formal advisory committee of informed persons of
                            national stature to work with the concerned agencies of the Executive,
                            Branch and the IWY Center with International Women's Year - 1975. Such a
                            committee would depend for its success on high level support within the
                            Government as well as a substantial financial allocation. The idea will
                            be explored by a working group, and a special request for an advisory
                            committee may be initiated in the near future.</p>
                        <p>7. Commemorative Postage Stamp</p>
                        <p>We are hoping that the U.S. Postal Service will issue a commemorative
                            postage stamp for International Women's Year. Issuance would offer an
                            unusual opportunity to honor both the UN and women. As requests for a
                            special stamp require at least 8 months lead time, this project is
                            underway. Even though on thousand requests are made and only twelve can
                            be granted, it is significant to note that prestigious organizations
                            have already endorsed the effort through letters to the Postmaster
                            General and others are in the process of doing so. (President's

                        <p>8. Proposed Presidential Proclamation</p>
                        <p>We are, of course, counting on the issuance by President Nixon of a
                            proclamation declaring 1975 as International Women's Year in the United
                            States and asking for the cooperation of the Congress, state and local
                            officials, organizations and private citizens in observing the Year. We
                            understand that such a proclamation is normally issued no more than one
                            year in advance. We are starting work on the preparation of a draft
                            proclamation so that all will be in readiness for consideration and
                            action by the President before the meeting of the UN Commission on the
                            Status of Women in January 1974.</p>

                        <p>A growing interest in International Women's Year is now developing in
                            Congress, the various branches of the Federal Government and at the
                            private level and the Department of State would like to move ahead on a
                            coordinated plan of action for the Federal Government. We are requesting
                            each of the UNEC Department representatives to prepare for the next
                            meeting the following information with regard to <gloss target="#t_IWY1"
                                >IWY</gloss> plans for their Departments and to have with them in
                            writing, answers to the following items:</p>
                        <p>1. Selected Department goal or goals for IWY.</p>
                        <p>2. Department programs to be developed for IWY including regional
                            implementation of Federal programs.</p>
                        <p>3. Name of person responsible in each Department for program
                            implementation, liaison with IWY Center, and comment on departmental
                            mechanism to oversee the Federal program.</p>
                        <p>4. How voluntary groups can be included in the program.</p>
                        <p>5. Relevant financial considerations.</p>
                        <p>6. Suggestions for nominations to the National Advisory Board for
                            IWY.</p>
                        <p>The date for the next UNEC meeting has been set for November 21, 1973. It
                            is hoped that this will allow sufficient time for the preparation of all
                            Department action plans. The meeting will be held in Room 1105,
                            Department of State at 2:30 p.m.</p>

                        <p>MINUTES OF IWY UNEC MEETING</p>
                        <p>October 2, 1973</p>
                        <p>Mr. McDonald announced that this meeting would discuss how to structure
                            and plan for a program for IWY in 1975 and to determine an overall
                            policy for the year.</p>
                        <p>Miss <persName corresp="#p_AVR1">Virginia Allan</persName> discussed the
                            IWY workshop held at the State Department on October 18th and said that
                            she regarded the meeting a great success in terms of interest. She also
                            reported a number of national and international meetings planned by
                                <gloss target="#t_NGO1">NGO</gloss>'s for the year by such
                            organizations as <gloss target="#t_NOW1">NOW</gloss>, Women Involved and
                            the International Federation of Professional Women. Mrs. Jean Picker, US
                            Representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission on
                            Social Development suggested that the group might wish to review the
                            report of the White House Conference on International Cooperation,
                            Report of the Committee on Women, and to consider their recommendations
                            in establishing a program for the year. She suggested that efforts be
                            made to involve both the public and private sector, and that the program
                            of any advisory committee be so oriented with established priorities.
                            She explained that NGO's could be particularly helpful in this task and
                            that money was available from private sources and foundations for
                            voluntarism.</p>
                        <p>The Chairman asked whether or not there was agreement to establish a
                            national commission for the observance of International Women's Year
                            and, if so, how, to do so. A number of participants asked for
                            clarification on this subject such as the availability of budget funds
                            from State or the Department of Labor and <gloss target="#t_HEW1"
                                >HEW</gloss> for the observance of the Year. Mr. McDonald indicated
                            that the Department of State has no funds for this purpose since women's
                            programs fall under the jurisdiction of other departments of the Federal
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In asking whether the project had White House approval, Miss Allan stated
                            that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_AA5">Ann Armstrong</persName> had
                            indicated her approval of the activity but offered no money to support
                            the project. The Chairman agreed with those who offered the view that
                            this project would have to have an indication of receptivity at the
                            Cabinet or White House level if it is to succeed. It was suggested that
                            Miss Allan pursue the matter further with the White House. It was also
                            suggested that Miss Allan and Mr. McDonald arrange to discuss the matter
                            of Department of Labor participation in IWY with Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC5">Carmen Maymi</persName> of the Women's Bureau,
                            Department of Labor for a clarification of Labor's role in IWY and
                            consider the possibility of discussions with HEW to determine interest
                            and responsibility in that department of government.</p>
                        <p>The group next considered various aspects of support from the private
                            sector. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BRE3">Bacon</persName>, of the IWY
                            Center at Meridian House International, asked for additional guidance
                            and more specific details on representation from the public sector.
                            Should it be limited to UN-NGO groups only, or would it be
                            broadened?</p>
                        <p>The participants indicated a broad participation such as the League of
                            Women Voters, National Council of Women Country Women of the World,
                            religious groups such as the United Church Women; educational bodies
                            such as Association of American Colleges, international studies schools
                            Princeton, Barnard, University of Maryland; labor groups, and
                            veterans.</p>
                        <p>Action taken:</p>
                        <p>The Chairman announced that he was formalizing Miss Allan's Ad Hoc
                            Committee on IWY and asked that she prepare a draft memo proposing the
                            establishment of a National Commission for IWY using Environment,
                            Population and Human Rights year models as a guideline.</p>
                        <p>Miss Wallace was asked to check with the Department of Labor to arrange
                            to have one person designated to work full time on IWY and to see if
                            expenditures for this purpose could be included in the Labor Department
                            budget submission for 1975.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McDonald and Miss Allan will visit the Labor Department (Mrs. Maymi)
                            to ask for a clarification of Labor's role.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McDonald will seek clarification of the State Department's role with
                            regard to the observance of IWY.</p>
                        <p>Miss Good was asked to see that the November <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss> meeting include an item on IWY on their agenda. </p>
                        <p>Miss Allan and Miss Wallace were asked to provide letters from the State
                            Department and Labor Department in support of the issuance of a
                            Commemorative postal stamp for International Women's Year 1975.</p>

                        <p>Subject: International Women's Year (<gloss target="#t_IWY1"
                            >IWY</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>In response to your April 18th inquiry concerning progress on planning
                            for, and the status of the Executive Order dealing with IWY (1975), I
                            have the following to report.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations Economic Committee (<gloss target="#t_UNEC1"
                                >UNEC</gloss>), the U.S. inter-departmental committee chaired by
                            State, has considered this matter and reached a measure of agreement on
                            the wording of the Order that will establish a National Commission of 35
                            members for the Year and set goals and guidelines directed toward
                            stimulating interest in IWY across the country. The draft Order provides
                            for a Secretariat and office and conference facilities for the National
                            Commission, as has been the practice with previous "Years." The Order
                            will also recognize the National Commission's responsibility to review
                            and coordinate the work of all elements of the Federal Government, and
                            to establish a cooperative working relationship with the U.S. Center for
                            the Observance of IWY in its work with the private sector.</p>
                        <p>The draft Order establishes a budget of $500,000 for the National
                            Commission. The Department is attempting to identify $100,000 of this
                            amount in State's <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75 and 76 budgets.
                            $400,000 will have to be provided by other elements of the Executive
                            branch and the relevant line obligations identified before the Order can
                            move from State to the Office of Management and Budget. We anticipate
                            this will be done no later than July 1974. We have received informal
                            estimates of contributions that might become available from the
                            Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ($125,000) amounts of
                            $30,000 from the Departments of Interior and Agriculture. Other sources
                            for this budget would logically come from Labor, Defense, and the Civil
                            Service Commission. However, the extent of their financial contributions
                            has not been indicated. This would be an area in which your office could
                            be particularly helpful.</p>
                        <p>We have not arrived at a firm agreement on the specific area of the
                            Executive Branch in which the Secretariat should be located.</p>
                        <p>We are continuing to press within the United Nations for the passage of
                            the U.S. sponsored resolution to hold an international women's
                            conference in 1975. The matter is before the Economic and Social Council
                                (<gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>) together with a
                            resolution containing a program for the worldwide observance of IWY. The
                            Soviets have opposed both resolutions as they plan to hold an
                            international women's conference in East Berlin in 1975. However, our
                            Representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission on
                            the Status of Women, Mrs. Patricia Nutar, is now in New York at ECOSOC,
                            and we believe she will be as successful in winning approval for both
                            items as she was at the recent meeting of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>Our representatives have worked closely with the UN Secretariat, which
                            plans to fund IWY with a budget of $300,000 from within existing UN
                            resources. Our Delegation is also encouraging nongovernmental
                            organizations accredited to the UN to hold a brief conference at the
                            same time as IWY. We believe it important that their views be reflected
                            in the final Conference recommendations.</p>
                        <p>On a Federal level, interest in planning for the Year has come from women
                            representing a broad base of federally employed women who are united in
                            the objective of upgrading the status of women. The Federal Women's
                            Coordinators in each of the Federal Departments and the UNEC
                            representatives have also shared the active interest in planning. We are
                            working to broaden this interest and to develop a more extensive base of
                            active participation among other Federal agencies.</p>
                        <p>In October 1973 the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Department of state
                            granted $36,000 to Meridian House International, which created the U.S.
                            Center for the Observance of International Women's Year. I believe that
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BRE3">Ruth Bacon</persName>, the Director of
                            the Center, has been in touch with your office and provided a recent
                            briefing on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Center is developing its program with the advice of an advisory
                            group drawn from 35 nongovernmental organizations, the majority with
                            national and international affiliations. It has recently activated a
                            financial committee and a speakers bureau; and, with the help of a newly
                            recruited media consultant, is focusing on fund raising and
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>Your interest and offer of assistance are most appreciated. In this
                            regard, our major obstacle appears to be the funding of this program.
                            Your suggestions and support could be of inestimable help as we attempt
                            to cope with this problem.</p>

                            <lb/>United States Senate <lb/>Washington, D.C. 20310</p>
                        <p>Dear Senator Percy:</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the request contained in your letter of October 15, I
                            am pleased to enclose a paper detailing participation by women on United
                            States delegations to significant meetings during the last months.</p>
                        <p>We have made a concerted effort to increase the number of women on
                            delegations and I am happy to report that appreciable progress has been
                            made. During Fiscal Year 1974, 155 women served on 110 delegations. This
                            compares with 134 who served on 91 delegations in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1973 and we are determined to carry these efforts
                            forward. The progress is cumulative. More women are now working and
                            gaining experience in positions dealing with foreign affairs and this
                            should increase the number of women who can make significant
                            contributions at international meetings.</p>
                        <p>In addition to those conferences that require the Department's
                            accreditation of delegations, meetings are attended routinely at site by
                            our Permanent Representatives to international organizations. Ambassador

                            are involved on a regular basis with the work of the organizations to
                            which they are accredited and in the special meetings held at their
                            posts.</p>
                        <p>We do not have any information at hand on the number of women included on
                            delegations of other countries, but we shall endeavor to obtain it. We
                            shall, of course keep you informed. A paper giving the information you
                            requested on U.S. delegations is attached.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the above information and the attached data will prove useful
                            to you.</p>

                        <p>Enclosure: <lb/>As stated.</p>
                        <p>1. General</p>
                        <p>It is the policy of the Department of State to accredit delegations to
                            international meetings composed of the minimum number of persons
                            required to achieve U.S. objectives. Delegation numbers are selected by
                            the Office of International Conferences in consultation with those
                            Government offices and agencies having a primary interest in the
                            meeting. Selections are, of course, made on the basis of qualifications
                            and not on the basis of race, religion or sex. However, if two
                            candidates are equally qualified and one belongs to a minority or
                            special group, preference may be given to that person if necessary to
                            balance the delegation.</p>
                        <p>Although women are now found in greater number in positions dealing with
                            foreign affairs, they often tend to compete for positions dealing with
                            items of special interest to women thus limiting the availability of
                            experienced and qualified women for appointment to delegations.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this limitation, an increasing number of well-qualified
                            women are serving in senior positions or as advisers on delegations to
                            meetings, and it is expected that this trend will accelerate during the
                            coming years.</p>

                            the last twelve months in which women participated as members of U.S.

                        <p>Problem</p>
                        <p>To assign responsibility within the Executive Branch for coordinating and
                            directing the 1975 national observance of International Women's Year in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>In 1972 the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly voted a
                            resolution proclaiming 1975 as International Women's Year (<gloss
                                target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss>), (Tab C). It called on member states
                            to emphasize the following themes: </p>
                        <p>-- to promote equality between men and women,</p>
                        <p>-- to ensure the full integration of women into the "total development
                            effort" by emphasizing women's responsibilities and roles in economic,
                            social and cultural development,</p>
                        <p>-- to recognize the importance of women's contributions to the
                            development of friendly relations and cooperation among states and to
                            the strengthening of world peace.</p>
                        <p>An international conference under UN auspices is scheduled to meet in
                            Mexico City next June. IO has thus far taken the lead to assume its
                            usual responsibility for coordinating and directing US participation in
                            that conference.</p>
                        <p>Although President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> issued a
                            proclamation (Tab D) in January of this year which designated 1975 as
                            International Women's Year in the US, there is as yet no Agency or
                            individual fully in charge of what is rapidly becoming a major national
                            event. Women's organizations are responding to what they see as the
                            challenge and opportunity of International Women's Year with great
                            interest -- even intensity -- across the country. Indeed, with final
                            adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment to our Constitution almost at
                            hand, IWY has become the new rallying point for American women.</p>
                        <p>The interest being shown in IWY has in great measure been stimulated by
                            the efforts of the US Center for International Women's Year which was
                            established largely at Departmental initiative with <gloss
                                target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> funding in 1973. It is directed by a
                            former Foreign Service Officer, Miss <persName corresp="#p_BRE3">Ruth
                                Bacon</persName> and has done good work in motivating and planning
                            the observance International Women's Year across the country. </p>
                        <p>It is increasingly clear, as a recent letter (Tab B) to the Secretary
                            from Senators <persName corresp="#p_PC5">Percy</persName> and Symington
                            emphasizes, that the women's movement wishes the Federal Government to
                            establish some tangible evidence of the importance we attach to
                            International Women's Year. The Percy-Symington letter: accurately
                            reflects the strength of the feeling we have detected among women's
                            organizations in favor of the creation of a Special Assistant to the
                            Secretary of State for International Women's Year. Women's organizations
                            are fully aware that a similar position existed to coordinate national
                            observance of World Population Year In 1974, and that a National
                            Commission was established by the President as well. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MEW2">Ed Martin's</persName> recent visibility as
                            Special Assistant for the World Food Conference has reinforced the
                            intensity of the belief among women that the Federal Government -- and
                            particularly the Department of State -- need to accord equal status to
                            IWY.</p>
                        <p>Organizing for International Women's Year</p>
                        <p>While identifying the Department directly with IWY will inevitably
                            subject us to cross-currents within the women's movement, Ed Martin and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CPP1">Phil Claxton</persName> seem to have
                            weathered their respective storms and to have provided useful leadership
                            within the Federal bureaucracy and the country as a whole. For this
                            reason, and also because we see an important opportunity to enlist the
                            interests and energies of women in the process of rebuilding a national
                            consensus on foreign policy, we are presenting you with a series of
                            positive organizational options below.</p>
                        <p>While no domestic Cabinet agency has evidenced any interest in assuming
                            responsibility for national observance of IWY, $330,000 of an estimated
                            total budget of $500,000, and four positions (two each from State and
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>) , have been committed should
                            an organizational structure for the observance of the Year be created.
                            The dollar contributions come from State, <gloss target="#t_HEW1"
                                >HEW</gloss>, Justice, Interior, Commerce and Transportation. The
                            Departments of Treasury and Labor have indicated that no funds are
                            available for this purpose. Defense, <gloss target="#t_HUD1"
                            >HUD</gloss>, and Agriculture have not responded to this Department's
                            request for contributions. We that additional positions and financial
                            contributions can be elicited to support the organizational options
                            presented below.</p>
                        <p>OPTIONS:</p>
                        <p>A. National Commission operating out of the White House</p>
                        <p>1. Pro.</p>
                        <p>a. Creation of a National Commission by the President will identify the
                            Administration with an activity of great domestic interest.</p>
                        <p>b. A National Commission would be well received by women's groups which
                            will appreciate White House involvement and may resent anything less as
                            reflecting insufficient Administration interest.</p>
                        <p>c. Creating a Commission operating from the White House will help to
                            ensure effective participation and coordination of the domestic
                            observance of IWY by the Federal and State Governments and private
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>2. Con </p>
                        <p>Some women's groups may resent what appears to them to be a politicizing
                            of IWY by direct connection with the White House.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>That you sign the attached memorandum (Tab A) to the President
                            recommending that he establish a National Commission for the observance
                            of International Women's Year (the memorandum as drafted reflects our
                            preferred position with respect to the Department's own organizational
                            support for IWY; if you prefer another option among those listed below,
                            we can of course redraft the memorandum). </p>
                        <p>Approve as drafted [RSI initialed] <lb/>Disapprove as drafted
                            <lb/>Redraft <lb/>Disapprove</p>
                        <p>INTRA-DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATIONAL OPTIONS</p>
                        <p>Whether or not you choose to recommend to the President that he establish
                            a National Commission, we believe it is important to provide some
                            visible focus within the Department which can respond to the
                            increasingly intense interest women are evidencing in IWY and the
                            American preparations for the International Conference at Mexico City in
                            June.</p>
                        <p>Creating some temporary organizational unit within the Department will
                            enable us to (1) backstop the National Commission, or serve as partial
                            substitute for it in coordinating the domestic observance of IWY with US
                            participation in the International Conference and (2) enable us to
                            enlist women's interest in responding to the Secretary's own goal of
                            rebuilding a national consensus. The options are:</p>
                        <p>A. Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for IWY </p>
                        <p>Pro </p>
                        <p>This high visibility option would identify the Department most
                            effectively with an occasion of great interest to women's groups.</p>
                        <p>b. A Special Assistant would command the greatest authority to mobilize
                            Departmental resources.</p>
                        <p>c. Establishment of such a position would parallel arrangements made for
                            World Population Year and the World Food Conference; women's groups
                            attach considerable importance to according equivalent treatment to
                            IWY.</p>
                        <p>Con</p>
                        <p>a. Such a position could subject the Secretary and the Department to
                            cross-currents within the women's movement with unpredictable, but
                            potentially negative, consequences.</p>
                        <p>b. The Secretary is determined to eliminate from his office this kind of
                            ad hoc function, and is already taking steps to do so.</p>
                        <p>B. Create a "seventh-floor Task Force" headed by a Senior Coordinator,
                            with staff drawn from representatives of pertinent bureaus and offices
                            within the Department; additional representatives could be named by
                            other interested agencies. While the Task Force would be located on the
                            seventh floor, and while it might be desirable to obtain assistance and
                            guidance from you, the Task Force would not be directly identified with
                            the office of any of the Principals.</p>
                        <p>Pro</p>
                        <p>a. This option would preserve the organizational benefits of the first
                            option but without directly exposing the Secretary to anticipated
                            cross-currents within the women's movement.</p>
                        <p>b. This is probably the minimum organizational effort which the
                            Department could make and still appear responsive to women's interest in
                            WY.</p>
                        <p>Con</p>
                        <p>a. The option is bureaucratically untidy.</p>
                        <p>b. Creation of any seventh floor organizational structure will expose the
                            Department to cross-currents within the women's movement.</p>
                        <p>C. Establishing a Coordinator and Staff in IO or <gloss target="#t_PA2"
                                >PA</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Pro</p>
                        <p>To the extent that any organization within the Department serves as a
                            lightning rod for political cross-currents within the women's movement,
                            this low-visibility option would reduce the impact on the Secretary and
                            his immediate subordinates.</p>
                        <p>b. IO has considerable experience in coordinating US participation in
                            international events and would carry out its assigned responsibilities
                            re the international conference in any event; PA has some experience in
                            working with domestic groups in the context of the domestic observation
                            of IWY.</p>
                        <p>Con</p>
                        <p>a. Neither IO nor PA would have as much authority to coordinate efforts
                            with other Federal agencies, much less State Governments and private
                            organizations </p>
                        <p>D. To recommend to the President that he establish a National Commission
                            with staff operating from the White House, but to create no visible
                            organizational entity within the Department, leaving it to IO to provide
                            its usual support for international conferences.</p>
                        <p>Pro</p>
                        <p>This would reduce to a minimum the Department's exposure to political
                            cross-currents.</p>
                        <p>Con</p>
                        <p>a. Women's groups would not only interpret this as politicizing IWY but
                            would also regard inaction by the Department as a rebuff, the
                            consequences of which would almost certainly be negative.</p>
                        <p>b. The Department would be sidelined on this opportunity to surface and
                            channel women's interest in IWY in ways which would support our efforts
                            to rebuild a national consensus.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>On balance, we recommend that you authorize creation of a Task Force
                            headed by a senior Coordinator operating from the seventh floor but with
                            no direct link to S or D (recognizing however, that the coordinator may
                            look to you for guidance and assistance as required). We believe this
                            recommendation will preserve most of the benefits which the Department
                            might derive from active identification with IWY and at the same time
                            reduce to a tolerable minimum the potential political costs flowing from
                            cross-currents within the women's movement. </p>

                            National Observance of International Women's Year</p>
                        <p>I. PROBLEM </p>
                        <p>There is a need, which is increasingly pressing, for the Administration
                            to establish some mechanism to coordinate and direct the 1975 national
                            observance of International Women's Year in this country.</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND/ANALYSIS </p>
                        <p>In 1972 the United Nations proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss>) and called upon all member
                            states to conduct an appropriate program of national observance. An
                            international conference under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            auspices is scheduled to meet in Mexico City next June. </p>
                        <p>In January of this year, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in
                            the United States and called for full national observance of it,
                            including both the private and public sectors.</p>
                        <p>Interest in IWY is widespread and intense among women's groups across the
                            country. These groups are acutely aware of the extent to which the
                            Federal Government committed itself, for example, to World Population
                            Year in 1974 and are watching closely to see whether the Administration
                            makes a similar commitment to the observance of IWY. Indeed, there is
                            beginning to be some criticism of the absence of any overt preparations
                            in this regard.</p>
                        <p>I am establishing in the Department of State the position of Coordinator
                            for International Women's Year with the primary responsibility of
                            coordinating the U.S. participation in the Mexico City conference, but
                            also to maintain liaison with the UN, other governments and domestic
                            United States organizations. I anticipate that this person would have a
                            small staff, to which the Department of State and <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> have already committed four
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>I also believe that it would be desirable for you to establish a National
                            Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year 1975 for the
                            purposes outlined in the attached draft Executive Order. There is
                            considerable interest among women's organizations in the establishment
                            of such a Commission, particularly since it would be seen to parallel
                            the organizational structure established in connection with World
                            Population Year.</p>
                        <p>The Departments of State, <gloss target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss>, Justice,
                            Interior, Commerce and Transportation have committed $330,000 of an
                            estimated total budget of $500,000 for such a Commission. Other agencies
                            have been requested to contribute towards this tentative budget.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you sign the attached Executive Order establishing a
                            National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year
                            1975.</p>

                        <p>US Planning for the Observance of IWY in the United States</p>
                        <p>On January 30, 1974 the President of the United States issued a
                            proclamation calling upon all citizens of the United States, Federal
                            Government officials, educational institutions, interested groups and
                            others to begin now to work for the advancement of women. In Oct. 1973,
                            the US center for the Observance of International Women's Year was
                            organized to coordinate the voluntary US in effort in support of the
                            Year. An Executive Order directing and coordinating the Federal
                            Government effort was signed January 9, 1975. At the same time a
                            Presidential Advisory Commission of 35 persons was established to direct
                            the government program assisted by a Secretariat located at the
                            Department of State. The Commission will receive guidance from an
                            inter-departmental advisory committee composed of representatives of all
                            concerned Federal agencies. An estimated budget of $500,000 has been
                            develoed for this program.</p>
                        <p>The Presidential Commission will review and coordinate IWY activities in
                            the Federal Government and advise on those developed in the private
                            sector.</p>
                        <p>All programs will be guided by the themes and objectives established by
                            the United Nations for IWY. However, Federal Agencies have been
                            encouraged to develop individual programs according to their legislative
                            mandates.</p>
                        <p>The following examples of programs at the Federal Government level that
                            have been proposed for the Year and recently initiated may be of
                            interest but do not include all IWY activity at the Federal level.</p>

                        <p>US Center for the Observance of International Women's Year</p>
                        <p>The US Center for International Women's Year was organized in 1973 to
                            develop and coordinate voluntary programs in support of IWY and to act
                            as a clearing house for information about nongovernmental IWY activities
                            throughout the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Center has developed a calendar of US-IWY events and a schedule of US
                            activities for 1975. It has inspired the issuance of State and municipal
                            proclamations and the Presidential Proclamation and an Executive Order
                            for the observance of IWY. It has also stimulated the organization of
                            IWY committees or encouraged existing Status of Women Commissions at the
                            state or municipal level to plan for the observance of IWY in 1975.</p>

                            TO FIND AND ENLARGE UPON AREAS OF AGREEMENT RATHER THAN POLARIZING
                            COMITE. IN FACT, SINCE SECOND OF THREE MAJOR THEMES OF IWY IS THE ROLE

                            NUMBER ABOUT 1480 (148 MEMBER STATES SENDING AVERAGE DELEGATION OF TEN).
                            IN ADDITION TO THESE, <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> HAD EXPECTED

                        <p>3. HOWEVER, GONZALEZ HAD HEARD FROM AMERICAN SOURCES THAT AS MANY AS FIVE
                            TO SIX THOUSAND "UNOFFICIAL" DELEGATES WERE EXPECTED FROM U.S.,

                            INSCRIBED. SHE ADDED THAT OF COURSE MEXICO'S BORDERS WERE OPEN TO

                            WERE DETERMINED TO ATTEND.</p>
                        <p>4. COMMENT: WE STRONGLY DOUBT THAT GOM ITSELF COULD AFFORD POLITICALLY TO
                            ACT TO DISCOURAGE ATTENDANCE AT WCIWY AND ITS PARALLEL ACTIVITIES, NO
                            MATTER HOW BURDENSOME THE EVENT MAY BECOME FOR ITS BUREAUCRATS. IT IS
                            INTERESTING TO US, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS SUCH CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE
                            DISRUPTION -- OR PERHAPS SIMPLY DISTRACTION -- BY RADICAL WOMEN'S
                            GROUPS. EMBASSY WOULD APPRECIATE HAVING DEPT'S ESTIMATE ON LIKELIHOOD OF
                            "BOYCOTT" OR COUNTER-CONFERENCE BY SUCH GROUPS. IT WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE
                            CURRENT ESTIMATE ON HOW MANY NON-GOVERNMENTAL U.S. DELEGATES ARE LIKELY
                            TO SHOW UP (FIGURES OF "SEVERAL THOUSAND" SEEM TO BE BOUNCING BACK AND

                            HOSTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO. IT WILL BE THE FIRST UNITED NATIONS

                        <p>2. SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA ITEMS INCLUDE: THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF

                            DISCUSSION ON THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND THAT A
                            NEW SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER MUST FIRST BE CREATED BEFORE ATTENTION CAN
                            BE DEVOTED TO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. ALSO, THE ISSUE OF TOTAL
                            DISARMAMENT, RAISED BY THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> AT THE

                        <p>5. IN THE US VIEW WCIWY WILL PRESENT A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS AND
                            ADVANCE THE GOALS OF ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND
                            ACHIEVING THEIR FULL INTEGRATION INTO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SOLUTIONS
                            TO THE PROBLEM OF WOMEN'S UNEQUAL STATUS CANNOT WAIT UNTIL ECONOMIC AND
                            SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ARE ACHIEVED. IT WOULD BE HIGHLY REGRETTABLE AND
                            COUNTER TO THE OBJECTIVES OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR IF THE MAIN
                            PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE IS SUBORDINATED TO ANOTHER ROUND OF DEBATE ON
                            CERDS, NIEO, AND OTHER EXTRANEOUS, POLITICIZED ISSUES. WITHOUT MAKING
                            SPECIAL OVERTURE TO FOREIGN OFFICE, POSTS SHOULD, AS OPPORTUNITY
                            PRESENTS ITSELF, AND IN THE COURSE OF OTHER BUSINESS, EMPHASIZE
                            DESIRABILITY OF KEEPING WCIWY FOCUSED ON WOMEN'S ISSUES AND AVOIDING
                            DEBATE BETTER SUITED TO OTHER UN FORA. REFAIRGRAMS GIVE US POSITIONS ON

                            SOCIETY. (WE UNDERSTAND THAT EGYPT'S WILL BE HEADED BY MRS. SADAT.)</p>

                        <p>2. DEPARTMENT RECEIVED NOTE FROM MEXICAN EMBASSY (PRESUMABLY SIMILAR TO
                            NOTES DELIVERED TO OTHER INVITEES) PROPOSING CREATION OF A SMALL
                            INFORMAL NEGOTIATING GROUP, TENTATIVELY COMPOSED OF AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL,
                            U.S., FRANCE, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, INDIA, IRAN, MEXICO,
                            ROMANIA, SENEGAL, SIERRA LEONE, TUNISIA, AND <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, TO MEET IN NEW YORK TO EXAMINE FOLLOWING TOPICS
                            PERTAINING TO UPCOMING WCIWY, IN ORDER OF PRIORITY: (1) ADVISABILITY OF
                            APPROVING A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES, BASED ON DECLARATION OF CARACAS,
                            WHICH NOTE REFERS TO AS REPRESENTING LATIN AMERICAN CONSENSUS; (2) FINAL
                            OBSERVATIONS ON PROPOSED PLAN OF ACTION; (3) PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS WHICH
                            DELEGATIONS MAY BE THINKING OF PRESENTING, INDEPENDENTLY OF PLAN OF
                            ACTION OR DECLARATION. NOTE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT NEGOTIATING GROUP SHOULD
                            CONTINUE WORKING DURING CONFERENCE ITSELF. (AS MISSION IS AWARE,
                            SUGGESTED MEMBERS OF GROUP WERE ALL MEMBERS OF 23-COUNTRY CONSULTATIVE
                            COMMITTEE WHICH MET IN NEW YORK LAST MARCH.) SECOND MEXICAN NOTE
                            RECEIVED BY DEPARTMENT YESTERDAY (MAY 29) STATES ROMANIA, FRANCE,
                            SENEGAL, IRAN, SIERRA LEONE, AND TUNISIA HAD SO FAR ACCEPTED AND THAT
                            CHINA HAD ALSO INDICATED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING. NOTE SAYS JUNE 2-5
                            WERE CONTEMPLATED FOR SESSIONS OF GROUP.</p>
                        <p>3. TODAY (MAY 30) DEPARTMENT INFORMED MINISTER ROBERTO CASELLES OF
                            MEXICAN EMBASSY THAT U.S. WOULD BE PLEASED TO PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATING
                            GROUP, AS WE THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE USEFUL STEP IN ATTEMPTING TO WORK OUT
                            CERTAIN PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE OF CONFERENCE ITSELF. WITH RESPECT TO THREE
                            SUGGESTED TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION, WE CONVEYED FOLLOWING COMMENTS: </p>
                        <p>- (1) DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE DECLARATION WOULD PROBABLY BE MOST USEFUL --
                            ALBEIT PERHAPS MOST DIFFICULT -- TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION. HOWEVER, U.S.
                            COULD MAKE NO COMMITMENT THAT THIS SHOULD BE BASED ON CARACAS
                            DECLARATION (<gloss target="#t_ECLA1">ECLA</gloss> REGIONAL SEMINAR ON
                            THE INTEGRATION OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO
                            POPULATION FACTORS), SINCE U.S. HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH IT AND WOULD HAVE
                            ABSTAINED HAD THERE BEEN A VOTE. WE GAVE CASELLES A COPY OF U.S.
                            RESERVATIONS, ADDRESSED TO ESSENTIALLY PERIPHERAL REFERENCES TO CHARTER
                            OF ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES (<gloss target="#t_CERDS1"
                                >CERDS</gloss>), DISARMAMENT AND NEO-COLONIALISM, AS WELL AS TO
                            BASIC THESIS OF DECLARATION THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS PREREQUISITE
                            FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY -- OUR VIEW BEING THAT PROBLEMS OF WOMEN'S UNEQUAL
                            STATUS ARE FOUND IN COUNTRIES AT ALL STAGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
                            THAT THEIR SOLUTION IN ANY EVENT CANNOT WAIT UNTIL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
                            DEVELOPMENT IS ACHIEVED. U.S. WOULD THEREFORE FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS
                            WHATEVER SORT OF DECLARATION MIGHT BE SUITABLE. </p>
                        <p>- (2) FURTHER REVIEW OF DRAFT WORLD PLAN OF ACTION WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE
                            THAN NEGOTIATING GROUP SHOULD UNDERTAKE IN VIEW OF LENGTHY AND TECHNICAL
                            NATURE OF DOCUMENT AND FACT THAT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE HAD ALREADY
                            REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON IT. </p>
                        <p>- (3) U.S. IS UNAWARE OF RESOLUTIONS OTHER COUNTRIES MAY CONTEMPLATE
                            SUBMITTING, ALTHOUGH WE WOULD OF COURSE BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING AND
                            PERHAPS DISCUSSING WHATEVER MAY HAVE SURFACED TO DATE, E.G. SHOULD
                            MEXICO ITSELF HAVE CERTAIN PROPOSALS IN MIND. </p>
                        <p>- (4) WE ADDED GENERAL COMMENT THAT NEGOTIATING GROUP MIGHT BE ABLE TO
                            RESOLVE IN ADVANCE CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL BUT PERIPHERAL QUESTIONS SUCH
                            AS REFERENCES TO CERDS, AS U.S. HOPES THAT UNNECESSARY CONTROVERSY OVER
                            SUCH ISSUES COULD BE AVOIDED IN CONFERENCE, WHERE IT WOULD SERVE NEITHER
                            MEXICAN NOR U.S. INTERESTS. NOR WOULD IT SERVE THE MAIN INTERESTS OF THE
                            CONFERENCE ITSELF, WHICH ARE TO DEAL WITH ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION
                            AGAINST WOMEN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            RESOLUTION CONVOKING CONFERENCE. WE FELT CERTAIN THAT LANGUAGE COULD BE
                            ARRIVED AT THAT SHOULD MEET MEXICAN REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT RUNNING COUNTER
                            TO THE POSITIONS OF THE U.S. AN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, AS WAS THE CASE
                            IN CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE.</p>
                        <p>4. CASELLES SAID HE WOULD REPORT ALL THIS TO HIS GOVERNMENT.</p>
                        <p>5. DEPARTMENT HAD EARLIER CONVEYED GIST OF U.S. POSITION AS ABOVE TO
                            AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY, WHICH HAD INQUIRED ABOUT MEXICAN PROPOSAL. WITH
                            RESPECT TO AUSTRALIAN CONCERN OVER QUESTION OF MEMBERS OF CONSULTATIVE
                            GROUP WHO WERE NOT INVITED, WE RESPONDED THAT WE CONSIDERED THIS WAS
                            MEXICO'S PROBLEM, BUT THAT WE DID IN GENERAL FEEL THAT A SMALLER GROUP
                            WAS DESIRABLE AND THAT MEXICO'S SELECTION WAS REASONABLY REPRESENTATIVE.
                            AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY LATER HEARD THAT MEXICANS HAD DECIDED TO INCLUDE
                            OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT EXPRESS PARTICULAR INTEREST (E.G. CHINA) BUT
                            WITHOUT ISSUING OPEN INVITATION.</p>

                            I AM CONCERNED AT THE SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE CO-HEADS OF THE DELEGATION
                            AND WISH TO POINT OUT THAT THIS MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>2. I PARTICULARLY RECOMMEND THAT OUR DELEGATION BE HEADED BY A WOMAN AND
                            ON THIS I AM SUPPORTED BY MEMBERS OF MY STAFF WHO ARE WORKING CLOSELY
                            WITH THE SITUATION. AS I POINTED OUT IN MY TELEGRAM 4584, I UNDERSTAND
                            THAT MOST OF THE IMPORTANT COUNTRIES WILL HAVE DELEGATIONS HEADED BY
                            WOMEN. THIS SEEMS CONFIRMED BY USUN 1722 AND NUMEROUS RESPONSES TO THE
                            DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON DELEGATIONS.</p>
                        <p>3. USUN 1815 SUPPORTED OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT OUR DELEGATION BE HEADED
                            BY A WOMAN. WHILE THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STILL DOES NOT HAVE A FULL LIST
                            OF DELEGATIONS, OF THOSE RECEIVED THUS FAR ONLY THE FOLLOWING SEEM TO BE
                            HEADED BY A MAN: FINLAND, MADAGASCAR, EQUATORIAL GUINEA, SWAZILAND,
                            BOTSWANA--MOSTLY COUNTRIES THAT ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND APPARENTLY HAVE
                            NOT YET PRODUCED OUTSTANDING WOMEN LEADERS.</p>
                        <p>4. FOREIGN MINISTRY TELLS ME THAT FOLLOWING IS UPDATED LIST OF SPEAKERS
                            INSCRIBED FOR MORNING OF FRIDAY, JUNE 20:</p>

                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT UNLESS THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF KOREA
                            NAMES A MAN, THE FIRST MAN INSCRIBED TO SPEAK IN THE GENERAL DEBATE
                            WOULD BE THE U.S. DELEGATE.</p>
                        <p>5. WITH THE ABOVE IN MIND, I WISH TO REITERATE MY RECOMMENDATION THAT THE
                            TITULAR HEAD OF THE USDEL BE A WOMAN. <lb/>

                            CHARACTERIZED US DEL AS ILLEGITIMATE AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF AMERICAN
                            PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY MINORITIES. APPARENTLY THINKING THEY COULD PROVE
                            THIS ALLEGATION THEY DEMANDED THAT EACH MEMBER OF USDEL STAND UP AND
                            GIVE HIS OR HER CREDENTIALS. HUTAR ACCEPTED THIS CHALLENGE. AS EACH

                            DID SO IN ORDERLY MANNER. FORMAL STATEMENT OF CORE REP WHO TOOK MIKE
                            FIRST SEEMED ANTI-CLIMATIC. LEADERS OF MEXICAN-AMERICAN MINORITY ORGS
                            PLAYED PROMINENT ROLE BUT THEIR STATEMENTS WERE DIRECTED PRIMARILY
                            TOWARD NATIONAL ISSUES RATHER THAN TO THEMES OF WCIWY. THIS TENDENCY
                            CHARACTERIZED MANY OTHER SPEAKERS. TONE BECAME INCREASINGLY POSITIVE AS
                            SPOKESPERSON FOR UKRAINIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (BECK) RECALLING THAT HER
                            FATHER WAS ILLITERATE IMMIGRANT REMINDED CRITICS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
                            PROVIDED BY AMERICA, CHIDED THEM WITH ABUSE OF CHERISHED FREEDOM OF
                            SPEECH AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND OPPRESSION UNTIL THEY
                            HAD LIVED IN COUNTRY LIKE SOVIET UNION (LOUD APPLAUSE). THIS VIEW WAS
                            REITERATED BY <gloss target="#t_AMCIT1">AMCIT</gloss> FROM YUGOSLAVIA
                            WHOSE PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF OPPRESSION THERE COMPARED WITH FREEDOM
                            IN U.S. MADE POWERFUL IMPACT.</p>
                        <p>5. OTHER STATEMENTS REVEALED WIDE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS, E.G.,
                            COURAGEOUSLY SELF-ADMITTED LESBIAN WAS ANSWERED BY BLACK WOMAN LEADER
                            AND PROFESSOR PROMINENT IN NGO AFFAIRS WHO PROCLAIMED HER PRIDE IN BEING
                            BLACK AND A WOMAN AND A GRANDMOTHER. TOWARD END OF SESSION TWO MEXICAN
                            AND ONE SALVADORAN PARTICIPANT SPOKE, GIVING MEETING LESS PURELY
                            NATIONAL FLAVOR, AND REPS FROM MANY NGO'S PRAISED USDEL AND ITS
                            COMPOSITION. FOLLOWING SESSION WHICH LASTED THREE FULL HOURS, MANY NGO
                            REPS CONGRATULATED HUTAR AND OTHER USDEL MEMBERS ON TURNING POTENTIALLY
                            EXPLOSIVE SITUATION INTO CONSTRUCTIVE MEETING FROM WHICH U.S. GOVERNMENT
                            REPS EMERGED WITH HEIGHTENED PRESTIGE FOR WAY IN WHICH THEY CONDUCTED
                            THEMSELVES AND FOR HAVING IMPROVED RAPPORT AND UNDERSTANDING WITH
                            NON-GOVERNMENTAL SECTOR AT THIS CONFERENCE.</p>
                        <p>6. AMBASSADOR'S COMMENT: DELEGATION'S HANDLING OF INITIALLY TENSE
                            "ENCOUNTER" SITUATION WAS SUPERB, EFFECTIVELY DEFUSING COMPLAINTS OF
                            VOCAL MINORITY AND BRINGING ABOUT IN THE END A VALUABLE EXCHANGE OF
                            VIEWS AND IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING. MR. PARKER, WHO AS LEADOFF SPEAKER
                            ABSORBED MINORITY'S HEAVIEST FIRE, WAS SUPREMELY COMPOSED AND PATIENT.
                            MS. HUTAR HANDLED STREAM OF MOST DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT
                            SPEAKERS AT MICROPHONE WITH POISE AND CONFIDENCE. OTHER DELEGATES
                            OBVIOUSLY IMPRESSED ENTIRE ASSEMBLY WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS AND
                            CREDENTIALS AND THEIR CLEAR DEDICATION TO COMMON INTERESTS OF WOMEN. AS
                            NOTED ABOVE, SPECIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF DELEGATES LAFONTANT AND GJURICH
                            EFFECTIVELY DESTROYED ARGUMENT THAT DELEGATION FAILED TO INCLUDE
                            REPRESENTATION OF U.S. MINORITIES AND THEIR INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>7. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE (AND MS. HUTAR SHARES MY VIEW) THAT "ENCOUNTER"
                            SERVED A VERY USEFUL PURPOSE IN HELPING TO BRIDGE THE INEVITABLE GAP
                            BETWEEN OUR DELEGATES AND NGO REPS. INDEED, IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE AND
                            PERSUASIVE EXAMPLE OF U.S. PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY AT WORK, AND I WAS
                            DELIGHTED THAT IT OCCURRED WITHIN THE PARTICIPANTS' OWN EMBASSY. IF
                            ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE MADE, WE HOPE TO OPEN VISITORS INFORMATION CENTER
                            AGAIN NEXT WEEK TO GET-TOGETHERS OF THIS SORT IN SUPPORT OF USDEL
                            OBJECTIVES AND FULLEST POSSIBLE PRIVATE AMCIT INVOLVEMENT. <persName

                        <p>10. Conclusions </p>
                        <p>A. Appraisal of the work and accomplishments of the Conference </p>
                        <p>From the point of view of the United States the Conference, which was one
                            of the most significant human rights initiatives taken by the United
                            States in the United Nations in recent years, can be credited with a
                            substantial record of accomplishments in promoting equality and the full
                            participation of women in all aspects of political, social and economic
                            life of their nations. Its impact will be wide ranging and of growing
                            consequences in the years to come.</p>
                        <p>The adoption by consensus of a World Plan of Action, a principal US
                            objective will have the most sweeping and long-range effect since the
                            guidelines are flexible and sufficiently broad to meet the most urgent
                            needs of women in eliminating discrimination and ensuring their full
                            participation in their societies. In addition, the United States took
                            the initiative in presenting four resolutions that signaled subjects for
                            special attention which were passed with strong support of the
                            Conference participants: 1) women in development a resolution advocating
                            "impact studies" for projects to be carried out by United Nations
                            agencies similar to those used in the US bilateral AID programs through
                            the Percy Amendment; 2) education; 3) women in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> agencies and 4) women on national delegations to United
                            Nations meetings. Two other resolutions that will be of continuing
                            impact are those dealing with family planning and the full integration
                            of women in development and a resolution that establishes the
                            International Research and Training Institute for the Promotion of
                            Women.</p>
                        <p>It was inevitable that the Conference was politicized to a degree. But
                            not to such an extent that it failed to take action on women's issues.
                            There were the usual number of political resolutions that reiterated
                            familiar positions taken in other UN forums on Chile, Palestine, Panama
                            Canal, etc., which were duly registered. But the real substance of the
                            Conference dealt with women's issues and it is on these that the impact
                            of the Conference will be felt.</p>
                        <p>It was inevitable that the economic issues of the New International
                            Economic Order (<gloss target="#t_NIEO1">NIEO</gloss>) and the Charter
                            of Economic Rights and Duties of States (<gloss target="#t_CERDS1"
                                >CERDS</gloss>) were raised partly because developing countries feel
                            strongly that these are related to women's rights and partly because the
                            Government of Mexico regarded this as their price for hosting the
                            Conference. It was regretted that the United States could not support
                            the Declaration of Mexico because of references to Zionism and to the
                            CERDS and the NIEO and a few resolutions that were unsatisfactory to the
                            United States and on which the United States cast a "no" vote. However,
                            the significant fact was that the resolutions on women's issues and the
                            World Plan of Action were left substantially intact and the United
                            States was able to support them.</p>
                        <p>The US Delegation makes the following recommendations concerning the work
                            of this Conference:</p>
                        <p>1. The Government of the United States should give strong support at the
                            next General Assembly meeting to the Iranian proposal that was also
                            co-sponsored by the US for the convening of a second world conference in
                            1980 by the UN system.</p>
                        <p>2. The Delegation recommends also that the Government of the United
                            States redouble its efforts to seek rapid implementation within the UN
                            System for those resolutions introduced by the US Delegation and for
                            extensive and intensive implementation of the World Plan of Action in
                            order to maintain the US interest in this important Human Rights
                            initiative within the UN.</p>
                        <p>3. It further recommends that the Department of State bring the World
                            Plan of Action, particularly the section entitled "National Action," to
                            the attention of other Federal agencies so that they may begin now to
                            implement the world plan. It further suggested that a mechanism be
                            devised to assure a continuing review and appraisal of national progress
                            made under the plan so that a report may be available for the world
                            conference on women proposed for 1980.</p>
                        <p>4. The Department of State and the Bureau of International Organization
                            Affairs should ask the US Mission to the UN redouble its efforts to
                            encourage the UN Specialized Agencies to accelerate the rate at which
                            women are being integrated into their employment patterns and into the
                            projects and programs of the respective UN agencies.</p>
                        <p>5. The Conference has made it clear that a worldwide women's movement
                            does exist, despite varying conditions of economic and social
                            development and that this movement will become a greater force in the
                            future. Special measures should be undertaken to examine the movement
                            more carefully in the future and to attempt to harness these human
                            resources and ideas in such a way that women will no longer be
                            marginated from the decision making and development process that will
                            shape the future. It is essential that the US permit itself to be
                            identified with this important Human Rights initiative increasingly in
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>6. It must be recognized that one of the major resources awaiting
                            development are the women of the third world. Policy makers, at present
                            primarily male, assume that the issue is "women's liberation," and
                            therefore culturally imperialistic. It is neither. The issue is how to
                            enable all people to be more productive in order to reduce poverty.</p>
                        <p>7. The US Government should continue to press the view that equality and
                            development are interrelated and therefore indivisible for women. It
                            must continue to reject Third World claims that national development
                            problems need to be solved before women's lives can be improved. This
                            argument ignores the fact that women's work is part of the solution to
                            this pressing world problem. The work of the World Conference supports
                            this conclusion.</p>

                        <p>1. FOLLOWING IS MY EVALUATION OF IWY CONFERENCE, BASED ON PARTICIPATION
                            IN ALL BUT THE FIRST THREE DAYS. ON BALANCE I THINK THE CONFERENCE HAS
                            TO ITS CREDIT SUBSTANTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN PROMOTING EQUALITY AND FULL
                            PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN, AND THAT ITS IMPACT WILL BE WIDE-RANGING.</p>
                        <p>2. THE CONFERENCE MADE CLEAR BEYOND DOUBT THAT THERE IS A WORLD-WIDE
                            WOMEN'S MOVEMENT WHICH, DESPITE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES OF OUTLOOK DUE TO
                            VARYING CONDITIONS WORLDWIDE, STILL HAS A COMMON BASE OF ASPIRATION AND
                            DETERMINATION. WHILE THE CONFERENCE PAID ATTENTION TO THE "TRADITIONAL"
                            WOMEN'S ISSUES OF LEGAL EQUALITY AND SOCIAL SERVICES, IT FOCUSED TO A
                            VERY CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ON "CONTEMPORARY" ISSUES, I.E. ATTITUDES (THE
                            EXTENT TO WHICH THE MEDIA AND SOCIETY ITSELF SHAPE ATTITUDES TOWARD
                            WOMEN); ROLES (THE NECESSITY FOR ELIMINATING SIMPLISTIC STEREOTYPES OF
                            WHAT ARE APPROPRIATE ROLES FOR MEN AND WOMEN); AND THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO
                            BE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN TODAY'S WORLD. DELEGATES FROM THE DEVELOPING
                            COUNTRIES STRESSED THESE THEMES JUST AS STRONGLY AS DID THOSE FROM THE
                            DEVELOPED ONES.</p>
                        <p>3. THE US ACHIEVED ITS PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE: PASSAGE OF A WORLD PLAN OF
                            ACTION THAT WILL SERVE AS A GENERAL GUIDE, TO BE ADAPTED COUNTRY BY
                            COUNTRY, TO ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND ENSURING THEIR
                            FULL PARTICIPATION IN THEIR SOCIETIES.</p>
                        <p>4. THE US ALSO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN PRESENTING FOUR RESOLUTIONS, TO
                            SIGNAL SUBJECTS FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION. ATTEMPTS TO POLITICIZE SOME OF
                            THESE WERE SIDETRACKED, AND ALL FOUR PASSED WITH STRONG SUPPORT. THEY
                            WERE WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT (ADVOCATING TECHNIQUES FOR UN AGENCIES SIMILAR
                            TO THOSE USED IN OUR BILATERAL AID PROGRAMS THROUGH THE PERCY
                            AMENDMENT); EDUCATION; WOMEN IN UN AGENCIES AND WOMEN ON NATIONAL
                            DELEGATIONS TO UN MEETINGS.</p>
                        <p>5. AS WAS INEVITABLE, THE CONFERENCE WAS POLITICIZED TO A DEGREE. BUT NOT
                            TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT FAILED TO TAKE ACTION ON THE WOMEN'S ISSUES.
                            THERE WERE A HALF DOZEN STRICTLY POLITICAL RESOLUTIONS (ON SUCH SUBJECTS
                            AS CHILE, PALESTINE, PANAMA CANAL) WHICH REITERATED FAMILIAR POSITIONS
                            TAKEN IN OTHER UN FORUMS. THE THIRD WORLD WENT THROUGH THE MOTIONS AND
                            WELL-KNOWN VIEWS (THEIRS AND OURS) WERE DULY REGISTERED. BUT THE REAL
                            SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE DEALT WITH WOMEN'S ISSUES, AND IT IS ON
                            THESE THAT THE IMPACT OF THE CONFERENCE WILL BE FELT.</p>
                        <p>6. SINCE MEXICO CITY IS THE HOME OF A GOOD NUMBER OF CHILEAN REFUGEES,
                            CHILE GOT CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION. THE CHILEAN DELEGATION HAD SOME
                            DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCES IN PUBLIC ENCOUNTERS AND ALLENDE'S WIDOW SPOKE
                            AT THE TRIBUNE. THE DISCUSSION OF THE RESOLUTION ON CHILE AT THE
                            CONFERENCE, HOWEVER, WAS NOT EXCESSIVE AND, THANKS TO EFFORTS OF THE
                            LATIN AMERICANS, THE RESOLUTION WAS WORDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE
                            CHILEAN DELEGATION DID NOT OPPOSE ITS ADOPTION BY CONSENSUS. WHILE I DO
                            NOT KNOW WHAT PRECIPITATED CHILE'S DECISION TO BAR THE UN INVESTIGATING
                            GROUP, I DOUBT THAT IT WAS DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUE AT MEXICO CITY.
                            INDEED, SEVERAL LATIN DELEGATES REFERRED FAVORABLY TO CHILE'S
                            WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE GROUP AS EVIDENCE OF HER OPENNESS AND
                            COOPERATION.</p>
                        <p>7. IT WAS ALSO INEVITABLE THAT THE ECONOMIC ISSUES OF THE <gloss
                                target="#t_NIEO1">NIEO</gloss> AND <gloss target="#t_CERDS1"
                                >CERDS</gloss> WOULD BE RAISED --IN PART BECAUSE THE DEVELOPING
                            COUNTRIES FEEL STRONGLY THAT THESE ARE RELATED TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS, IN
                            PART BECAUSE PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_EAL1">ECHEVERRIA</persName>
                            WAS DETERMINED TO EXACT HIS PRICE AS HOST TO THE CONFERENCE. AGAIN, A DE
                            FACTO COMPROMISE EMERGED. THE SUBSTANTIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE
                            CONFERENCE--THE PLAN OF ACTION AND THE RESOLUTIONS ON WOMEN'S
                            ISSUES--WERE LEFT SUFFICIENTLY INTACT THAT WE COULD SUPPORT THEM; THE
                            DECLARATION AND A FEW OF THE RESOLUTIONS WERE UNSATISFACTORY TO US AND
                            ACCORDINGLY WE VOTED NO.</p>
                        <p>8. OUR "NO" VOTE ON THE DECLARATION WAS BASED ON UNACCEPTABLE REFERENCES
                            TO ZIONISM AND TO THE CERDS AND NIEO. THE <gloss target="#t_G771"
                                >G-77</gloss> DRAFTED THE DECLARATION AND DESPITE REPEATED REQUESTS
                            FROM US WERE NEVER WILLING TO NEGOTIATE LANGUAGE. AND GIVEN ECHEVERRIA'S
                            PERSONAL CAMPAIGN ON CERDS, I DOUBT THAT MEXICO WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
                            LANGUAGE THAT WE COULD LIVE WITH. WHILE REGRETTABLE, THAT THE "NO" VOTE
                            WAS NECESSARY, AND PARTICULARLY UNFORTUNATE THAT WE WERE ISOLATED IN
                            COMPANY ONLY WITH ISRAEL, I DO NOT CONSIDER IT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO
                            THE OUTCOME OF THE CONFERENCE. WE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT TO REGISTER OUR
                            VIEWS IN THE MOST TELLING WAY--BY OUR VOTE. THIS HAS NO EFFECT ON THE
                            CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIONS WE PLAN TO TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN OF ACTION AND
                            RESOLUTIONS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES. THE US EMPHASIS THROUGHOUT THE CONFERENCE
                            WAS NOT ON RHETORIC, BUT RATHER ON PRACTICAL STEPS TO ADVANCE THE STATUS
                            OF WOMEN.</p>
                        <p>9. MOST OF THE RESOLUTIONS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES WERE VERY GOOD FROM OUR
                            POINT OF VIEW. THEY STRESSED MANY OF THE ISSUES TO WHICH WE GIVE
                            PRIORITY IN OUR BILATERAL AID PROGRAMS; HEALTH, EDUCATION,
                            FAMILY-PLANNING, SELF-HELP, INTEGRATION OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT,
                            CONSIDERATION OF SOCIAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC FACTORS IN DEVELOPMENT. THE
                            CONFERENCE DID, AS WE HOPED AND URGED, GIVE PRIORITY TO THE THEME OF
                            WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>10. WHILE THE PARALLEL <gloss target="#t_NGO1">NGO</gloss> CONFERENCE,
                            THE "TRIBUNE," OCCASIONED SOME OF THE NEGATIVE PRESS REPORTING, IT
                            PLAYED AN ESSENTIAL PART. IN ADDITION TO THE FRINGE GROUPS THAT DREW SO
                            MUCH ATTENTION, THERE WERE IMPORTANT WOMEN LEADERS FROM MAINSTREAM
                            ORGANIZATIONS. MANY WOMEN'S ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED IN DEPTH AT THE
                            TRIBUNE TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN WAS POSSIBLE AT THE GOVERNMENTAL
                            CONFERENCE. AND THE PARTICIPANTS WILL SUPPLY ESSENTIAL FOLLOW-THROUGH
                            WITH GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY RETURN HOME. AS AT THE BUCHAREST AND ROME
                            CONFERENCES, THE NGO PARTICIPATION PROVIDED AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT.</p>
                        <p>11. MY BASICALLY POSITIVE EVALUATION STEMS FROM WHAT I THINK THE RESULTS
                            OF THE CONFERENCE ARE LIKELY TO BE. THE POLITICAL RESOLUTIONS AND THE
                            STATEMENTS ON CERDS/NIE0 ARE ONLY ONE MORE CHAPTER IN BATTLES THAT ARE
                            BEING WAGED MORE APPROPRIATELY ELSEWHERE. THEY ADDED LITTLE TO THE
                            ONGOING ARGUMENTS IN OTHER FORUMS. BUT THE PLAN OF ACTION AND THE
                            RESOLUTIONS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES--TOGETHER WITH THE CATALYTIC EFFECT OF THE
                            CONFERENCE--WILL I BELIEVE SET IN MOTION SOME SIGNIFICANT STEPS. WE KNOW
                            THAT UN RESOLUTIONS CAN MEAN NOTHING, IF IGNORED, OR A GREAT DEAL IF
                            THOSE WITH THE POWER TO DO SO DECIDE TO CARRY THEM OUT. IN ALL THE UN
                            MEETINGS I HAVE ATTENDED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, I HEARD MORE TALK
                            DURING THIS CONFERENCE THAN IN ANY OTHER OF WHAT PEOPLE--BOTH
                            GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL--INTEND TO DO WHEN THEY GET HOME. IN
                            THIS SENSE I THINK THAT THE CONFERENCE WILL PROVE TO HAVE ITS IMPACT.

                        <p>UNITED NATIONS WORLD CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S
                            YEAR<lb/>MEXICO CITY, JUNE 19-JULY 2, 1975</p>
                        <p>Modeled on a similar type of forum at the 1974 World Population
                            Conference, an International Committee of the Conference of
                            Non-governmental Organizations in Consultative Status with the United
                            Nations Economic and Social Council organized a non-governmental Tribune
                            to run concurrently with the inter-governmental World Conference of
                                <gloss target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss> at Mexico City, June 19-July 2,
                            1975.</p>
                        <p>Open to the participation of all interested people, the Tribune's agenda
                            centered on the IWY themes of equality, development and peace and the
                            multiplicity of issues involved in these themes.</p>
                        <p>A formal, structured program was scheduled daily through June 27,
                            consisting of morning and afternoon panel discussions covering a wide
                            range of subjects. "Women Across Cultures", "Attitude Formation and
                            Socialization Processes", "Law and the Status of Women", "Population and
                            Planned Parenthood", "Peace and Disarmament", were among the subjects
                            scheduled for Conference Rooms One and Two which could seat up to 3000
                            and 1000 persons. No formal sessions were scheduled for discussions on
                            the World Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>Daily briefings on the proceedings of the inter-governmental conference
                            were scheduled each morning. In addition, smaller rooms at the Tribune
                            site were allocated daily for ad hoc meetings at the request of
                            individuals and groups on a first request, first scheduled basis.</p>
                        <p>The subjects discussed at these ad hoc meetings were varied as the
                            interests of the 5,000 Tribune participants. On a given day, for
                            example, meeting rooms were allocated for discussions on "Feminist
                            Health Centers", "Cross Cultural Consideration on Replacing Male
                            Dominant Language Elements", "The Chicano Struggle for Justice", "The
                            National Gay Task Force Report", "Women and the Church", "Education in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>", and "The Right to Abortion".
                            Attendance at the Sessions varied from 30-40 to standing room only.</p>
                        <p>The organizers of the Tribune stressed that the Tribune itself had no
                            political position and would not issue any statement of principles.
                            Individuals and groups could make statements, but not in the Tribune's
                            name.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning it became increasingly evident that the structure of
                            the Tribune as well as the distance between the official conference and
                            the Tribune, a distance both of geography as well as of spirit, did not
                            allow for any direct input of the Tribune participants into the
                            deliberations of the Conference delegates. The frustrations arising from
                            this lack of communication as well as the failure of the Tribune to
                            provide opportunity for discussion of the World Plan of Action led to
                            the formation of "speakout" sessions open to all Tribune members who
                            wished to discuss the contents and implementation of the World Plan of
                            Action.</p>
                        <p>A core of activists, sparked by American women but representing such
                            diverse countries as Nigeria, Australia, Japan, Argentina, India,
                            Bermuda, Mexico and Sri Lanka, formed a steering committee to consider
                            necessary revisions to the World Plan of Action, the centerpiece of
                            discussion and activity in Committee One of the official Conference. The
                            first "speakout" session got off to a shaky start on Monday, June 23. In
                            fact, it almost didn't come off at all as rooms had been allocated on
                            the previous Saturday. Negotiations with the Tribune management resulted
                            in borrowing a room allocated to the United Nations Association from
                            1:30-3:30 p.m., the time Senator <persName corresp="#p_PC5">Charles
                                Percy</persName> was chairing a panel on Women and Development at
                            the Tribune. A telling point in the negotiations for the room was the
                            argument that the speakout might help to divert from Senator Percy's
                            panel confrontation of the type that marked a meeting of American
                            non-governmental organizations with the American delegation at the
                            American Embassy on the previous Saturday morning.</p>
                        <p>The presentation of ground rules for the speak-out drawn up by the
                            steering committee set off the first outcry from a small group of
                            dissidents similar to that which had loudly confronted the American
                            delegation at the Saturday Embassy meeting. Ms. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FB3">Betty Friedan</persName> speaking for the steering
                            committee urged that participants stick to concrete issues of concern to
                            women of all countries rather than airing the "internal dirty linen" of
                            their own countries. Regrettably, for the next hour and a half
                            constructive group discussion was periodically interrupted by a series
                            of orchestrated harangues by Americans on "American Imperialism",
                            freedom from U.S. oppression in Puerto Rico and Panama, assertions of
                            the unrepresentative nature of the American delegation, etc.</p>
                        <p>Undaunted by the discouraging setback of its first session, the steering
                            committee met throughout Monday night. It appointed chairmen for 9 open
                            and representative task forces to draft revisions and additions to the
                            specific areas of the World Plan of Action. The task forces which had
                            participation from all continents met throughout Tuesday and well into
                            Tuesday night to consider the World Plan of Action item by item.</p>
                        <p>In a truly extraordinary session on Wednesday from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. the
                            suggested changes were presented in Conference Room One to over 2000
                            persons. The meeting was firmly and fairly chaired in succession by
                            women from the nine countries. The chairman of each task force presented
                            recommended revisions and amendments to the various substantive sections
                            of the Plan. Floor comment and questions were stringently kept to the
                            subject at hand by the chairpersons. In short of two hours the suggested
                            changes to the <gloss target="#t_WPA1">WPA</gloss> were discussed and
                            approved by the 2000 participants.</p>
                        <p>Calling themselves the Voice of the United Women of the Tribune, a
                            committee called on Ms. Helvi <persName corresp="#p_SH4"
                                >Sipila</persName>, Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> IWY Conference, Thursday morning to present her with
                            copies of the revisions including those representing the views of the
                            Latin American feminist coalition and to request 10 minutes of Plenary
                            time to present the revisions to the official delegates. Ms. Sipila
                            agreed to take the request in hand and accepted an invitation to respond
                            to the Friday lunch time speakout session.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, the course of the speakout was never destined to run smoothly. A
                            noisy and increasingly ominous demonstration, much publicized by the
                            world media, marred the opening of the Friday session. As the over 3000
                            women awaited the arrival of Ms. Sipila, a group of some 50
                            Spanish-speaking women of different nationalities insisted that they had
                            not seen one of the copies, which were unfortunately limited in number,
                            of the original revisions. They loudly protested that they could not
                            accept the revisions. Unfortunately, their clamor drowned out an
                            announcement that the U.S. Embassy was at that very moment printing 5000
                            copies in English and Spanish of the edited revisions for distribution
                            at the Tribune, and at the Inter-Governmental Conference, so that
                            delegates could take home with them a record of their achievement.</p>
                        <p>Appended to this printed copy of the revisions and amendments was a
                            summary of the positions taken be a coalition of Latin American women
                            representing all Central and South American countries present at the
                            Tribune.</p>
                        <p>The intervention of a well-known Mexican feminist leader who called for
                            calmness and reason to prevail finally quieted the demonstration in time
                            for Ms. Sipila's arrival. A press conference devoted to explaining the
                            revisions to the media, which immediately followed her speech, had to be
                            cancelled due to a renewed disturbance by this same small group of
                            women.</p>
                        <p>In her prepared speech, Ms. Sipila acknowledged the achievement and
                            contributions of the speakout while at the same time firmly explaining
                            that the conference management committee could not set a precedent by
                            granting floor time to a group not accredited to the Conference. She
                            urged the Tribune participants to press their national governments for
                            adoption of the World Plan of Action she predicted would emerge from the
                            World Conference. She enjoined her audience to carry their unification
                            beyond the Mexico City experience to create a network of women for
                            future implementation of the World Plan.</p>
                        <p>The publicized dissension on the part of a small group of women in no way
                            should be allowed to obscure the singular achievement of this large
                            group of women who - "put it all together" in such a business-like
                            manner, in the short space of a week and against innumerable odds. This
                            achievement stands as an example of unity of purpose and a triumph of
                            cooperation involving as it did women of such distinct and varying
                            backgrounds, talents, aspirations, and temperaments.</p>
                        <p>That a group of dedicated women working around the clock could overcome
                            substantial political and national differences to agree on a blueprint
                            for the improvement of the lives of women throughout the world is a
                            testimonial to the concept of self-help and to the vitality and
                            determination of these women to make their experience at the Tribune
                            significant for all women.</p>
                        <p>The last three days of the Tribune had been left unscheduled to be filled
                            by programs responding to the on-the-spot wishes of the delegates. A
                            variety of panels, seminars and ad hoc discussions, including a
                            standing-room only appearance of Congresswoman <persName
                                corresp="#p_ABS1">Bella Abzug</persName> speaking on "Women Power in
                            the Future" rounded out the Tribune sessions.</p>
                        <p>In retrospect it might be noted that the three official American
                            appearances at the Tribune, namely the Senator Percy panel, the American
                            delegation briefing, and Congresswoman Abzug's speech and press
                            conference were unmarked by any hostility or demonstrations. The
                            orchestrated dissension which featured so largely in the media coverage
                            of the Tribune was reserved for the speakout sessions and appeared to be
                            deliberately directed towards disrupting the efforts of those who were
                            succeeding in pulling the Tribune together in such a unified,
                            constructive, and inspiring fashion.</p>

                        <p>INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR 1975<lb/>July 24, 1975</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>As a public member of the U.S. Delegation to the World Conference of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss>, I enclose a report covering my
                            work and impressions during the historic meetings in Mexico City, June
                            19-July 2, 1975.</p>
                        <p>My principal assignment was as liaison between the U.S. Delegation to the
                            governmental World Conference and the American women attending the
                            non-governmental Tribune. The Tribune, open to any person who
                            registered, ran concurrently with the World Conference but was basically
                            separate from it by a near-hour's run through traffic.</p>
                        <p>At the Tribune there were 1,500 American women, and 4,500 women from more
                            than 80 foreign countries, and from a variety of economic and
                            educational backgrounds. Most of the women came with high hopes and
                            commitments to help other women; some brought special causes or
                            grievances in addition. The daily fare consisted of panels and lightly
                            structured discussions, usually constructive, sometimes rowdy, usually
                            freewheeling, sometimes manipulated, but always lively. A measure of
                            frustration set in when the women found that they were supposed to
                            discuss while the governmental conference, to which for the most part
                            they were denied access, was to make the decisions.</p>
                        <p>In reaching out to establish channels of communication with the Americans
                            at the Tribune we had to improvise and grasp opportunities as they came
                            along. Ours was the only Delegation to maintain a liaison contact with
                            the Tribune. The Delegation and Embassy arranged an early "get
                            acquainted" meeting between the Delegation and the Tribune participants
                            which began in stormy fashion but ended up as a net plus. There followed
                            on subsequent days panels and briefings by members of the Delegation,
                            including Congressional Advisers on the Delegation (Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_PC5">Percy</persName> and Representative <persName
                                corresp="#p_ABS1">Abzug</persName>); formally scheduled meetings
                            with non-governmental representatives; and informal meetings in the
                            corridors of the Tribune by members of the Delegation, including
                            Representatives <persName corresp="#p_HMM1">Heckler</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MPT1">Mink</persName>. Details of the various
                            appearances and "happenings" are given in my report.</p>
                        <p>Despite frustrations and some disappointments, and an often unfriendly
                            tone toward the United States in the discussions, the Tribune made
                            positive contributions on the status of women which I mention in the
                            report. The Tribune provided an enormous learning experience for
                            Americans and non-Americans from which an awareness emerged that the
                            problem of the status of women was universal, tho varying in priorities
                            and intensities. I also contributed to the work of world
                            consciousness-raising. One notable feature at the Tribune was the
                            emergence of two constructive groups--a large, "speak-out" group and a
                            smaller Latin American group-- each of which achieved accord on areas of
                            agreement among its members despite disruptive tactics from outside the
                            groups. I add the thought that world Tribunes and world Conferences as
                            they are now practiced and may be expected to recur in future, present
                            some very special problems for U.S. foreign policy, demanding detailed
                            and urgent study if adequate answers are to be found. I naturally make
                            some suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Delegation to the governmental Conference, under the direction
                            of <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Pat Hutar</persName> (for the long haul)
                            and Daniel Parker (briefly but significantly), with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ10">Jill Ruckelshaus</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ6">Jewel Lafontant</persName> as their two right
                            hands, did an exceptional job under more than usually difficult
                            circumstances, including a high incidence of illness within the
                            Delegation, inadequate facilities at the meeting sites, and formidable
                            transportation problems. Pat Hutar's sturdiness during the lively
                            "encounter" at the Chancery, with the telling support of all other
                            members of the Delegation, was a memorable part of the Mexico City
                            experience.</p>
                        <p>The cooperation from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JJJ1"
                                >Jova</persName> and the Embassy staff was superlative. So far as I
                            was aware, the Ambassador Jova never said "no" to any request, large or
                            small. Specially valuable also was the contribution made by the Embassy
                            Women's Association which maintained a Visitors' Center in the patio of
                            the Chancery throughout the period of the meetings and whose work was of
                            great help to the U.S. Center for IWY as well as to the Delegation.</p>
                        <p>My assignment would have been impossible without the generous and
                            talented help, usually spontaneously given as needs arose, from members
                            of the Delegation, including the Congressional Advisors on the
                            Delegation, and from many other persons who are named in Section VI of
                            the report.</p>
                        <p>My assignment was difficult, demanding educational--and I wouldn't have
                            missed it for anything. My thanks for the chance of participating in the
                            Mexico City meetings for they mark a true beginning of "world-wide
                            awareness of women's worth."</p>

                        <p>P.S. I realize that my report is on the long side. It covers developments
                            at the mechanism of the Tribune which should, in my view, be made a
                            matter of record. I hope that readers will at least scan the earlier
                            sections and look more carefully at the recommendations and suggestions

                        <p>REPORT BY RUTH BACON, PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION TO THE WORLD
                            CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR<lb/>MEXICO CITY, JUNE
                            19-JULY 2, 1975</p>
                        <p>There were in effect two worlds in operation concurrently in Mexico City.
                            There was the World Conference of the International Women's Year, open
                            to accredited representatives of governments, representatives of
                            accredited non-governmental organizations, and accredited
                            representatives of the press. There was the non-governmental Tribune,
                            open to virtually any person who registered.</p>
                        <p>My major assignment from Pat Hutar, co-chairperson of the U.S. Delegation
                            to the governmental Conference, was to serve as liaison between the U.S.
                            Delegation and the Americans attending the non-governmental Tribune, to
                            coordinate "happenings" so as maintain a two-way channel of
                            communication, and to make clear that the Delegation open and receptive
                            at all times to Americans attending the Tribune. </p>
                        <p>This was not the first Tribune in history. There had been a Tribune at
                            the Population Conference in Bucharest, and one in somewhat modified
                            form at the Environmental Conference in Stockholm. The Mexico City
                            Tribune made its own place in history.</p>
                        <p>I. THE TRIBUNE: WHO WAS THERE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE</p>
                        <p>The Tribune met at the Medical Center, a large, handsome building with
                            excellent facilities, including an auditorium seating 2,500 and several
                            smaller conference rooms. In the basement the Soviet Union and Cuba had
                            elaborate exhibits and a number of non-governmental organizations and
                            other groups had less ambitious displays. The atmosphere of the basement
                            was reminiscent of a subway station without the trains.</p>
                        <p>At the first statistical stocktaking the Tribune reported that 5,000
                            persons had registered, of whom 2,000 were Mexicans; 1,350 were
                            Americans; and the remainder came from more than 80 countries. The
                            proportion of women to men was about 10 to 1. The figures were later to
                            swell to a total attendance of 6,000.</p>
                        <p>These women came from many economic and educational levels. There were
                            women from non-governmental organizations; faculty and students from
                            colleges and high schools; women from the press; from businesses large
                            and small; homemakers; women from churches and other religious groups;
                            careerists; farmers. There were women from minority groups--Chicanas,
                            American Indians, Blacks, Puerto Ricans. There were women with special
                            causes--pro- or anti-abortion, anti-plutonium bombs, pro-world peace
                            day, pro-legalized prostitution, anti-multinational corporations, etc.
                            Absent, ironically, were women from the groups in Third World countries
                            most in need of help--the women at the endurance and subsistence level,
                            illiterate, ill, the mainstays of their families, old at 30. They were
                            often talked about but always through the voices of others.</p>
                        <p>It was the contact with diversity, followed by the realization that
                            beneath the diversity there was a large area of universally shared
                            concern among the women present, that was the initial and most lasting
                            impact of the Tribune on the American women with whom I talked. They
                            spoke of the experience of exchanging ideas, many times congenial but
                            sometimes shocking, with women from everywhere. One woman commented: "It
                            wasn't only in the Tribune meetings. I had such interesting
                            conversations with women in buses, in restaurants, in the hotel lobby,
                            everywhere. I had never really talked to Third World women before about
                            how they felt about things. Here I talked with women from Africa, Asia,
                            and Latin America, and learned that there are differences in language to
                            watch out for, such as, never to use the word 'abortion,' but to find
                            some other phrase. And a woman from Thailand told me that people in her
                            country liked Americans and the Thais that threw stones at our buildings
                            were only from small radical groups. How else could I ever have known
                            that?" These sentiments plus the discovery that the problem of women's
                            status is universal were echoed by American after American. </p>
                        <p>A second strong impression was soon to emerge. There women had come to
                            Mexico City, most of them full of high hopes of helping in at least some
                            small way to advance the status of women. They soon realized that there
                            was no formal role for them at the Tribune. They were to discuss but not
                            to resolve or decide. Decisions were for the governmental Conference on
                            the other side of Mexico City. They had been informed in advance of what
                            to expect in a booklet issued by the committee which organized the
                            Tribune. This committee was based in New York, headed by an American,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PM1">Mildred Persinger</persName>, of the
                            YWCA, and named "Committee of Non-Governmental Organizations in
                            Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United
                            Nations."</p>
                        <p>The committee's booklet state: "There shall by no formal statement of a
                            Tribune position on any or all of the issues. Individuals and groups may
                            make whatever statements they want, but not in the name of the Tribune."
                            Some had read this statement and acquiesced; others had not read it, or
                            had read it and rejected it. Most had assumed that they could at least
                            look in at the governmental Conference but they were soon to learn the
                            hard facts about protocol and space limitations. Few possessed the
                            necessary accreditation even to enter the Foreign Affairs Building where
                            the governmental Conference was meeting, and these few were likely to
                            find no space for visitors even to look in on the meeting s. The
                            governmental Conference was physically separated from the Tribune by
                            half a city and its famous traffic. As a practical matter the Conference
                            meetings were off limits to most persons attending the Tribune.</p>
                        <p>Other frustrations accumulated. Transportation was always difficult, at
                            times impossible. Services for reproducing documents at the Tribune were
                            always limited, at times non-existence. The Tribune's daily newspaper,
                            Xilonen (named for the Aztec goddess of the early corn and pronounced,
                            Shilonen) reported that the governmental Conference had chosen a man as
                            president and a man as chairperson of one of the two main committees of
                            the Conference; and that political issues were being permitted to
                            intrude into the Conference discussions. What were the government
                            Delegates thinking? Obviously they needed help.</p>
                        <p>II. AMERICAN APPEARANCES AND "HAPPENINGS" AT THE TRIBUNE</p>
                        <p>In planning the opening of channels between the Delegation and the
                            Tribune, we had in large part to feel our way, as moods surfaced and
                            subsided or changed direction with surprising speed. We had constantly
                            in mind the need to be open and helpful, and the need to avoid any
                            intimation of trying to control or direct. Our initial target groups
                            were: the women from non-governmental organizations; minority groups;
                            labor union women; and friendly foreign groups with constructive ideas.
                            We wanted a quick, let's-get-acquainted session; some substantial
                            "happenings" to establish a two-way relationship of understanding; and
                            then a final event that would leave a warm feeling. Although there were
                            rough spots along the way, this general outline actually did take
                            shape.</p>
                        <p>The principal appearances and "happenings" were:</p>
                        <p>A. Delegation's Open House at the Embassy Chancery, June 21</p>
                        <p>This event was intended to provide a quick get-acquainted session with
                            members of the Delegation for Americas, chiefly those from
                            non-governmental organizations, at the Tribune. Some 200-300 attended in
                            an informal setting in the patio area of the first floor of the
                            Chancery. At the outset, a radical-type confrontation was staged by a
                            small group of women, U.S. and foreigners and mostly from the Congress
                            of Racial Equality (<gloss target="#t_CORE1">CORE</gloss>), directed by
                            a man. By chanting, shouting and grabbing the microphone they tried to
                            prevent Daniel Parker and Pat Hutar and then, after his brief speech and
                            departures for the airport, thru patience and stamina on the part of Pat
                            Hutar, and with telling support from each member of the Delegation
                            speaking in turn, the storm was ridden out and the atmosphere at the
                            meeting largely turned around.</p>
                        <p>The meeting lasted three hours during which many persons had a chance to
                            voice views. Complaints covered: the election of a man as President of
                            the governmental Conference; the composition of the U.S. Delegation,
                            allegedly not adequately representative of minority groups and with a
                            man as co-chairperson; the composition of Third World Delegations (too
                            elitist); the intrusion of political issues at the governmental
                            Conference at the expense of women's interests etc. One American woman
                            lawyer suggested that it would be better to make constructive
                            suggestions instead of merely voicing complaints about matters outside
                            the control of the Delegation, and she gave as one suggestion the
                            working out of revisions to the draft Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>The exchange, while difficult, was beneficial in total effect. It
                            demonstrated the Delegation's willingness to meet and discuss issues
                            with all comers. It gave groups which felt grievances a chance to
                            express their feelings. It alerted many of the Americans present to some
                            of the views and tactics they would later meet at the Tribune. As each
                            Delegation member spoke in turn, it became abundantly clear that
                            minorities were in fact adequately represented and also that each member
                            of the Delegation felt a deep personal commitment to the progress of
                            women. From these brief reports members of the Delegation also learned a
                            great deal about each other of which they had previously been unaware.
                            The encounter also created a feeling of personal acquaintanceship
                            between members of the Delegation and much of the audience not
                            participating in the demonstration which difficult to achieve
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Pat Hutar described the exchange as an example of democracy in action.
                            Referring to the women participants, she said: "We need their input and
                            there is no tine for a leisurely debate."</p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for the meeting, including the difficult task of getting
                            out invitations before the Tribune had any list of registrants or
                            addresses, were largely the work of <persName corresp="#p_AVR1">Virginia
                                Allan</persName>, Mildred Marty and Embassy officers.)</p>
                        <p>B. Embassy Residence Reception, Sunday, June 22</p>
                        <p>Ambassador and Mrs. Jove gave a reception at the Residence for
                            representatives from non-governmental organizations, members of the U.S.
                            and foreign Delegations, Embassy officials and many others. Beautifully
                            arranged, this occasion provided the opportunity for exchanging views
                            and getting acquainted at the outset of the meetings.</p>
                        <p>C. Panel Chaired by Senator Percy on Foreign Aid and Women, June 24</p>
                        <p>This panel, held before a standing room only audience and chaired by
                            Senator Percy, a congressional advisor on the Delegation, was a great
                            success. Senator Percy arrived early and shook hands in advance with
                            most of the audience. On the panel with him were women from Ghana,
                            Kenya, Korea and Trinidad-Tobago. Each of the Third-World women
                            explained how foreign aid could be made more effective in her country,
                            and the Senator discussed American <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            programs in the light of the Percy amendment. During the question
                            period, the Senator deftly shared questions with his colleagues on the
                            panel. The impact of the panel as a whole and of Senator Percy
                            personally was highly favorable. </p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for this panel were worked out chiefly by members of
                            Senator Percy's staff who arrived early in Mexico City: Julia Bloch,
                            Marilyn Harris and Fianna McCornack.)</p>

                            25, 27, and 30</p>
                        <p>These meetings held in a Chancery conference room in the early morning
                            (7:15 AM) brought together members of the U.S. Delegation and presidents
                            of national non-governmental organizations having country-wide networks
                            in the U.S. Thru this channel, leaders were informed of developments at
                            the Conference and their views in turn obtained on developments at the
                            Conference and at the Tribune. Their future cooperation was also sought
                            in dealing with the problem of implementing the World Plan of Action.
                            The meetings met a very real, need on the part of both the
                            non-governmental organizations and the Delegation and may prove to have
                            been effective in forging a continuing link for the future.</p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for the meetings were largely worked out by Virginia Allan
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MMK1">Mildred Marcy</persName>, with help from
                            the Embassy and from Delegation members.)</p>

                            27</p>
                        <p>The Tribune asked certain key delegations in turn to provide a morning
                            briefing at the Tribune on the matters they considered most important at
                            the governmental Conference. The U.S. turn came on June 27, and the
                            Delegation was represented by Pat Hutar, Jewel Lafontant, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GJ3">Joan Goodin</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA7">Arvonne Fraser</persName>. Each spoke briefly on
                            different aspects of the U.S. position at the Conference and then
                            answered questions. All were able to relate warmly to the audience which
                            responded in friendly fashion. Jill Ruckelshaus remained after the
                            briefing to meet women informally and exchange views. </p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for the meeting were largely in the hands of Kay Ray and
                            Dorothy Robbins-Mowry, with help from many members of the
                            Delegation.)</p>
                        <p>F. Ceremony Marking the U.S. IWY Stamp, June 27</p>
                        <p>After several delays, a brief ceremony to mark the unveiling of the U.S.
                            postage stamp honoring International Women's Year was held at the
                            Chancery on the morning of June 27. The ceremony was attended by
                            Ambassador Jova, Pat Hutar and several other Delegation members, and by
                            members of the U.S. Center for IWY including Yvonne Lewis, who had
                            worked with the U.S. postal authorities on the stamp over the past
                            months. Invited guests were Americans from non-governmental
                            organizations at the Tribune.</p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for the meting were shared by Virginia Allan, Yvonne Lewis,
                            Kay Ray, and Embassy officers.)</p>
                        <p>G. Other Contacts with the Tribune</p>
                        <p>Individual members of the Delegation made a point of establishing
                            contacts with individuals and groupings at the Tribune. Jewel Lafontant,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGB1">Gilda Gjurich</persName>, <persName

                            Joan Goodin all gave exceptional service in working with minority,
                            labor, and other groupings. All members of the Delegation, including
                            Congressional Advisors <persName corresp="#p_HMM1">Heckler</persName>
                            and Nink, on a time available basis, came to the Tribune and talked
                            informally in the corridors with any women who wished to exchange
                            views.</p>
                        <p>H. Visitors Center of the Embassy Women's Association</p>
                        <p>Throughout the period of the Tribune and Conference, the Embassy Women's
                            Association maintained a visitors' center in the patio of the Chancery
                            where visitors in Mexico City for the Tribune or the Conference could
                            stop by for information, a chance to visit with Embassy women and
                            Delegation members, a cup of coffee, some IWY jewelry, a place to talk.
                            It was an original and appreciated program which supplemented the
                            Delegation's efforts to make American women feel welcome. The U.S.
                            Center for IWY had reason to feel especially grateful also to the
                            Embassy Women's Association for their work.</p>

                            Tribune, Tuesday, July 1</p>
                        <p>Bella Abzug, a Congressional Adviser on the U.S. Delegation, spoke to a
                            large and cheering audience at a meeting sponsored and chaired by the
                            National Women's Political Caucus. The Tribune's newspaper, Xilonen,
                            reported: "Abzug kept an enthusiastic audience laughing and clapping
                            through much of her address to the Tribune on women's role in politics
                            and the power structure." She received a standing ovation before and
                            after the talk. She later held a press conference at the Tribune. Her
                            talk provided an enthusiastic and warm conclusion to American
                            "happenings" at the Tribune.</p>
                        <p>(Arrangements for the meeting were worked out by members of the

                        <p>II. DEVELOPMENTS AT THE TRIBUNE</p>
                        <p>A. The Panels and Briefings</p>
                        <p>The organizing committee for the Tribune under <persName corresp="#p_PM1"
                                >Mildred Persinger</persName>, an American, consisted of nearly a
                            dozen persons, many of them American, but with foreign representation as
                            well, assisted by an international staff.</p>
                        <p>The Tribune's daily schedule called for early morning briefings
                            developments at the governmental Conference, followed by panels on a
                            variety of topics of general concern ("Building the Human Community",
                            "Women Across Cultures", "Law and the Status of Women", "Agriculture and
                            Rural Development", "Health and Nutrition.") The panels were followed by
                            question periods. There were also spontaneously arranged group meetings.
                            The last three days were left entirely unstructured and available for
                            later programming. The panels understandably were uneven in quality,
                            some highly constructive, others superficial.</p>
                        <p>The panels included some Americans such as <persName corresp="#p_FB3"
                                >Betty Friedan</persName> of the National Women's Political Caucus;
                            Ruth Clusen of the League of Women Voters and a member of the U.S.
                            Delegation; Luke Lee from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy;
                            Madonna Gilbert of the Rapid City American Indian Movement; Florence
                            Jackson of the Bureau of Social Studies, New York Board of Education;
                            Mary Ann Krupsak, Lieutenant Governor of New York. Nira Long of AID was
                            to have been on a panels but when assignments at the governmental
                            Conference conflicted, her place was very ably taken by Nan Frederick of
                            AID.</p>
                        <p>Among women who were given a notably enthusiastic reception at the
                            Tribune were Mrs. Echeverria, wife of the President of Mexico, who spoke
                            at the inaugural session of the Tribune; Hortensia Allende, who was
                            received tumultuously and showered with flowers; the Soviet astronaut
                            who gave a low key presentation, stressing the future Communist World
                            Congress scheduled for next October in Berlin; Elizabeth Reid of
                            Australia, a forthright critic of many issues popular with the Third
                            World, who nonetheless was highly popular; and Helvi <persName
                                corresp="#p_SH4">Sipila</persName>, one of the UN's Assistant
                            Secretary Generals and coordinator of the governmental Conference. Betty
                            Friedan of the United States, while an object of criticism as well as
                            praise, was an outstanding figure at the Tribune.</p>
                        <p>Many Americans with whom I talked were disturbed by the anti-American
                            tone of many of the discussions at the Tribune. The United States was
                            blamed for most of the world's ills. It was accused of imperialism; of
                            forceful sterilization of Puerto Ricans; of oppressing minorities; of
                            pushing drugs and prostitution in Vietnam; of using aid to advance
                            American interests and downgrade the status of women; etc. Comparatively
                            little argument was put up on the other side. In many cases the
                            Americans present did not know the facts. In some cases they hesitated
                            to speak up for fear of bragging; in other cases in the smaller group
                            sessions Americans were openly discouraged from trying to use the
                            microphone.</p>
                        <p>There were, of course, bright moments as well. When Bella Abzug for
                            example, in response to a questioner, agreed that the United States had
                            made many mistakes in foreign policy and then added, in effect, "but you
                            must remember every other country on earth has made mistakes and more of
                            them, " she received a warm round of applause from a predominantly
                            American audience.</p>
                        <p>B. The "Speak-Out", Latin American, and Labor Union Groups</p>
                        <p>Although the Tribune sessions had been designed for discussion, not
                            decision, several groupings emerged than effort to make a constructive
                            input.</p>
                        <p>The largest were the so-called "speak-out" sessions, organized by women
                            from the United States and several foreign countries. Leadership came
                            from Betty Friedan and from women from Australia, Canada, India, Japan,
                            Korea, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Others were added as the
                            sessions progressed. The draft Plan of Action which was before the
                            governmental Conference for discussion was taken as a point of
                            departure, and specific revisions were developed.</p>
                        <p>The proposed revisions were of a practical, constructive nature,
                            reflecting in part the view that the draft Plan distributed by the UN
                            Secretariat treated women too much as an economic unit without adequate
                            regard to hearing other needs and aspirations. It also placed great
                            emphasis on the need for adequate implementation. Many of the
                            suggestions were in fact in line with the positions of many Delegations.
                            One significant new proposal was the establishment by the UN of a post
                            of Under Secretary General for Women's Concerns, who would be assisted
                            by an ad hoc committee of consultants and adequately staffed and
                            funded.</p>
                        <p>The proposed revisions were accepted with enthusiasm at an extraordinary
                            session of some 2,000 at the Tribune. As the revisions took the form of
                            item and line references to the draft Plan of Action and as copies of
                            the proposed revisions were in short supply it is probable that the
                            audience was endorsing positive and constructive action rather than the
                            substance of the specific revisions. It was decided also to send a
                            committee with the document to Helvi Sipila, Coordinator of the
                            government Conference, with a request that the views might be presented
                            to the Conference.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime a group speaking for Latin American women numbering some
                            900 members had also emerged and was at work on a declaration of views
                            in an effort to create a Latin American feminist consciousness. I talked
                            with the leader of the Latin American group who said that her group had
                            attempted to work with the "speak-out" group by had in fact been
                            rebuffed by it. However that may be, the Latin American group was in
                            turn subjected to pressures from various sources for not being
                            sufficiently politically oriented, in particular for their failure to
                            condemn imperialism, colonialism, etc. The Latin American declaration
                            was presented to Assistant Secretary General Sipila along with the
                            proposed revisions of the draft Plan prepared by the "speak-out" group.
                            Mrs. Sipila received the group cordially, agreed to consider the request
                            of the committee to present its views to the Conference, and said she
                            would come in person to the Tribune on the following day to give the
                            answer.</p>
                        <p>When Mrs. Sipila appeared at the Tribune, she entered a room of 2,000
                            persons which was in disorder as a result of disruptive efforts by a
                            small group who evidently was opposed to constructive efforts within the
                            Tribune. In a dramatic incident Mrs. Sipila addressed the audience, gave
                            them an answer they did not wish to hear--that the governmental
                            Conference could not receive the committee--and received a standing
                            ovation. The incident was in part a tribute to the respect in which Mrs.
                            Sipila was held and to her ability to move an audience. As soon as Mrs.
                            Sipila departed, the meeting dissolved into disorder again.</p>
                        <p>The American Embassy was later, in a remarkable effort, to provide copies
                            of the "speak-out's" proposed revisions and the Latin American group's
                            declaration for all participants at the Tribune.</p>
                        <p>On June 30, when a panel from the main geographic regions was to present
                            views to the press on the revisions of the draft Plan of Action proposed
                            by the "speak-out" group, the meeting was broken up by hecklers who
                            chanted and shouted and grabbed the microphones in a manner which one
                            American equated with Nazi storm trooper methods. Despite pleas for
                            unity and order, the disruption continued. I was told by a Latin
                            American that the disrupters were "exiles" from Latin American countries
                            and Puerto Rico living in Mexico City and it was widely rumored that the
                            disruption had Mexican support.</p>
                        <p>Despite the disruptive incidents the "speak-out" and Latin American
                            groups represented a significant constructive effort. One American
                            commented of the "speak-out" group, "We have done something the world
                            has never seen before--we have come together as a grassroots movement as
                            women."</p>
                        <p>U.S. and other labor union women also met together and prepared a "call
                            for action" directed toward removing discriminations against women in
                            their economic, political, and social lives.</p>
                        <p>C. Other Meetings in Connection with the Tribune</p>
                        <p>Several groups arranged to hold meetings in advance of the Tribune or
                            after its completion. Among these meetings were:</p>
                        <p>1. Women in Development seminar (June 14-18), sponsored by the American
                            Association for the Advancement of Science, brought together a small
                            group of regional experts and a large froup of country experts to
                            examine certain issue areas.</p>
                        <p>2. The Journalism Encounter (June 16-18), organized by the Center for
                            Economic and Social Information of the United Nations Office of Public
                            Information, was open to all media accredited to the World Conference
                            and also to some 50 specifically invited Fellows selected from
                            developing countries.</p>
                        <p>3. Media Workshop (July 3-4), sponsored by <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1"
                                >UNESCO</gloss>, brought together professionals, including selected
                            United Nations Fellows, to discuss the implementation of the conclusions
                            of the World Conference.</p>
                        <p>4. International Seminar (June 18-July 14), sponsored by the National
                            Council of Negro Women, held meetings first in Mexico City, and after
                            the conclusion of the Tribune it met in four cities of Mississippi and
                            at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida. The seminar
                            brought together 25 delegates from developing countries in Africa, the
                            Caribbean and Latin America, and U.S. counterparts. The focus was on
                            rural community development in developing and developed countries.</p>
                        <p>IV. IMPACT OF THE TRIBUNE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN</p>
                        <p>Despite its frustrations and some disappointments, the Tribune made a
                            positive contribution to the progress of the status of women in many
                            directions.</p>
                        <p>1. It provided a valuable educational experience for American women and
                            for non-Americans alike. Many had never had a chance to discuss their
                            basic concerns on a personal footing across national barriers on any
                            scale even remotely approaching the Tribune. </p>
                        <p>2. Many women discovered at the Tribune a vast area of shared concerns on
                            the part of women, world-wide. The problem of the status of women
                            emerged as universal, tho varying in priorities sad intensities.</p>
                        <p>3. Unlike the Delegates at the governmental Conference, the Americans at
                            the Tribune represented in substantial degree the grassroots, and the
                            Impact of their experience would be widely diffused nationally.</p>
                        <p>4. Regularly scheduled meetings between American women at the Tribune
                            representing non-governmental organizations and members of the
                            Delegation served to widen the area of mutual understanding between the
                            Delegation and these organizations, with the results which should carry
                            over into the future.</p>
                        <p>5. While it had been planned that the Tribune would discuss but not
                            resolve, two groupings were able, despite disruptive tactics practiced
                            against them, to achieve documents of importance. The "speak-out"
                            grouping proposed revisions of the draft Plan of Action which were
                            approved by a meeting of 2,000. The Latin American grouping, numbering
                            some 900, prepared a declaration of principles for Latin American women.
                            Many of the ideas in these documents found their way informally into the
                            work of the Conference thru the speeches or positions of national
                            Delegations. </p>
                        <p>6. American women say, some for the first time, how mechanisms such as
                            the Tribune and the governmental Conference operate, and the need to
                            know basic facts such as how to get on panels, how to learn what is
                            going on, how to obtain access to a microphone. They needed also to
                            learn how governmental conferences choose officials, how and when
                            resolutions may be introduced into such conferences, how amendments are
                            handled, etc. They saw also how small minorities could dominate large
                            groups and how political and economic issues like anti-Zionism or the
                            new economic order or anti-imperialism could be used to divert and
                            divide. They were shown the uses of preparation, cooperation, and
                            fore-knowledge, and in consequence should be better prepared at future
                            international meetings.</p>
                        <p>7. American women also were made aware of the need to follow up on the
                            good intentions expressed at the governmental Conference. As the Tribune
                            ended, American women in groups and individually were asking: "What can
                            we do to help implement the Plan of Action?" The answer to this question
                            offers a means for insuring that the Mexico City experience continues as
                            a moving force for the improvement of the status of women.</p>
                        <p>IMPLICATIONS OF THE TRIBUNE FOR U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</p>
                        <p>Developments at the Tribune were to some extent helpful in terms of U.S.
                            foreign policy, to a larger extent unhelpful, and in total they raised
                            the question of how the U.S. Government should approach future tribunes.
                            My guess is that we should accept the probability that world tribunes
                            will recur and should plan accordingly. I do not know to what extent the
                            IWY Tribune was a special case because of the impact of women's issues,
                            the proximity of the meeting site to the United States, and the fact
                            that they host country regards itself as the sponsor of the new economic
                            order. However that may be, there is need for a prompt study in depth of
                            what happened at the IWY Tribune, why it happened, and how the United
                            States might plan in connection with future tribunes.</p>
                        <p>A. Helpful Aspects</p>
                        <p>1. U.S. initiatives, or support for initiatives, in areas of real concern
                            to women were known to many at the Tribune thru appearances by members
                            of the U.S. Delegation on briefing or discussion panels and thru reports
                            from the governmental Conference. There could be little doubt on the
                            part of open-minded persons of the sincerity of the U.S. commitment
                            toward improving the status of women. On the other hand, the U.S.
                            attitude toward the new economic order and against the intrusion of
                            political issues such as apartheid, Zionism, etc., appeared to be
                            understood and approved by some, misunderstood by others, and
                            deliberately misinterpreted by still others.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. Delegation and Embassy were credited with being the only ones
                            that genuinely tried to work with the Tribune, to provide information
                            and documents, to listen to suggestions, and bring them in one way or
                            another to the attention of the governmental Conference. Comments to
                            this effect were made by individuals and by the local press in Mexico
                            City, and were echoed at the Delegation's debriefing on its return by a
                            British Indian in the audience.</p>
                        <p>3. The volume and tone of some of the invective against the United States
                            may have caused some hitherto unconcerned Americans to become more alert
                            to the problems with which this country must cope. One newspaper
                            reporter told me, "I was trained in the liberal school of journalism and
                            I never gave much thought to patriotism. After my experience here I am
                            going home and do a lot of hard thinking." The less aware, however, of
                            course, may have been taken in by the charges.</p>
                        <p>B. Unhelpful Aspects</p>
                        <p>1. There were elements at the Tribune intent on creating disunity and
                            insuring that no consensus should be permitted to develop which did not
                            condemn imperialism, Zionism, apartheid, etc., and which did not support
                            the new economic order. It is significant to note that the disruptions
                            at the Tribune were directed against the "speak-out" and Latin American
                            groupings as they separately reached for a consensus, and that neither
                            of these groupings was willing to follow the party line. Eastern
                            Europeans were intent also on playing down the Tribune and Conference
                            and playing up the forthcoming Communist World Congress of International
                            Women's Year which is scheduled for East Berlin in October. The themes
                            of "play up the new economic order", "play up the Communist World
                            Congress", "play down the Mexico City Tribune and Conference",
                            "disparage the U.S.", were mutually helpful to the East Europeans and to
                            the proponents of the new economic order, and this attracted adherents
                            from various political quarters. By contrast with these clearly
                            organized pressure groups, in which small but noisy contingents of
                            Americans sometimes participated, the great majority of Americans were
                            unorganized. While deploring, albeit largely silently, the political
                            intrusions, they wanted to concentrate on constructive discussion of
                            issues of major concern to women.</p>
                        <p>2. Many Americans were concerned, some were shocked, by the disruptive
                            tactics of small groups and by the biased criticism of the United States
                            at the Tribune. In some cases foreign nationals offered effective verbal
                            resistance to the would-be disrupters. In some cases foreigners and
                            Americans responded to the more biased criticism of the United States.
                            It would be simplistic, however, to assume that the disruptions and the
                            constant disparagement of the United States thru allegations clearly
                            targeted at the Third World, had not had its effect.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to overplay the prominence of the disruptive tactics
                            because they actually occurred on only a few occasions. The criticism
                            was almost constant. In inquiring within my own mind why more effective
                            tactics were not employed when the disrupters numbered only 30 or 40 out
                            of an audience of 2,000, I came up with a number of reasons. So far as
                            Americans are concerned, most of the women from non-governmental
                            organizations are not used to strong-arm tactics and recoil from the
                            type of physical conflict which standing up to them would in some cases
                            have involved. So far as criticism of the United States is concerned,
                            many women hesitate to brag. Many were unsure of the details of our
                            negotiations with the Micronesians or over the Panama Canal Zone or
                            other such topics. In some cases getting access to a microphone would
                            have been practically impossible.</p>
                        <p>The net result, however, was that the, strong and constructive aspects of
                            American foreign policy were not adequately put forward while the views
                            of hostile critics were. This situation cannot be of serious concern
                            from the point of view of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The solution is not an easy one, in part because of the very commendably
                            independent nature of the average American attending a tribune or world
                            conference. Many of those present in Mexico City were, however,
                            concerned and as they return home and communicate their concern to
                            others, there may be a greater understanding of the problem. In this
                            belief I give below certain suggestions.</p>
                        <p>1. The first and most urgent need is for thorough-going study of the
                            tribune as a mechanism, its problems, its opportunities, and possible
                            future steps.</p>
                        <p>2. If disruptive tactics are to be minimized, and if a more balanced
                            image of the United States is to be presented at future tribunes, major
                            reliance will have to be placed on the understanding and cooperation of
                            non-governmental organizations. What is essential on their part is an
                            awareness of the problem, the need for advance preparation for learning
                            the rules, and for cooperative arrangements in advance of future
                            tribunes or world conferences.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Center for IWY and the National Commission for the Observance of
                            IWY can call attention to this problem as occasion offers. The main
                            impetus, however, has got to come from the organizations themselves.
                            Perhaps the grouping with which Virginia Allan worked at Mexico City
                            might be helpful. During future conferences or tribunes, our delegation
                            and our Embassy should stand ready to be helpful while avoiding any
                            impression of directing or controlling American non-governmental
                            participants.</p>
                        <p>3. Private Americans, long conditioned to self-criticism and to accepting
                            criticism from others, need an example if they are to discard the "turn
                            the other cheek" approach. The U.S. Government should provide this
                            example by discarding humility and calling attention to our achievements
                            and to our strong points, among which predominantly is our belief in
                            human freedom. Here is something for which is unattainable in many
                            countries, yet so far as I am aware, we seldom mention it at
                            international conferences. Or, again, why not mention our MIAs?</p>
                        <p>4. Private Americans also need hard facts. In Mexico City, for example,
                            when Pat Hutar made a brief but effective response on the Panama Canal
                            issue, her statement gave private Americans in the corridors at the
                            Conference and the Tribune basic facts on which they could rely with
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>5. Attractive pamphlets giving in brief and unbureaucratic language some
                            outstanding American achievements in the area of concern to the tribune
                            or conference should be prepared and distributed widely. The Department
                            of Labor, for example, has an excellent pamphlet on federal laws
                            affecting women. 5,000 copies of this at the Mexico City Tribune would
                            have met a real need.</p>
                        <p>6. At the Mexico City Tribune both the Soviet Union and Cuba had
                            impressive national exhibits in the form of pictures, posters, etc. The
                            United States should decide whether to mount an exhibit at a future
                            tribune. If it does, the exhibit should be of top quality.</p>
                        <p>7. Appearances by popular and well-known Americans who are knowledgeable
                            about topics under discussion and can draw and hold large and
                            potentially difficult audiences are essential.</p>
                        <p>8. Finally, there is the question of the structure of the tribune. If the
                            UN so desired, means could certainly be found for some input from the
                            tribune into the conference. If my memory holds there is a precedent of
                            sorts when, in 1918, the Pan American Union, at its Havana conference
                            handled a request to be heard by a group of women by arranging for an
                            unofficial meeting. This meeting ultimately led, as I recall, to the
                            creation of the Inter-American Commission of Women.</p>
                        <p>There is the question, however: Is it desirable to have groups at the
                            tribune have access in some direct form to the conference other than
                            thru national delegations, or representatives of accredited
                            organizations?</p>
                        <p>Any kind of an informed consensus among the 6,000 persons in the Tribune
                            at Mexico City would have been unachievable. With the conditions
                            existing there, the Tribune was subject to emotional appeals, on
                            occasion to strong-arm disruptions by orchestrated groups, and its mood
                            swung rapidly from one to another. Positions could emerge ostensibly in
                            the name of a group which in fact represented the views of only a few
                            determined persons. As the problem may well recur in the future, here is
                            a situation which should be analyzed.</p>
                        <p>9. One more final thought--this time about the appointment of the U.S.
                            Delegation. From time immemorial it has been the tradition to appoint
                            U.S. delegations to international conferences at the last moment so that
                            they might arrive, breathless and with open minds, to begin their work
                            at the conference. This tradition was honored in full with the U.S.
                            Delegation to the IWY World Conference. Generations of Americans before
                            me have expressed the hope that the human mind might in time and with
                            the advantages of modern technology prove capable of devising some more
                            rational system. I fervently echo this hope. At a UN Conference under
                            conditions existing in 1975, other delegations provide an American
                            delegation with more than ample opportunities to prove its [omission is
                            in the original]. The delegation does not need to be given additional
                            handicaps by its own government.</p>

                        <p>1. SUMMARY: EARLY IN THE SESSION THE US INDENTIFIED 3 PRINCIPAL AREAS FOR
                            FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES TO THE WORLD CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S
                            YEAR(WCIWY), THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING NEGOTIATION OF AN ACCEPTABLE
                            OMNIBUS RESOLUTION TO SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR CARRYING FORWARD THE WORLD
                            PLAN OF ACTION. THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTED 11 RESOLUTIONS AND DRAFT
                            DECISIONS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF
                            THE STATUS OF WOMEN. THE US SUPPORTED 8, OPPOSED 2 SOVIET-INITIATED
                            DRAFTS AND ABSTAINED ON THE KEY OMNIBUS RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF WORDING IN
                            TWO OPERATIVE PARAGRAPHS. IN VIEW OF THE HEIGHTENED POLITICIZATION OF
                            THE THIRD COMMITTEE (ESPECIALLY THE ZIONISM ISSUE), SUCH AN OUTCOME WAS
                            REALISTICALLY THE BEST THAT COULD BE EXPECTED. THE CRITICAL VOTE ON THE
                            OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH OF THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION REFERRING TO THE
                            DECLARATION OF MEXICO AND THUS RAISING THE ZIONISM ISSUE, LINED UP 50
                            COUNTRIES WHICH DID NOT ENDORSE THE "ACTION PROPOSALS" IN THE MEXICO
                            CITY DOCUMENTS. IN SUBSTANCE, THE RESOLUTIONS PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY
                            BASIS FOR FOLLOW-UP TO WCIWY THROUGH A DECADE FOR WOMEN, THE MAJOR
                            FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE OUTCOME WERE THE STRONG STAND TAKEN BY THE
                            U.S. DURING NEGOTIATIONS, COORDINATION WITH THE <gloss target="#t_EC91"
                                >EC-9</gloss>, THE GENUINE EFFORTS OF THE PRIMARY CO-SPONSORS TO
                            PRODUCE A COMPROMISE TEXT AND THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS ADVANCED THEIR
                            IDEOLOGICAL CONCERNS THROUGH SEPARATE RESOLUTIONS RATHER THAN BY
                            AMENDING THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION. END SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>2. EARLY IN THE SESSION, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> REVIEWED
                            THE PROSPECTS FOR FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES TO THE WOMEN'S CONFERENCE ON
                            INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR (WCIWY). IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT,
                            THREE AREAS FOR ACTION WERE IDENTIFIED (<gloss target="#t_REFTEL1"
                                >REFTEL</gloss>): NEGOTIATION OF AN ACCEPTABLE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION TO
                            SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR CARRYING FORWARD THE WORLD PLAN OF ACTION AND
                            OTHER U.S. INITIATIVES TAKEN AT MEXICO CITY; MEASURES TO PROMOTE THE
                            FULL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS; MEASURES TO
                            INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN THE <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            SECRETARIAT. </p>
                        <p>3. THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTED 11 RESOLUTIONS AND DRAFT DECISIONS
                            RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE STATUS
                            OF WOMEN. THE DRAFT DECISION FURTHERING THE WORK OF THE JOINT ADVISORY
                            COMMITTEE'S STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN THE
                            SECRETARIAT WAS DEFERRED FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION. THE U.S. SUPPORTED 8
                            OF THESE MEASURES, VOTED AGAINST 2 SOVIET-INITIATED DRAFTS AND ABSTAINED
                            ON THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION--THE CENTERPIECE OF FOLLOW-UP ACTION. THE U.S.
                            WAS JOINED BY THE EC-9 IN ALL BUT ONE THESE VOTES.</p>
                        <p>4. IN VIEW OF THE INJECTION OF THE ZIONISM ISSUE AT MEXICO CITY AND THE
                            HEIGHTENED POLITICIZATION OF THE THIRD COMMITTEE WHERE THE BULK OF
                            WOMEN'S ITEMS WERE CONCENTRATED, SUCH AN OUTCOME WAS REALISTICALLY THE
                            BEST THAT COULD BE EXPECTED. UNLIKE EARLIER TACTICS ON THE WOMEN'S
                            ISSUE, THE SOVIET BLOC THIS TIME DID NOT DIRECTLY OPPOSE <gloss
                                target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss> ACTIVITIES. INSTEAD, THE THREAT WAS
                            THAT SOME DELEGATIONS WOULD USE THE WOMEN'S ITEMS TO PROMOTE EXTRANEOUS
                            POLITICAL CAUSES AND THIS ALIENATE WESTERN SUPPORT. THE DESIRE OF SOME
                            TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE URGING IMPLEMENTATION OF <gloss target="#t_CERDS1"
                                >CERDS</gloss> OR ZNTI-ZIONISM MEASURES AND THE DEMONSTRATED
                            CAPACITY OF THE THIRD COMMITTEE TO DISTORT BROADLY-BASED PROGRAMS SUCH
                            AS THE DECADE AGAINST RACISM CREATED A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE FINAL
                            OMNIBUS RESOLUTION MIGHT BE MADE UNACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. SUCH DID NOT
                            PROVE TO BE THE CASE. BOTH THE FIRM STAND TAKEN BY THE U.S. (AND TO A
                            LESSER DEGREE BY THE EC-9, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND) DURING
                            NEGOTIATIONS AND THE GENUINE EFFORTS OF THE PRINCIPAL CO-SPONSORS TO
                            PREVENT INTRODUCTION OF MORE OBJECTIONABLE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS
                            RESULTED IN A MODERATE RESOLUTION. THE U.S. AND THE EC-9 ABSTAINED ON
                            THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF WORDING IN TWO OPERATIVE PARAGRAPHS, BUT
                            INDICATED THEIR INTENTION TO CARRY OUT THE PLAN OF ACTION AND
                            PARTICIPATE IN THE DECADE. </p>
                        <p>5. IN THE CRITICAL VOTE ON THE OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH OF THE OMNIBUS
                            RESOLUTION THAT REFERRED TO THE MEXICO DECLARATION AND THUS RAISED MOST
                            DIRECTLY THE ZIONISM ISSUE, 50 COUNTRIES DID NOT ENDORSE THE A "ACTION
                            PROPOSALS" CONTAINED IN THE MEXICO CITY DOCUMENTS. THIS VOTE ON
                            OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 1 OF 83-24 (U.S.)-26 COMPARES REASONABLY WELL WITH
                            THE PLENARY VOTE NOVEMBER 10 ON THE ANTI-ZIONISM RESOLUTION OF
                            72-35(U.S.)-32. MANY DELEGATIONS CONSIDERED THAT THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION
                            DEALT ONLY TANGENTIALLY WITH THE ISSUE OF ZIONISM, UNLIKE THE RESOLUTION
                            ON RACISM WHICH DEALT WITH IT DIRECTLY. THE U.S. HOWEVER OPPOSED THIS
                            PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT OBJECTED TO ANY WORDING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED
                            AS GIVING BLANKET ENDORSEMENT TO THE DECLARATION OR TO ALL RESOLUTIONS
                            ADOPTED AT MEXICO CITY, AND MADE CLEAR THAT IT DID NOT CONSIDER THE
                            DECLARATION TO CONTAIN "ACTION PROPOSALS".</p>
                        <p>6. EXCLUDING THE 2 SOVIET DRAFTS, THE 8 RESOLUTIONS AND DRAFT DECISION
                            ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY PROVIDE A BASIS FOR FOLLOW-UP TO THE
                            WORLD CONFERENCE ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR AND MAP OUT MORE
                            SPECIFIC, CONCRETE ACTIVITIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE UN SYSTEM, MEMBER
                            STATES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE SOVIET DRAFTS ARE LARGELY
                            AN ATTEMPT TO PLACE ON RECORD UN ENDORSEMENT OF THE CURRENT SOVIET LINE
                            WHICH LINKS IMPROVEMENT OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS WITH STRENGTHENING
                            INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUCH FORCES AS RACISM AND
                            COLONIALISM. IN CONTRAST, THE OTHER RESOLUTIONS SPUR ACTION ON THREE
                            FRONTS. THE GENERALLY WORKMAN LIKE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION IS THE CENTERPIECE
                            OF FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES AND DESIGNED TO CARRY FORWARD THE INITIATIVES
                            TAKEN AT MEXICO CITY, PARTICULARLY THE PLAN OF ACTION. IT ESTABLISHES A

                            DIRECTED AGAINST ZIONISM. A DRAFT DECISION WAS ALSO ADOPTED WHICH

                        <p>7. THE SECOND COMMITTEE RESOLUTIONS AND THREE IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE,
                            REFLECTING THE CONCERNS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, EXTEND UN EFFORTS
                            TO PROMOTE FULL AND EQUAL PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT
                            PROCESS. SPECIFIC MEASURES INCLUDE APPEALS TO GOVERNMENTS AND UN
                            AGENCIES TO PROVIDE WOMEN WITH EQUAL ACCESS TO CREDIT FACILITIES AND
                            VARIOUS FORMS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION AS WELL AS REQUESTS TO SET UP
                            PROCEDURES, INCLUDING IMPACT STATEMENTS (FOLLOWING THE U.S. INITIATIVE
                            IN MEXICO CITY), TO EVALUATE WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT
                            FIELD. REVIEW AND APPRAISAL OF PROGRESS UNDER THE PLAN OF ACTION IS TO
                            BE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
                            STRATEGY.</p>
                        <p>8. EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN THE UN SECRETARIAT IS THE THIRD ARAS FOR
                            ACTION. THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE FIFTH COMMITTEE, ALTHOUGH
                            CONSIDERABLY WATERED DOWN, SEEKS TO PROMOTE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF
                            POSITIONS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SECRETARIAT. THE DRAFT DECISION
                            ON THE JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, WAS DEFERRED.</p>
                        <p>9. THE OUTCOME IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE WAS INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF
                            FACTORS. FIRST, THE U.S. TOOK A STRONG STAND DURING SEVERAL WEEKS OF
                            INTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS, MAKING CLEAR THAT IT WOULD VOTE AGAINST THE
                            OMNIBUS RESOLUTION SHOULD IT BE TOO WEIGHED DOWN WITH EXTRANEOUS
                            POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. COORDINATION WITH THE EC-9 STRENGTHENED THE
                            WESTERN POSITION. MOREOVER, THE PRINCIPAL CO-SPONSORS --ORIGINALLY THE
                            PHILIPPINES, IRAN AND MEXICO WITH THE LATTER ADDITION OF EGYPT AND
                            JAMAICA--SOUTH TO ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE TEXT AND SUCCESSFULLY HEADED OFF
                            AMENDMENTS BY MORE RADICAL DELEGATIONS. DURING NEGOTIATIONS, FOR
                            EXAMPLE, REFERENCES TO CERDS AND THE <gloss target="#t_NIEO1"
                                >NIEO</gloss> WERE CHANGED TO MAKE THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION MORE
                            ACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. ALSO SIGNIFICANT IS THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS,
                            PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF PRESSURE FROM THE CLEVER PARLIAMENTARY TACTICS BY
                            THE PRINCIPAL CO-SPONSORS, ADVANCED THEIR IDEOLOGICAL CONCERNS THROUGH
                            SEPARATE RESOLUTIONS RATHER THAN BY AMENDING THE OMNIBUS DRAFT. THIS
                            REDUCED THE IDEOLOGICAL BAGGAGE OF THE OMNIBUS RESOLUTION. FINALLY,
                            ISRAEL DELAYED ITS INTERVENTION UNTIL THE ZIONISM ISSUE HAD ALREADY BEEN
                            RAISED BY THE <gloss target="#t_UAE1">UAE</gloss> WHICH ENDORSED
                            ANTI-ZIONISM MEASURES.</p>
                        <p>10. UNLIKE THE EXTENDED CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO RESOLUTIONS IN THE THIRD
                            COMMITTEE (SEVERAL WEEKS OF NEGOTIATION, 11 COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND ABOUT
                            90 SPEAKERS), THOSE IN THE SECOND COMMITTEE PASSED WITH VERY LITTLE
                            DEBATE. NOT ONLY WERE THERE FEWER RESOLUTIONS WITH NARROWER SCOPE, BUT
                            THEIR SUBSTANCE WAS LESS CONTROVERSIAL AND REFLECTED A WIDE DESIRE TO
                            FOCUS ON ASPECTS OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                        <p>11. THE TWO PROPOSALS IN THE FIFTH COMMITTEE EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT
                            PROBLEMS. THE AUSTRALIAN DRAFT ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN THE
                            SECRETARIAT RAN INTO <gloss target="#t_G771">G-77</gloss> OPPOSITION.
                            THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FEARED THAT ANY INCREASED EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN
                            IN THE SECRETARIAT WOULD BENEFIT ONLY THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND THUS
                            WOULD INTERFERE WITH REALIZING THEIR MORE IMPORTANT GOAL OF MORE
                            SECRETARIAT JOBS FOR THEIR OWN NATIONALS. THE RESOLUTIONS PASSED ONLY
                            AFTER THESE COUNTRIES STRIPPED IT OF PROVISIONS FOR SETTING TARGETS TO
                            INCREASE THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN IN THE SECRETARIAT TO 30 PERCENT BY
                            1980 AND FOR CREATING A NEW UN POST FOR SPECIAL ADVISER ON QUESTIONS OF
                            EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN. IN THEIR PLACE WERE ADDED PROVISIONS TO AID
                            "UNREPRESENTED" AND "UNDER- REPRESENTED" STATES. THE DRAFT DECISION ON
                            THE JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S STANDING COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN
                            IN THE SECRETARIAT WAS DEFERRED BECAUSE DELEGATIONS ARGUED THAT THE
                            FIFTH COMMITTEE WAS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE <gloss target="#t_JAC1"
                                >JAC</gloss> RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD NO
                            AUTHORITY OVER AN INTERNAL SECRETARIAT BODY. <lb/>

                            House<lb/>Washington, D.C. 20500</p>
                        <p>Dear Karen,</p>
                        <p>I am sure you followed with keen interest the decision of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly last month to launch a
                            Decade for Women, to carry out the plans laid in International Women's
                            Year. As a fellow-member of our delegation to the Mexico City
                            Conference, I thought you would like a first-hand account from the
                            "front lines."</p>
                        <p>The General Assembly got underway this fall with both pluses and minuses.
                            On the plus side, there was a strong carry-over of motivation and
                            determination from Mexico City: many delegations -- not least of them
                            our own -- came prepared to follow through. Also on the plus side was
                            the atmosphere generated by the Special Session on development and
                            international economic cooperation which took place the first two weeks
                            of September, on the eve of the regular session. As you know, the
                            Session can be chalked up as a very considerable success -- for the
                            United Nations and for the United States. A consensus resolution
                            emerged, showing that despite many deep-seated differences of outlook
                            between developed and developing nations, the two groups were able to
                            agree, at least for the time, to travel the road of cooperation and
                            compromise rather than confrontation. Thus we entered the regular
                            session of the Assembly in an aura of good feeling.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately the Assembly then took a disastrous political turn. The
                            references to Zionism in the Declaration of Mexico City were a foretaste
                            of things to come. The Third Committee -- concerned with social and
                            humanitarian affairs where the chief discussion of <gloss
                                target="#t_IWY1">IWY</gloss> took place -- became highly
                            politicized. It was this Committee that passed the grievous resolution
                            decreeing Zionism to be a form of racism and racial discrimination,
                            which cast a deep shadow over the whole Assembly session. Subsequent
                            issues in the Third Committee were likewise highly politicized. Thus
                            when the women's items, the last to be considered, came up in late
                            November, the atmosphere in the Committee was highly charged. It is a
                            tribute to the deep commitment of a broad spectrum of delegations that
                            discussion of the women's issues was on the whole businesslike and
                            germane.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MC5">Carmen Maymi</persName>, Director of the
                            Women's Bureau and a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Assembly, was
                            our spokesperson on women's issues. Her principal statements are
                            attached. <persName corresp="#p_HP1">Pat Hutar</persName>, who came as
                            frequently as other commitments permitted, Shirley <persName
                                corresp="#p_HSB1">Hendsch</persName>, and I were active particularly
                            in negotiations with other delegations and the Secretariat. Gayle
                            Oechslin, a young officer in the Mission who, while she had not been at
                            Mexico City, quickly familiarized herself with the substance, provided
                            invaluable staff support. So did other members of the Mission.</p>
                        <p>Our principal objective was General Assembly endorsement of the World
                            Plan of Action and the establishment of machinery to monitor its
                            implementation through a UN Decade for Women. We also wanted to focus on
                            the role of women in development, and on the United Nations itself as an
                            "equal rights" employer, following through on U.S. initiatives at the
                            Mexico City Conference. Of the ten resolutions and one committee
                            decision adopted by the Assembly, the United States supported eight,
                            voted against two, and abstained on one.</p>
                        <p>Our chief problem with the important omnibus resolution related to the
                            Zionism issue, referred to, as you recall, in the Declaration of Mexico
                            and in one of the thirty-five conference resolutions. Many delegations
                            wanted to endorse all action taken at the Conference; we of course did
                            not. What finally emerged from extensive negotiations was a workmanlike,
                            non-polemic resolution reflecting much effort on the part of the
                            third-world drafters. It went a considerable way, but not the whole way,
                            toward meeting our concerns.</p>
                        <p>The result was that the U.S. voted against operative paragraphs 1 and 2
                            of the omnibus resolution -- which could be interpreted as giving
                            blanket endorsement to all the documents of Mexico City -- and abstained
                            on the resolution as a whole. A sizable number of other countries joined
                            us in these votes, thus demonstrating their determination not to let the
                            laudable UN action for women be contaminated with the Zionism issue. In
                            our explanation of vote we made this clear, as well as the fact that we
                            wholeheartedly support the Decade for Women and implementation of the
                            World Plan of Action.</p>
                        <p>Initiatives on women in development won wide approval. The employment of
                            women in the United Nations fared less well. A resolution was passed,
                            but with some of its teeth extracted. There is still considerable
                            resistance to taking concrete steps within the United Nations itself to
                            improve the status of women employees, in part because developing
                            countries fear that an increase in women staff will come chiefly from
                            the developed countries.</p>
                        <p>These are difficult days in the United Nations. The fact that, at the
                            height of polemics and confrontation, nations were able to agree to move
                            forward on the Plan of Action and Decade for Women says much in my view
                            for the solidarity evident on the women's issues. The extent to which
                            the great goals of International Women's Year are reached will of course
                            depend primarily on member governments and on countless organizations
                            and individuals around the world. That record has yet to be written. But
                            the United Nations has shown that it can be an articulator of shared
                            ideals, a catalyst to strengthen motivation, reinforce determination,
                            and lay the groundwork for action.</p>
                        <p>Finally, let me say how much I enjoyed working with you at the
                            Conference. I was proud of our delegation and of the U.S. performance.
                            Certainly none of us has any illusions that what lies ahead will be
                            easy. But I hope and believe that ten years from now we shall look back
                            at Mexico City and feel that we participated in an historic event.</p>

                        <p>U.S. Center of IWY</p>
                        <p>The first direct U.S. response to the UN proclamation designating 1975 as
                            International Women's Year was made by an ad hoc committee of some 25
                            women in Federal government with responsibilities in the field of
                            women's activities who met informally in early 1973 to discuss ways in
                            which the U.S. Government and the private sector could implement the
                            objectives of IWY.</p>
                        <p>As a first step the group developed the concept for a clearinghouse unit
                            for IWY which, while receiving an initial grant from the government,
                            would be affiliated with private foundations, and would rely on private
                            funding. It would thus be outside the governmental system and could
                            serve as a bridge between government and non-governmental women's
                            organizations. In September, 1973, a grant agreement between the U.S.
                            Government and Meridian House International in Washington, D.C. was
                            signed for the establishment of the U.S. Center for International
                            Women's Year. Its mandate was to spread the word about IWY as widely as
                            possible throughout the United States and to stimulate appropriate
                            activities by non-governmental women's organizations. It was also to act
                            as a clearinghouse for the IWY activities of government agencies and
                            private groups until a formal government Commission for IWY was
                            authorized. The Center performed as a service unit reaching out to
                            organizations and communities across the country, providing materials,
                            information and suggestions so that they in turn could work together on
                            IWY programs adjusted to their needs and resources.</p>
                        <p>A successful campaign was also conducted by the Center urging Governors
                            and mayors to issue proclamations and to create State and local IWY
                            committees thus increasing participation in IWY activities at State and
                            local levels.</p>
                        <p>IWY committees and coalitions of interested women and organizations at
                            the local level became one of the strengths of the year. Their projects
                            and programs took many forms, but all were committed to increasing
                            awareness of IWY goals. As an outgrowth of these coalitions, many
                            resource centers for women were established to carry on specific
                            projects designed to improve the status and wellbeing of women. These
                            women's organizations also undertook the printing and distributions of a
                            simplified version of the World Plan of Action to women leaders, men's
                            and women's organizations, to universities and other educational
                            institutions.</p>
                        <p>In response to activity at the US Center, a special stamp commemorating
                            IWY was issued in 1975 by the U.S. Postal Service. The Center helped
                            finance its considerable outreach-by selling jewelry items which
                            reproduced the UN emblem of the IWY dove of peace. Throughout the
                            country, the emblem came to identify one IWY worker with another.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the work of the IWY Center, thousands of women throughout
                            the country who previously had no interest in the women's movement are
                            now concerned. The National Commission in drafting it's report (see
                            below) has given the needs and interests of these women a high
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>"The Percy Amendment"</p>
                        <p>A special IWY-oriented workshop, "IWY 1975 - Women in the World," was
                            held in the Spring of 1973 as part of an annual National Foreign Policy
                            Conference for leaders of nongovernmental organizations covered by the
                            Bureau of Public Affairs in the Department of State. One issue that
                            generated great interest, discussion, and ultimate action centered on
                            the need to integrate women into the national economies through the
                            Bilateral Foreign Assistance Program. A direct outgrowth of this
                            workshop was an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973
                            (popularly known as the Percy Amendment) which called for particular
                            attention to those programs, projects and activities which tend to
                            integrate women into the national economies of foreign countries thus
                            improving their status and assisting the total development effort.</p>
                        <p>The National Commission for IWY</p>
                        <p>In January 1974 President Nixon officially designated 1975 as
                            International Women's Year and called upon Congress and the people of
                            the U.S., government officials and interested groups to begin to provide
                            for the observance of IWY with practical and constructive measures for
                            the advancement of the status of women.</p>
                        <p>On January 9, 1975, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>
                            issued Executive Order #11832 establishing a National Commission on the
                            Observance of International Women's Year, 1975, and called upon it to
                            plan "an agenda for the future." In April of 1975, President Ford
                            appointed 35 women and men from the private sector with widely diverse
                            backgrounds and experience, and two Senators appointed by the President
                            of the Senate; and two Congresswomen appointed by the Speaker of the
                            House of Representatives to serve on the Commission. They were asked to
                            facilitate and coordinate U.S. Government participation in IWY and were
                            specifically charged to examine the conditions of life and the status of
                            U.S. women and report their findings, with appropriate recommendations,
                            for future government and non-government action. The life of the
                            Commission was extended to June 30, 1976, to complete its fact finding,
                            prepare its recommendations and file a report to the President.</p>
                        <p>At the Commission's first two meetings, over 200 non-governmental
                            organizations concerned with the status and activities of women
                            participated in a discussion of the specific issues on which the
                            Commission should work. Immediately after the Mexico Conference, the
                            Commission, armed with a clear mandate to implement the spirit and
                            intent of the World Plan of Action, began the work of identifying the
                            unmet social and economic needs of women in the United States. It
                            organized itself into the following 13 committees whose areas of concern
                            parallel many of the target areas outlined in the World Plan of Action:
                            Arts and Humanities, Child Development., Enforcement of the Laws, Equal
                            Rights Amendment, Government Organization Structure, Homemaker,
                            International Interdependence, Media, Reproductive Freedom, Special
                            Problems of Women, UN-<gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> Conventions,
                            Women in Employment, Women in Power.</p>
                        <p>Committee membership included Commission members as well as participants
                            from the private sector. All committees heard testimony from expert
                            witnesses and some held public hearings. All meetings of the Commission
                            and the committees were open to the public.</p>
                        <p>As a result of nearly 12 months study of women's issues, the committees
                            drafted 115 specific recommendations, almost all of which the Commission
                            approved and transmitted to the President of the United States. In
                            general, these recommendations have three characteristics: 1) They are
                            addressed to Federal or State governments or to major social
                            institutions; 2) They are of obvious benefit to women; and 3) They are
                            reasonably realistic and capable of being achieved. The recommendations
                            provide the necessary specifics which will serve to enhance the status
                            and role of women in the decade to come. Major emphasis is placed on the
                            enforcement and/or revision of laws already in existence.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations </p>
                        <p>The World Plan of Action refers to the necessity of enactment of
                            appropriate laws to eliminate discriminatory practices toward women.
                            Since our particular national problems are the enforcement o existing
                            laws and the modification of attitudes and policies that reinforce
                            traditional stereotypes about women, the National Commission chose to
                            concentrate its study and recommendations in the following areas:</p>
                        <p>...Greater participation of women in U.S. foreign affairs agencies and
                            international delegations and on U.S. delegations to international
                            conferences</p>
                        <p>...Labor union action to review the effect of their policies on women and
                            to bring more women into union membership and into decision-making
                            positions in those unions.</p>
                        <p>...Moving more women into positions of deciding public policy through
                            election to public office and appointment to local, State and Federal
                            boards and commissions.</p>
                        <p>...Full integration of women in business-related government activities
                            such as extension of credit, loans to small business women, etc., as a
                            matter of public policy.</p>
                        <p>…Expansion of the concept of "equal pay for equal work" to "equal pay for
                            work of equal value."</p>
                        <p>…Revision of the nation's laws so that they are based on the principle
                            that a homemaker's contribution is equal in value to the contribution of
                            the spouse who works outside the home.</p>
                        <p>...Rigorous enforcement by the Federal Communication Commission of
                            non-discrimination laws in TV and radio and adoption of a suggested "ten
                            Guidelines" on the portrayal and treatment of women by the media.</p>
                        <p>…Procedures which will give women better treatment in the arts and
                            humanities in such areas as judging practices, salary differentials,
                            grants by Government and foundations, and job opportunities.</p>
                        <p>…More voluntary child care programs and services to meet the needs of all
                            working parents, regardless of income.</p>
                        <p>...Improving life for the older woman, the woman offender, women with
                            physical and mental health problems, and women from racial and ethnic
                            minorities.</p>
                        <p>…Revision of State divorce laws to provide for more equitable division of
                            property, maintenance, child custody and support and enforcement of
                            support orders.</p>
                        <p>…Combine rape and other "sexual" crimes of violence into one category of
                            crime which applies to all such crimes regardless of the sex of the
                            attacker or the victim; and removing requirements of corroborative
                            evidence or the past sexual conduct of the victim in rape
                            prosecutions.</p>
                        <p>Stating its belief that the moral decisions relating to reproduction are
                            rightfully the responsibility of individual women, the Commission also
                            supported the series of Supreme Court decisions guaranteeing
                            reproductive freedom to women and condemned any interference, open or
                            subtle, with a woman's right to control her own reproduction. The
                            Commission also urged all branches of Federal, State and local
                            governments to give the highest priority to compliance with these
                            Supreme Court decisions and to make available all methods of family
                            planning to women unable to take advantage of private facilities.</p>
                        <p>Equal Rights Amendment </p>
                        <p>Prompt ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment was another
                            recommendation of the Commission. As presently interpreted by the U.S.
                            Supreme Court, the U.S. Constitution does not provide women full
                            equality under the law. In 1972, the U.S. Congress passed the Equal
                            Rights Amendment, which when passed, will become the 27th Amendment of
                            the Constitution, and submitted it to the 50 State legislatures for
                            ratification. At present, 34 States have ratified this amendment, which
                            essentially, and with very limited exceptions, will prohibit State
                            legislatures and the Federal Congress from enacting any law or adopting
                            any official practices that make distinctions based on sex.</p>
                        <p>For example, under the Equal Rights Amendment, public schools could not
                            be restricted to one sex. Women could not be restrained from holding any
                            type of job. They would also be admitted to military services under the
                            same standards as men.</p>
                        <p>Four more States are needed to ratify the Amendment by March, 1979. To
                            accelerate the process, the National Commission on the Observance of
                            International Women's Year helped bring together the many organizations
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_ERA1">ERA</gloss> to support a single
                            organization, called ERAmerica, to coordinate their efforts and to unify
                            the many existing ERA educational and public information programs in the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>A Voice For the Future </p>
                        <p>Commission members were in agreement that a single mechanism which would
                            represent the women of America and give them an effective voice in
                            government is needed to ensure that the work of the Commission and the
                            goals of International Women's Year are brought to fruition. After much
                            study of alternative ways to integrate women's interests into our
                            governmental pattern, the Commission decided to recommend legislation
                            which would create a Cabinet level office which would be responsible for
                            the functions of the many and scattered programs for women in the
                            Federal government. Such a cabinet office would become the vehicle by
                            which women will finally realize the goals of the Commission and enable
                            women to be full and equal participants in American life.</p>
                        <p>The full Commission Final Report, "…To Form a More Perfect Union…"
                            Justice for American Women, will be presented to the President on June
                            30, 1976, and will be available to the public at that time. The main
                            text is written in narrative style, using actual case histories to
                            describe those clusters of problems which are the greatest barriers to
                            equal participation of women in all aspects of U.S. life and
                            decision-making. The largest section of the report contains the actual
                            recommendations being made by the Commission, with background
                            documentation which justifies the recommendations.</p>
                        <p>IWY Interdepartmental Task Force</p>
                        <p>U.S. implementation of those parts of the World Plan of Action which are
                            relevant to our stage of national development will also be facilitated
                            through the work of the IWY Interdepartmental Task Force, a parallel
                            body to the Commission authorized in the same Executive Order which
                            created a National Commission. Membership consisted of two
                            representatives from the 50 major Federal agencies and departments whose
                            job was to plan and implement projects within the Federal government for
                            the domestic observance of IWY.</p>
                        <p>Agencies were asked to analyze the World Plan of Action in terms of its
                            relevance to all on-going policies and programs. They were further asked
                            to develop specific five-year goals for the United States as suggested
                            in paragraph 46 of the World Plan which singles out the need for
                            measurable achievement in such various areas as equal access to
                            education, increased employment opportunities, increased participation
                            of women in policy making positions at all levels.</p>
                        <p>As a first step in developing these goals, the Task force undertook, as
                            its principal mission, a Survey of government programs to ascertain
                            where women stand as beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries. The
                            inspiration for this innovative approach to Federal programming came
                            from a U.S. sponsored resolution at the Mexico City Conference which
                            called upon the United Nations to assess its programs and activities in
                            terms of impact on women. Each constituent agency on the Task Force was
                            asked to examine a representative sampling of its programs in terms of
                            their impact upon women, and if that impact was not judged to be
                            positive, alternative programs were to be proposed.</p>
                        <p>Much information which proved useful to the National Commission in
                            forming its recommendations was contained in the impact evaluation
                            reports. In addition, many positive suggestions as to where and how
                            women's interests can be better served by government program planners
                            was generated by the impact process.</p>
                        <p>In particular, the reports pointed up serious deficiencies in data
                            collection and analysis in all government agencies. To correct this
                            situation, the IWY Commission has recommended to the President that all
                            Federal agencies be required to collect, tabulate, cross-tabulate and
                            analyze data relating to persons by sex, ethnicity, face and where
                            appropriate by age, income and other indicators of disadvantaged
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>The impact evaluation reports indicated that this special IWY effort
                            allowed only a preliminary glimpse of a complicated array of issues
                            relating to women which should be addressed as part of each agency's
                            ongoing policy review.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, if long-term results are to be expected in increasing government
                            sensitivity to women's needs, if government programs are to respond
                            directly to those needs in the "Decade for Women" which we have entered,
                            then the process of assessing the impact on women of various programs
                            and delivery structures should be regularized under some mechanism of
                            the Federal government. Consequently, the Commission has recommended to
                            the President that the Office of Management and Budget require the
                            departments and agencies of the Federal government to continue to
                            consider the impact of their programs on women in the United States as
                            part of the regular budget and review process of the government.</p>
                        <p>Signs of Progress </p>
                        <p>As a result of the activities generated by IWY, some progress can already
                            be noted toward achieving the goal of equality between men and
                            women:</p>
                        <p>...In response to a strong resolution adopted by the National Commission,
                            the U.S. Senate ratified the Conventions on the Political Rights of
                            Women in January, 1976.</p>
                        <p>...In early 1976 a series of strengthening amendments to the Equal Credit
                            Opportunity Act of 1974 were passed by the U.S. Congress.</p>
                        <p>...In response to a recommendation of the Commission, the Secretary of
                            the Treasury has testified in favor of a measure which would abolish
                            estate and gift taxes between man and wife.</p>
                        <p>...A move to extend social security coverage to the homemaker is gaining
                            support in and outside the government.</p>
                        <p>...Evidence submitted to the IWY Interdepartmental Task Force indicates
                            that affirmative efforts are being made by the government to bring women
                            into the skilled trades and the non-traditional careers which have been
                            male-dominated.</p>
                        <p>...The Census Bureau of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
                            has begun implementing a Commission recommendation that the government
                            collect data on the economic arrangements resulting from divorce. This
                            data will indicate the extent to which the government is involved in
                            contributing to child support in default of parental support, especially
                            that of fathers.</p>
                        <p>...The Bureau of the Census of the U.S. Department of Commerce in April,
                            1976, published the first comprehensive census report on women. This is
                            a landmark step in documenting the degree to which women are integrated
                            in the social and economic life of the country.</p>
                        <p>Adequate enforcement of laws already on the books, and modification of
                            attitudes about women is a slow process. However, the many
                            recommendations of the Commission if carried out, will in the long run
                            have a profound effect on our society. The Commission has laid out a
                            blueprint for change in all aspects of U.S. national life and
                            decision-making. It is now up to American women to take advantage of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The National Women's Conference </p>
                        <p>The National Women's Conference is one vehicle for taking advantage of
                            the opportunities offered by the IWY Commission It is also another,
                            effective way to acquaint American women with the objectives of the
                            World Plan of Action. Authorized in December, 1975, by Public Law
                            94-167, the conference process involves a series of State and
                            Territorial conferences to be held throughout 1977, to be followed by a
                            national conference no later than November 30, 1977.</p>
                        <p>The tenure of the IWY Commission has been extended to March 31, 1978, and
                            it will be responsible for planning and structuring the conferences. It
                            is also mandated to submit the findings and recommendations of the
                            conferences to the President and to both Houses of Congress.</p>
                        <p>The conferences will be composed of representatives of local, State,
                            regional and national institutions and organizations and members of the
                            general public, with special emphasis on the representation of
                            low-income women, members of diverse racial, ethnic, and religious
                            groups and women of all ages. The goals of the conference will be to
                            assess the progress that has been made to date by both the private and
                            public sectors in promoting equality between men and women in all
                            aspects of life in the United States; to identify the barriers that
                            prevent women from participating fully and equally in all aspects of
                            national life; to develop recommendations for removing these barriers
                            and timetables for the achievement of these objectives.</p>
                        <p>The conference will give many women at the grass roots level an
                            opportunity to examine the lives of women within the United States and
                            to build an appreciation of the contributions women have made, are
                            making, and can continue to make to National life.</p>
                        <p>Another goal of the conferences will need to be that of education...the
                            sharing of information and the building of understanding on women's
                            issues. Since not all the conference participants will be starting from
                            the same knowledge and experience, broader issues, not necessarily
                            resulting in immediate action must be studied. In some States, work is
                            already in progress toward developing specific State Plans of Action,
                            modeled on the World Plan of Action, to be presented at the State
                            conferences for discussion and subsequent action.</p>
                        <p>The State and national conference process has the further goal of
                            deepening an understanding of the concerns that bind women in this
                            country to women in other nations. Such global priority issues as the
                            production and distribution of food, the growth and distribution of
                            population throughout the world, the utilization and conservation of
                            energy and the accelerated transportation and communication of ideas and
                            people across the face of the earth will necessarily be included on the
                            State and national agendas of the conferences.</p>
                        <p>Each of these issues is of particular concern to women. Their views and
                            knowledge and judgment need to be incorporated into the solutions that
                            are developed by decision-makers.</p>
                        <p>The State and national conferences present an ideal opportunity for women
                            to identify links between their own domestic concerns of those of a more
                            global nature. This exploration of linkages and the meaning of
                            interdependence will facilitate women's active participation in the
                            structuring of a more just and human world.</p>
                        <p>If the State and national conferences do, as planned, recognize the
                            contributions of women to U.S. development and the strengthening of
                            world peace, identify barriers to full equality and recommend means of
                            removing them, set up a timetable for carrying out those
                            recommendations, and, above all, reinforce the sense of cohesion and
                            purpose--then the conferences will have made a real contribution to
                            improving the equality of life for all our citizens.</p>

                        <p>Twenty-Sixth Session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commission
                            on the Status of Women</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND PAPER</p>
                        <p>THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF POPULATION MATTERS TO THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND
                            TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF WOMEN IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT </p>
                        <p>PROBLEM:</p>
                        <p>Though population is not listed per see as an item on the Provisional
                            Agenda for the Twenty-Sixth Session of the UN Commission on the Status
                            of Women, it is embedded in all the general items listed on the agenda.
                            It is important that the United States Delegation to the Twenty-Sixth
                            Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women be au courant with
                            U.S. international population policy as it relates to the status of
                            women and the involvement of women in socio-economic development and
                            that appropriate language be inserted into documentation emanating from
                            the Session.</p>
                        <p>RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ISSUE TO THE UNITED STATES:</p>
                        <p>The United States government has been concerned at the highest level with
                            international population policy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GM3"
                                >Marshall Green</persName>, Coordinator of Population Affairs, is
                            Chairman of an Interagency Task force on Population Policy. (See
                            September 10 speech attached.)</p>
                        <p>The United States recognizes that population growth is inextricably
                            linked to all phases of socio-economic development, including
                            unemployment/underemployment, environmental degradation, food
                            production, problems of rapid urbanization, and improvement in the
                            status of women and their active participation as beneficiaries and as
                            agents of change in community and national life.</p>
                        <p>The United States is committed in the United Nations General Assembly
                            (Secretary Kissinger's speech before the 7th Special Session on the
                            UNGA) and through bilateral and multilateral assistance programs to
                            assist the peoples of less developed countries in the above interrelated
                            areas of concern.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has a Congressional Mandate, the
                            Percy Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, which "calls for
                            particular attention to those programs, projects, and activities which
                            tend to integrate women into the national economies of foreign
                            countries, thus, improving their status and assisting the total
                            development effort."</p>
                        <p>UNITED STATES POSITION:</p>
                        <p>1. The United States should discreetly act as a catalyst in negotiations
                            concerning population and interrelated issues as they affect the status
                            and role of women.</p>
                        <p>2. The main thrust of U.S. Delegation argumentation should be that over
                            135 nations agreed to the principle of family planning at the World
                            Population Conference and the World Conference of International Women's
                            Year as related to socioeconomic development and elevation of the status
                            of women. In no way should this language be weaker than at these two
                            Conferences. The World Plans of Action of both Conferences set forth the
                            correlation of population factors with socio- economic development and
                            improvement in the status of women; both Plans are mutually
                            reinforcing.</p>
                        <p>3. It is especially important that the Draft Convention on the
                            Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (Item 3(a)) be amended to
                            include language as strong as that in the two Plans of Action referred
                            to above. Accordingly, the U.S. Delegation should introduce or support
                            amendments, as made by other delegations, to the Preamble and Article 10
                            (e).</p>
                        <p>4. In reviewing Agenda Item 3(b) on the implementation of the Declaration
                            on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the U.S. Delegation
                            should keep in mind that the indirect reference made to aspects of
                            family planning was the first such reference made in an international
                            instrument emanating from the Commission on the Status of Women. Such
                            reluctance in language used is understandable in the time frame of 1967
                            but not in 1976 following the progress made over the past decade. It
                            would be appropriate for the U.S. Delegation to mention this fact in
                            discussion of the agenda item.</p>
                        <p>5. The U.S. Delegation should ensure that Population, as it relates to
                            the status of women and socio-economic development, be included in all
                            planning programs for the UN Decade on Women, in the Agenda for the
                            Twenty-Seventh Session of the Commission, and for the 1980
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>6. In discussing population issues, either in open fora or in private,
                            U.S. Delegation members should avoid the semantics of "population
                            control," which is not the same as a woman's right to control her own
                            fertility (without which she cannot have equality). A few sensitive
                            Latin American and African countries prefer such terms as "child
                            spacing," "mother and child care," or "responsibility in
                            parenthood."</p>
                        <p>DISCUSSION: 1. Scope.</p>
                        <p>Family planning is central to improvement in the quality of life for
                            women everywhere, which, in turn, makes possible their participation in
                            socio-economic development within the framework of their families,
                            communities, and nations. Unless women are given the information and
                            means to control their own fertility, have alternatives to
                            child-bearing, and lead healthier and more productive lives, the
                            majority will be forever prey to the ravages of ignorance, poverty, and
                            servitude -- their current condition in the poorer segments of the less
                            developed nations.</p>
                        <p>Family planning is incorporated in maternal and child health programs, in
                            community and national socio-economic developmental plans, and in those
                            of most United Nations bodies and Specialized Agencies. It often
                            spearheads a variety of community development projects organized by
                            indigenous and/or international private and voluntary organizations.</p>
                        <p>Thus, matters concerning women's control of their own fertility -- of
                            major significance to improvement of their status and consequent
                            involvement in community and national life on their own behalf -- must
                            be an integral part of the deliberations of such meetings as the
                            Twenty-Sixth Session of the Commission on the Status of Women. It is the
                            responsibility of the United States Delegation to pursue this task with
                            delicate negotiation and diplomacy, especially with delegations from
                            member governments such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, India,
                            Egypt, Kenya, Liberia, Zaire, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Norway,
                            Finland, and the United Kingdom. Otherwise, these issues will be shunted
                            to the background as more glamorous and popular issues are given
                            prominence.</p>
                        <p>2. The Interagency Task Force on Population Policy.</p>
                        <p>The Interagency Task Force view is that the United States lend even
                            stronger support to worldwide efforts for the improved status of women
                            and for their active participation in community and national life.</p>
                        <p>The Interagency, Task Force recognizes, as do innumerable studies,* that
                            improving the status of women, thereby increasing their basic
                            opportunities, is apparently of fundamental importance in lowering
                            fertility.</p>
                        <p>* Including the Report of the Special Rapporteur, Helvi Sipila, appointed
                            by the UN Economic and Social Council under Resolution 1326 (XLIV) on
                            Status of Women and Family Planning, submitted to the Twenty-Fifth
                            Session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.</p>
                        <p>The Task Force also gives particular attention to:</p>
                        <p>(a) strong direction from national and provincial leaders;</p>
                        <p>(b) emphasis on community participation to root family planning in
                            village life; and,</p>
                        <p>(c) integration of health, family planning, and nutrition, including
                            training of competent multi-purpose paramedics to provide fellow
                            villagers with family planning as well as other medical services
                            (advocated by Secretary Kissinger at the 7th Special Session of the
                            UNGA).</p>
                        <p>The Task Force provides interagency policy direction for U.S. bilateral
                            and multilateral assistance and recognizes that all matters which affect
                            the status of women are part and parcel of the above three-tiered
                            approach. Such matters include:</p>
                        <p>-- female education and training of various types and levels;</p>
                        <p>-- female employment, especially in areas which will not compete
                            unnecessarily with men;</p>
                        <p>-- maternal and child health;</p>
                        <p>-- nutritional status of women and children;</p>
                        <p>-- women's participation in agricultural improvement;</p>
                        <p>-- laws which affect women's status, such as age at marriage, family
                            planning, etc.</p>
                        <p>These are the elements which form the totality of the concept we know as
                            the "status of women." They affect women as (1) beneficiaries, and (2)
                            actors in researching, planning, promoting, and conveying demographic
                            and family planning policies and programs elementary to raising the
                            status of women.</p>
                        <p>3. Draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination </p>
                        <p>The Preamble to this very important document should reflect rights and
                            responsibilities as contained in the World Population Plan of Action and
                            in the World Plan of Action of International Women's Year.</p>
                        <p>The World Population Plan of Action states in paragraph 14(f):</p>
                        <p>"All couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and
                            responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the
                            information, education and means to do so; the responsibility of couples
                            and individuals in the exercise of this right takes into account the
                            needs of their living and future children, and their responsibilities
                            towards the community;"</p>
                        <p>The World Plan of Action of the World Conference of International Women's
                            Year reads in paragraph 19:</p>
                        <p>"Individuals and couples have the right freely and responsibly to
                            determine the number and spacing of their children and to have the
                            information and the means to do so. The exercise of this right is basic
                            to the attainment of any real equality between the sexes and without its
                            achievement women are disadvantaged in their attempt to benefit from
                            other reforms."</p>
                        <p>Article 10 (e) should guarantee access to information, education, and
                            means to practice family planning. The responsibility of governments to
                            execute programs should be stressed.</p>

                            PROGRAM ISSUES</p>
                        <p>SUMMARY: THE PURPOSE OF THIS CABLE IS TO PROVIDE A BALANCE SHEET OF THE
                            NAIROBI CONFERENCE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE
                            PROGRAMMATIC AREAS, WHICH TOO OFTEN TEND TO BE OVERSHADOWED BY POLITICAL
                            DEEDS AND RHETORIC THAT USUALLY CAPTURE PRESS HEADLINES. THE FACT IS
                            THAT THE DELIBERATIONS IN THE PROGRAMMATIC AREAS (I.E., SCIENCE,
                            EDUCATION, AND CULTURE) WENT RATHER SMOOTHLY, MOSTLY WITHOUT MUCH
                            POLITICAL OVERTONES, THUS MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO
                            (I) MAKE A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION IN THE SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION OF
                            UNESCO PROGRAM, (II) ADVANCE OUR POSITION OF INFLUENCE IN UNESCO PROGRAM
                            SECTORS, AND (III) ACHIEVE MOST OF OUR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. MUCH OF THE
                            CREDIT FOR THESE SOLID ACCOMPLISHMENTS GOES TO THE PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS
                            (MOSTLY ADVISORS) OF US DELEGATION, ALL OF WHOM HAD PRIOR, FIRST HAND
                            EXPERIENCE WITH UNESCO AFFAIRS. END OF SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is information unrelated to women]</p>
                        <p>VI. UNESCO AND STATUS OF WOMEN</p>
                        <p>1. THE GENERAL CONFERENCE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION SPONSORED BY
                            THE UNITED STATES, PHILIPPINES AND MEXICO CONCERNING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE
                            STATUS OF WOMEN, AND IN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
                            IN ALL COUNTRIES. UNESCO WITH ITS SPECIAL COMPETENCE IN EDUCATION,
                            SOCIAL SCIENCE, CULTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS HAS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS
                            TO MAKE IN IMPROVING THE STATUS OF WOMEN, IN LESSENING INEQUALITIES OF
                            TREATMENT WHICH WOMEN RECEIVE, AND IN INCREASING THE PARTICIPATION BY
                            WOMEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -- BOTH AS CONTRIBUTORS AND
                            BENEFICIARIES.</p>
                        <p>2. THE US TOOK THE LEAD IN THE 18TH GENERAL CONFERENCE IN GETTING A
                            UNANIMOUS DECISION ADOPTED FOR A BROAD POLICY STATEMENT AND ON GUIDANCE
                            FOR A PROGRAM OF ACTION BY UNESCO OVER THE COMING YEARS TO ADDRESS THE
                            PROBLEMS FACING WOMEN IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE
                            RESOLUTION ON WOMEN AT THE 19TH GENERAL CONFERENCE -- ALSO ADOPTED
                            UNANIMOUSLY -- GIVES IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UP ATTENTION TO THE PRIOR
                            RESOLUTION. IT CALLS ON UNESCO TO LAUNCH SPECIAL PROJECTS FOR WOMEN AND,
                            PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT CALLS FOR ALL PROJECTS TO ADDRESS HOW THE
                            ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT WOMEN AS BOTH PARTICIPANTS AND
                            BENEFICIARIES. THIS IS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE INCLUSION OF IMPACT
                            STATEMENTS ON WOMEN FOR ALL PROJECT DOCUMENTS. THIS SHOULD DO MUCH TO
                            SENSITIZE UNESCO TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT ITS ACTIONS HAVE ON WOMEN. IT IS
                            IN LINE WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF THE PERCY AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN
                            ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION FOR BOTH THE U.S. BILATERAL PROGRAMS AND FOR
                            MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THE STATUS AND
                            PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT. THE RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS FOR AN
                            ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS TO BE USED TO ASSIST UNESCO IN ADDRESSING
                            THE NEEDS OF WOMEN. </p>
