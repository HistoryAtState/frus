                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>

                        <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless

                        <p>On January 3, 1955, the Department of State announced that the United
                            States Government had extended existing travel regulations “for Soviet
                            citizens stationed in the United States to include all Soviet citizens
                            in possession of valid Soviet passports other than Soviet citizen
                            officers and employees of the U.N. Secretariat while their conduct is a
                            responsibility of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.” The
                            regulations established closed areas in the United States comparable to
                            those closed to travel by Americans and other foreigners in the Soviet
                            Union. For texts of the announcement and the note presented on January 3
                            to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, along with five enclosures
                            specifying the areas closed to Soviet citizens, see Department of State

                        <p>On January 19, the Department of State announced the institution of
                            regulations governing photography and sketching in the United States by
                            Soviet citizens, which the Department said were comparable to those the
                            Soviet Union instituted on February 11, 1954, regarding photography and
                            sketching by foreign citizens in the Soviet Union. For texts of this
                            announcement, and the note presented that day by the Department to the

                        <p>[Here follows a paragraph listing the participants at the meeting.]</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the meeting of the National Security Council, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> passed out copies of an
                            analysis indicating the greatly increased number of meetings of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> and of actions taken by the
                            Council in the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            Administration as compared to its predecessor. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> observed that this was an
                            indication that “the workman is worthy of his hire” and was proof of how
                            hard the Council had worked for President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>. He said, however, that the Secretary of
                            State had commented on this analysis by stating that a quantitative
                            study of the National Security Council threw no light on the quality of
                            its membership and their actions. Amidst laughter, the President turned
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and said,
                            what you mean is that this analysis merely shows that we are now more
                            verbose. (More laughter.)</p>

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence first pointed out to the Council
                            stresses and strains which had recently become visible in the Moscow
                            scene. There was now occurring the largest call-back of Soviet
                            Ambassadors abroad to Moscow since the death of STALIN. This would
                            indicate quite a diplomatic pow-wow. To judge from their identities, the
                            Ambassadors would probably concentrate their discussion on the
                            London–Paris pacts<note n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">Reference is to the

                            respect to Formosa and the Pacific, but they had been summoned to Moscow
                            prior to the issuance of the President’s statement to the Congress
                            respecting Formosa.<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">For text of this message,

                        <p>Another significant fact regarding developments in the Soviet Union was
                            the summoning into session of the Supreme Soviet early in February, a
                            full month ahead of the normal time when that body convened.
                            Significance might be attached to this fact despite the rubber-stamp
                            quality of the Supreme Soviet.</p>

                        <p>In addition, continued Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, there still was
                            considerable publicity in <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> regarding the degree of emphasis to be
                            placed by the Soviet Government on increasing the production of
                            consumers goods, as opposed to emphasis on heavy industry.</p>
                        <p>Discussing the content of some of this publicity, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> had been plugging heavy industry, whereas until
                            recently <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> had championed greater
                            production of consumers goods. This had now ceased, and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pravda</hi> line had apparently won out. In connection
                            with this victory it was possible to attach some significance to the
                            removal of <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> as Minister of
                            Internal Trade of the USSR.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s resignation as Soviet
                                Minister of Trade was announced on January 25. He retained his
                                position as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.</note>
                            While there were no indications that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName> had been purged or otherwise disgraced, his
                            removal from his trade post could be an indication that the role of
                            heavy industry was again coming to the fore in the Soviet Union to the
                            disadvantage of the recent emphasis on the production of consumers
                            goods.</p>
                        <p>A final straw in the wind was the restoration to grace of Andreyev,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">A.A. Andreyev had been deposed from the
                                Politburo in 1952.</note> an old Bolshevik who had been in discard
                            for some considerable time. It was possible to interpret his
                            reappearance in authority as a sop to <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> and a slap at <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. In any case, concluded Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, all these indications may point to a
                            return by the Soviet Union to a harsher line, as opposed to the recent
                            stress on co-existence and a “soft” policy.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of his briefing, certain minor splits in the text were
                            discussed and dealt with by the Council. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> then invited attention to paragraph 4–c, which
                            read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“c. Thereby convincing the Communist rulers that aggression will
                                    not serve their interests, that it will not pay. So long as the
                                    Soviets are uncertain of their ability to neutralize the U.S.
                                    nuclear-air retaliatory power, there is little reason to expect
                                    them to initiate general war or actions which they believe would
                                    carry appreciable risk of general war, and thereby endanger the
                                    regime and the security of the USSR.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>For reasons, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>, that
                            he could not understand, the Joint Chiefs of Staff wished to delete
                            paragraph 4–c. While Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>
                            believed that this paragraph was not vital to the understanding of the
                            proposed political warfare strategy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505, he would have imagined that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff would have desired to include this paragraph, the more so since
                            its thought was integral to subparagraphs 4–a and –b which preceded it.
                            He accordingly asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> if he would explain the position taken by the
                            Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that
                            personally he didn’t care at all whether paragraph 4–c was or was not
                            included. Indeed, he had not himself taken part in the discussion of
                            this paper with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Beyond that, he added that he
                            was altogether confused by all these wordy papers regarding the
                            exploitation of Soviet vulnerabilities, indicating the view that such
                            papers as these were of very doubtful value to the National Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> explained to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 and its ancillary reports had been
                            intended to provide guidance in the precise field of exploiting Soviet
                            vulnerabilities, a field in which the need of guidance had been felt for
                            a number of years. Thereafter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> went on to explain what the Planning Board
                            recommended as a suitable Council action on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505. (This proposed action is set forth in the “Note
                            by the Executive Secretary” at the beginning of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505.<note n="7" xml:id="d2fn7">Not printed.</note>) In
                            the course of summarizing the Planning Board recommendation for Council
                            action, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> said that he
                            wished to propose a slight modification in the recommended Council
                            action, which change had resulted from a conversation he had had the
                            previous evening with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Nelson
                                Rockefeller</persName> and Director <persName corresp="#p_HRR1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>, rather than to a
                            subcommittee of the Operations Coordinating Board.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> pointed out that,
                            working independently of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName>, both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> had come to the same conclusions as Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> respecting the best
                            means of effectively implementing this political warfare strategy. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            the revised proposal was a “perfectly feasible” way of proceeding, while
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said that his
                            long-awaited report on a mechanism for coordinating within the Executive
                            Branch economic, psychological, and political warfare and foreign
                            information, was almost ready for consideration by the National Security
                                Council.<note n="8" xml:id="d2fn8">Reference is to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>’ report to the President on
                                March 3 and the establishment by the President on March 10 of a
                                Planning Coordination Group (PCG) headed by <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then asked the Secretary
                            of State for any comment he wished to make on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            found it difficult to deal confidently with the vast number of
                            abstractions which inevitably arose in such a report as this. Even if he
                            didn’t really understand the abstractions, and particularly the splits
                            in abstractions, he said he was prepared to admit that these
                            abstractions could be very important. Accordingly, he said he would
                            “pass” at this point in the game.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> attempted once again to
                            explain the heart of the political warfare strategy proposed in this
                            paper, and indicated that the “heart” of it was to be found in
                            subparagraphs 3–c and 3–d, which he insisted expressed a really
                            significant <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss>, and which
                            subparagraphs he read again to the Council.… Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> conceded that at least he could
                            understand this concrete manifestation of the theoretical strategy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that he tended
                            to share the feeling expressed by the Secretary of State on <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505. While he would be willing to vote
                            for approval of the report, he would not be sure exactly what he was
                            proposing to recommend. He would therefore suggest clarifying language
                            for insertion between subparagraphs c–(l) and c–(2) of the Note by the
                            Executive Secretary. After reading his proposed new language, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said it would
                            provide the Council with a much clearer <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                >idea</gloss> of the direction in which this political strategy was
                            moving, by giving the Council a chance to look at specific illustrative
                            measures and programs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> indicated a lack of
                            sympathy with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>’s
                            proposal, and again apologized to the Council for his apparent inability
                            to explain the contents of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 more
                            clearly. He tried once again by suggesting that the heart of this paper
                            consisted of a <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0036"/>set of guiding
                            principles for the exploitation of Soviet and satellite vulnerabilities,
                            laid down for the guidance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName>’s committee in its task of formulating
                            programs and seeing that these programs were carried out.… Finally, said
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>, it was plain to him
                            that we did not want a lot more paper work to come out of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName>’s committee. Once in their
                            hands, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 would promptly enter the
                            area of operations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that discussion of this paper was taking place in the
                            context of the cold war. While of course we needed paper programs, we
                            could not keep on planning indefinitely for the future. We must have
                            prompt action. He personally could see nothing particularly wrong with
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505. It was in general
                            following the right line. The United States was not in a position to
                            state that it would promote revolution in the Soviet Union What we must
                            try to do is win “these guys” over. Accordingly, he believed it was
                            right to give this paper to the <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> group and have them report to the Council
                            from time to time by way of informing the Council of what the Special
                            Committee had been doing. The progress reports should by all means be
                            specific, and the President was sure that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> was precisely the right man
                            to chair this committee to implement <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5505.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said … Was he therefore correct in supposing that the
                            strategy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 would not
                            necessarily rule out resort to revolutionary methods if they seemed
                            likely to be successful? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> answered that such methods would not necessarily
                            be ruled out if they were likely to achieve success.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that if the Council did approve the
                            present report it should not expect the new Special Committee merely to
                            carry out this policy slavishly, but to report to the Council on other
                            unforeseen possibilities, as well as proposed measures that had turned
                            out wrong. In response to the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505 called for a continuous review of the strategy
                            which it proposed. He added that he would get together with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> in order to agree on
                            a wording for his proposed change in the Council action on <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out with emphasis that
                            the established pattern of progress reports by the Operations
                            Coordinating Board covered exactly what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                                >Flemming</persName> had in mind in suggesting this change.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> both stated that they did
                            not wish the guidance provided by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5505, on the exploitation of Soviet vulnerabilities along evolutionary
                            rather than revolutionary lines, to destroy all possibility of seizing
                            opportunities for exploiting a different type of strategy if such
                            opportunities clearly presented <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0037"
                            />themselves. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> replied
                            that this possibility was not excluded in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5505.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then added that
                            he had a few notes on this paper, from which he would like to speak to
                            the Council. He said that he was “thoroughly sold” on having the
                            implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 placed in the
                            hands of this small group headed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName>; but he hoped that they would use their best
                            judgment in meeting various specific situations. In general, he had
                            found <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 “a little too wordy and
                            verbose”. As he saw it, there were several differing situations to be
                            observed throughout the world: the situation in the USSR, in the
                            European satellites, in Communist China, in the satellites of Communist
                            China, and among “weak allies” of the U.S. elsewhere. If he were
                            carrying out this task he would operate quite differently in these
                            different areas. Obviously the USSR and Communist China represented
                            “touchy ground”. Before carrying out any operations in these areas we
                            should do our best to realize the probable reaction. Other areas were
                            less sensitive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            also believed, he said, that no additional reports along the lines of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5505 were really necessary,
                            except a list of concrete courses of action which the U.S. could follow
                            in these various areas.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he shared much of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s view, which agreed with his
                            that some one person must constantly follow and be responsible for the
                            actions designed to carry out the strategy set down in the present
                            report. The President then added that it was his view that paragraph 4–c
                            should not be deleted. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> repeated the view that he couldn’t see that
                            inclusion or deletion of the paragraph made any significant difference.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> complained that
                            the last sentence of paragraph 4–c seemed to him a little overconfident
                            in tone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed
                            with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, and said
                            he was particularly inclined to question the accuracy of the view that
                            the Soviets would not initiate general war or actions risking general
                            war, in view of the Chinese Communist reaction toward the President’s
                            statement to the Congress respecting U.S. policy in the Formosa
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believed that the Soviets were undoubtedly doing
                            all they could to involve the United States in Asia and in a general war
                            with Communist China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> added that this was why he was so inclined to
                            doubt the validity of the last sentence in paragraph 4–c</p>
                        <p>With considerable emphasis, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> said he wished to point out to the Council that
                            he had been involved for many months in all the major studies and plans
                            which had been formulated by the Joint Chief s of Staff, Never, however,
                            in all this long time, had the Joint Chiefs of Staff planned a U.S. land
                            offensive on the <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0038"/>mainland of
                            Communist China. For the life of him, he could not understand why, in
                            the event of a general war between the United States and Communist
                            China, all the worst difficulties would not be on the Chinese rather
                            than on the U.S. side. The great problem of the Chinese in such a war
                            was to “get at us if we don’t choose to be got at.” The only direction
                            in which the Chinese Communists could mount an aggressive offensive on
                            land would be toward the south or in Korea. Accordingly, the general
                            theory that a war with Communist China would involve the United States
                            militarily to very great depths was simply incomprehensible to him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this
                            was all very well, but would Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> explain to him how, if we got into a war with
                            Communist China, you would end it. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that he failed to see how the Russians
                            could be anything else but losers if the United States got into a
                            general war with Communist China. The Chinese Communists would have very
                            little offensive capability against us which we could not counter with
                            the exercise of comparatively little military power. It would,
                            accordingly, be a mistake, really, for the Russians to try to involve
                            the U.S. in war with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s
                            view as to such a mistake by the Russians, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the Admiral’s analysis
                            did not take account adequately of the political advantages which the
                            Soviets might well gain in Europe if we should get into a war with
                            Communist China. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>
                            quickly admitted that he was speaking from a military point of view and
                            had not taken these other factors into account. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to enlarge on the very
                            great difficulties that Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony
                                Eden</persName> was facing in the British Parliament in his efforts
                            to back up the new U.S. policy regarding the offshore islands, in the
                            face of the combined opposition of Messrs. Attlee and Bevan. This
                            showed, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            that the big danger resulting from a war between the U.S. and Communist
                            China was not to be found in the realm of military action, where he
                            agreed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s
                            analysis. The great danger of such a war was the possibility that it
                            would alienate the allies of the United States and might indeed block
                            all our best-laid plans for Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to say
                            that his own analysis of the situation induced him to believe that
                            Russia and China were bluffing, and that we would succeed in calling
                            their bluff if we proceeded along the lines of the recent decision
                            respecting the defense of Formosa and certain of the offshore islands.
                            The Russians are perfectly well aware that operations of the kind that
                            could occur in carrying out this new policy might give rise to a
                            situation in which the Russians themselves could become involved in a
                            general war. <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>Since he believed that
                            the Russians did not wish to become so involved, he believed that they
                            were bluffing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he, on
                            the other hand, was inclined to look at the situation much as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did. While he approved
                            the recent move by the President regarding Formosa and the offshore
                            islands, we might presently find out in fact whether the Soviets and
                            Chinese were really bluffing. On the other side of the picture,
                            continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, if he
                            had the job of killing a rattlesnake he would try to cut off his head
                            rather than his rattles. There was another aspect of this cold war
                            situation, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            that also continually bothered him. He believed that in many of the
                            underdeveloped areas of the world the ordinary run of people were likely
                            to make more progress under a Communist regime than under the
                            traditional types of dictatorships. This was a troublesome fact, but he
                            nevertheless believed that the common people of China were getting along
                            just as well under the present regime as ever they had under the war
                            lords of the old days.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the exchange between Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, the President said he himself doubted whether
                            the Russians would permit themselves at this time to become involved in
                            a general war. He also doubted if any such general war could be ended in
                            a week or ten days. Perhaps the Russians felt the same way as he did.
                            Nevertheless, if they continued apparently to egg on the Chinese
                            Communists, there must be some good reason for it.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that his
                            explanation as to why the Soviets were apparently egging on the Chinese
                            Communists was as follows: The Soviets may fear that if the Chinese
                            Communists permit themselves to be involved in friendlier relations with
                            the Western world, the Soviets may not be able to control the Chinese so
                            effectively. If this were so, the most desirable course of action for
                            the United States was to try to separate the Chinese and the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> observed that
                            while it was true that the Russians had had ups and downs in their
                            policy toward Europe since 1945, they had made steady progress since
                            that year in their program to subjugate the Far East. The only way to
                            put an end to this steady progress and to secure peace and stability in
                            Asia, was to carry out faithfully the policy which the President had
                            announced to the Congress last week.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed great
                            skepticism as to the likelihood that the Chinese Communists would make
                            serious attacks on Formosa or on the offshore islands which the United
                            States would assist in defending. If this proved to be the case, and
                            after a certain amount of noise the Chinese Communists subsided and took
                            to peaceful ways, this was the moment for the United States to try to
                            broaden our trade with Communist China and to explore other
                            possibilities of opening <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0040"/>up
                            contact with them designed to wean them away from their alliance with
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President, speaking of paragraph 4–c which had given rise to
                            this discussion, said that perhaps the concern of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff with this paragraph was that it was too confident in its
                            assumption that the Communist rulers would act like normal people.
                            Communists simply do not react normally. Accordingly, said the Vice
                            President, he was skeptical of the possibility of inducing evolutionary
                            change in the Soviet Union or in the satellites if we believed that the
                            strategy set forth in the present report would ever change the minds and
                            the hearts of the Communist rulers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> suggested that paragraph
                            4–c be deleted as not being necessary to the sense of the paper as a
                            whole.</p>

                                <item>Within the free world today exists a considerable emigration
                                    of former Soviet or Russian citizens, numbering over 1 million,
                                    widely dispersed individuals, varying greatly in age and
                                    experience. These émigrés represent wide divergences in
                                    political, social and national backgrounds. The overwhelming
                                    majority, although to varying degrees interested in Russian
                                    problems, are not politically active and are more concerned with
                                    the difficult problems they face in adjusting themselves to the
                                    foreign environment of exile. A minority, sometimes referred to
                                    as “the political emigration”, is passionately interested and
                                    dedicated to the general proposition of the overthrow of the
                                    Bolshevik regime.</item>

                                <item>The existence of a large Russian emigration living abroad in
                                    exile is not a new phenomenon. In particular, the 19th century
                                    witnessed a large and fluid emigration centered particularly in
                                    western Europe, whose members were either forced or voluntary
                                    exiles from Czarist Russia. Scattered among the larger cities of
                                    Europe, and even to a certain extent in the United States, these
                                    émigrés pursued their mission of overthrowing czarist autocracy
                                    in the atmosphere of idealism and intrigue, theoretical
                                    speculation and frustration, violent activity and apathetic
                                    despair which is characteristic of the environment of exile. But
                                    from this 19th century emigration sprang many of the divergent
                                    political parties, ideals and leaders, which played important
                                    and often tragic roles in the 20th century revolutions and civil
                                    war which eventually ended with Bolshevik seizure of power
                                    throughout Russia.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The present emigration resembles in many ways its 19th century
                                    predecessor as well as other Russian emigrations even further
                                    removed in history. Generally, however, it dates its existence
                                    from the Bolshevik revolution and the subsequent civil war. As a
                                    result, within its ranks it has collected a great variety of
                                    conflicting <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0043"/>political
                                    tendencies ranging from a few remaining older monarchists to
                                    survivors of the various Russian “<persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                                        >White</persName>” armies, Social-Democratic and
                                    Social-Revolutionary exiles who opposed both former groupings,
                                    down through subsequent political movements newly formed and
                                    reformed in exile without ever having had a root in the
                                    political life of Russia. The emigration itself, since 1917, has
                                    been periodically injected with new blood through the continuous
                                    addition of exiles who have fled ever since the establishment of
                                    the Soviet regime. In the latter category, the most important
                                    recent addition is a very large group of refugees representing
                                    former German-held Soviet prisoners and forced labor who did not
                                    wish to return to Russia following the war, together with former
                                    members of the Russian Vlasov army which fought on the German
                                    side in the final stages of World War II.</item>

                                <item>For purposes of this paper the Soviet emigration is understood
                                    to be limited to persons coming from the area included within
                                    the 1939 boundaries of the Soviet Union. Specifically, this
                                    definition excludes émigrés from the Baltic States (Estonia,
                                    Latvia and Lithuania), which are in a separate category by
                                    virtue of the fact that the United States Government has never
                                    recognized their incorporation into the Soviet Union and
                                    continues to receive their diplomatic representatives. Relations
                                    with the Baltic emigrations therefore come within the purview of
                                    the Free Europe Committee, not the American Committee for
                                    Liberation from Bolshevism.</item>

                                <item>The political history of the emigration since 1917 has not
                                    been a happy one. In the aggregate it has been characterized by
                                    failure. Cut off from the actual experience of Soviet life,
                                    deprived of adequate means of communication or the material
                                    ability to affect Russian life, the various attempts of
                                    different disunited émigré groupings to bring about either by
                                    revolution or other means the overthrow of the Soviet
                                    government, or accurately to predict the course of events within
                                    the Soviet Union, have met with failure. If the small
                                    politically active parties and organizations of the émigrés
                                    could themselves unite, or if they could succeed in uniting the
                                    mass of the emigration itself behind them, it is obvious that
                                    their influence and usefulness in the free world struggle with
                                    Soviet communism would be enhanced. The emigration’s capability
                                    to achieve its final objectives—liberation in various
                                    forms—would not be significantly changed, however. The future of
                                    the peoples of the Soviet Union and of the Soviet regime itself,
                                    depends on factors and forces outside the control of the
                                    emigration. This fact is realized by most of the emigration, and
                                    they in turn envisage liberation as usually coming about as the
                                    result of a war between the Soviet Union and the West. Some
                                    would frankly wish to hasten this event; all wish to position

                                    political objectives in the event of such a conflict. As a
                                    result, the emigration represents in a real sense a present-day
                                    cold war ally of some value, but many deficiencies, and a
                                    potential ally in the event of war of greater, but equally
                                    indeterminate, value.</item>

                                <item>At the present time no particular unity or cohesion
                                    characterizes either the mass of the emigration or the small and
                                    fragmentary politically active groups which try to speak in its
                                    name. Although such cohesion and unity is desirable, and
                                    periodic attempts are made in this direction, it is improbable
                                    that much success will be achieved in the foreseeable future in
                                    this respect. It would appear that not only are the real
                                    divisions of ideology and interest too great among the émigrés
                                    but that the very environment of exile in itself renders such
                                    unity impossible, to judge from past history.</item>

                                <item>Within the present emigration are apparent two generally
                                    opposed broad groupings: one composed of political parties which
                                    claim to speak in the name of the non-Russian nationalities, the
                                    other composed of organizations purporting to speak for the
                                    Russian nationality, although at the same time frequently
                                    claiming to reflect the views of the peoples of the Soviet Union
                                    as a whole. Each of these two divisions is itself divided and
                                    fragmented into smaller groups representing divergent and
                                    conflicting political traditions and beliefs, ranging from
                                    extreme rightist concepts to Social-Democratic and other leftist
                                    philosophies. The overriding issue, however, which divides the
                                    emigration into these two fairly distinct camps is the question
                                    concerning the manner in which the nationality problem will be
                                    solved within the borders of the present Soviet Union, following
                                    liberation. Although both Russian and nationality groups adhere
                                    to various principles and formulas of self-determination for all
                                    the peoples of the Soviet Union they are in fact sorely divided
                                    on this question and may be expected to remain so for the
                                    foreseeable future. In essence, the non-Russian nationalities’
                                    representatives favor, and desire U.S. support for, the
                                    independent existence as national states of the various national
                                    groups within the USSR, although occasionally envisaging some
                                    type of loose federation. There is a significant number of
                                    non-Russians, however, who do not identify themselves with such
                                    “separatist” ambitions. In general, political groups
                                    representing Russian, as distinguished from other nationalities,
                                    question both the desirability of, and the will for, separate
                                    national existences on the part of the non-Russians within the
                                    Soviet Union, although envisaging some form of autonomy as
                                    probably necessary and desirable for the nationalities.</item>

                                <item>Most elements within each of the two broad groupings are eager
                                    and anxious to aid in liberation whether by means of propaganda
                                    directed toward the peoples of the Soviet Union or other more
                                    activist means. They are equally anxious to gain official U.S.
                                    support, material and moral, for their particular solution to
                                    the problem of the future organization and government of the
                                    Soviet Union. To further their ends, they have frequently
                                    attempted to inject their views into domestic United States
                                    politics, with some success, both in the sense of urging greater
                                    efforts on the part of the U.S. Government to support émigré
                                    undertakings for revolution in general, and to support one or
                                    the other side of the two opposing camps—Russians and
                                    Nationalities in particular. To oversimplify, the nationality
                                    émigrés would desire U.S. support now for the concept of
                                    independent, separate national states for the Nationalities,
                                    including diplomatic recognition for their governments in exile
                                    along with practical measures in propaganda and other means to
                                    further this objective. The Russian émigrés warn, on the other
                                    hand, that the United States would thus incur the enmity of the
                                    Russian people and solidify support for the Soviet regime either
                                    in time of peace or war, thus strengthening rather than
                                    weakening Soviet communism.</item>

                                    freedom and self-determination for all peoples to establish

                                    peaceful and stable manner. These fundamental political ideas
                                    are the expression of the American belief that the security and
                                    welfare of individuals, as well as states within an
                                    international society, are best preserved by such systems of
                                    government. In a limited sense, therefore, the United States

                                <item>It is widely held within the emigration that the Soviet regime
                                    carries within it the seeds of its own decay and destruction.
                                    Tensions, strains and vulnerabilities may lead, particularly if

                                    radical change by other means, of the Soviet regime. It is
                                    important to realize that while the emigration furnishes both a

                                    and experimentation which has thus far been undertaken by the
                                    United States Government in this direction does not as yet
                                    indicate enough evidence to support the overly optimistic hopes
                                    and ambitions of the émigrés in this respect. Some of the
                                    beliefs and assertions of the nationality émigrés regarding
                                    support for independent States among nationality minorities
                                    within the Soviet Union are a case in point. The best evidence
                                    to date indicates that there are in fact considerable minority
                                    discontents within the Soviet Union. Some, perhaps a majority,
                                    of these discontents are no different in kind or quality than
                                    the general dissatisfactions felt by Russians as well concerning
                                    life under the Soviet regime. Of a different nature are
                                    discontents among the nationalities directed against the
                                    Russians. These feelings are complex and not subject to finite
                                    evaluation. Careful study indicates, however, that such
                                    sentiments do not find a significant expression in a desire for
                                    independent national existences. Often the desire is simply for
                                    better relations of equality with the Russians. Thus, those real
                                    discontents within the minorities of the Soviet Union, which the
                                    U.S. should indeed exploit, differ greatly in motivation and
                                    content from the discontents which nationality émigrés out of
                                    contact with their homeland are apt to attribute to groups
                                    living under the Soviet regime. This does not mean that the
                                    United States must either neglect the continuous investigation,
                                    or positive experimentation with appropriate courses of action
                                    in this direction, but suggests rather the caution with which
                                    such activities must be pursued until better evidence is
                                    available on which to base U.S. supported activities.</item>

                                <item>During the next five years it is unlikely that short of war
                                    the stability or effective authority of the Soviet regime can be
                                    either overthrown or seriously threatened by the action of
                                    forces outside the leadership or by a struggle for power within
                                    the ruling hierarchy. The regime will probably be able to
                                    maintain the largely invulnerable omnipotence of the State with
                                    the concomitant ability to control public opinion and render
                                    popular discontent impotent. Accordingly, cold war operations of
                                    the type which may be promoted by the U.S. and undertaken by
                                    émigrés, aimed to create disaffection or opposition within
                                    either the broad strata of the Soviet population or specific
                                    groups, cannot be expected to influence these characteristics to
                                    the point of stimulating major change. Such activities, the most
                                    important of which are sponsored by the American Committee for
                                    Liberation from Bolshevism, are, however, of major importance.
                                    Although evaluation of their effectiveness is difficult, they
                                    already appear to have achieved results of significance. In the
                                    long term, the ideas and information thus transmitted to the
                                    peoples of the Soviet Union aids in preconditioning them to
                                    alternative forms of political and social life more in their own
                                    interest, and in <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0047"/>ours.
                                    Stated another way, the objective of such anti-Soviet political
                                    activities is to create support for alternative forms of Soviet
                                    governmental structure and behavior which would both better
                                    satisfy the natural aspirations of the Soviet peoples as well as
                                    the interests of U.S. and free world security. In the short
                                    term, such activities may have significant results in fostering
                                    defection and in creating doubt in the minds of Soviet leaders

                                    and exploitation is that gradual change in Soviet behavior and
                                    belief which may be brought about more by the growing strength
                                    and cohesion of the free world and its ability successfully to
                                    resist and deter Soviet aggression than by any other means. Some
                                    anti-Soviet activities, either by émigrés, or supported…by the

                                    help such a process, although it must be noted that the

                                    Union on a broad scale might have the opposite effect and be a
                                    contributing factor to an increase in Soviet intransigeance and

                                <item>It is not desirable that the United States, in an official and
                                    overt manner, formulate at the present time its objectives
                                    towards the future of either a “liberated” or defeated Russia.
                                    It is neither in our interest, due to our objective of bringing
                                    about a change in Soviet behavior favorable to U.S. and free
                                    world security, nor within our capabilities, due to the
                                    inconclusive nature of present evidence concerning basic
                                    political factors within the Soviet Union. The nationalities
                                    problem is again a case in point. In the event of general war, a
                                    rapid and successful conclusion of hostilities might, under
                                    certain circumstances, be furthered by U.S. promises of support
                                    of independence for the nationalities. On the other hand, it is
                                    certain that such a U.S. position would influence unfavorably
                                    important groups both within and without the Soviet leadership
                                    who otherwise might take actions in the U.S. interest.

                            State Department had called him despite the fact that the story had been
                            out for several hours.</p>
                        <p>(<persName>Dulles</persName> later raised all sort of hell in his

                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> told me that while he had not anticipated
                            these exact changes (it was later announced that <persName

                            that some big changes were coming up in Russia about a week ago. He said
                            that, of course, this was indicative of dissatisfaction within Russia
                            and recommended that we have no official statement on it at this time. I
                            passed this on to the President with Andy Goodpaster, and the President
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>The stories came thick and fast out of Russia after the <persName

                        <p>Throughout the day the President was informed of these reports by

                                <item>That the Russian hierarchy has been having considerable
                                    trouble prior to STALIN’s death. As STALIN was becoming weaker
                                    in health, the in-fighting and double dealing for power had
                                    started. Actually, when <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                        >Malenkov</persName> was named as his successor, it was in
                                    effect a compromise and the fighting still continued. This was,
                                    of course, evident when Beria was done away with and is more
                                    evident now with <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>
                                    in this post. The President also told me that this was just
                                    another reason why he had been resisting the British plea for a
                                    four-power conference. “It took an awful long time to get the
                                    British to realize that with the trouble going on inside of
                                    Russia, it would not be to the advantage of the free world for
                                    Churchill and myself and whoever the French man would be to sit
                                    down publicly with any given leader of Russia. If we did that,
                                    it would serve notice, not only throughout the world but also
                                    within Russia that we were recognizing <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> or <persName

                                    might <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0054"/>be as the leader.
                                    That would give him a great advantage within Russia and would
                                    tend to minimize the struggles for power that are going on
                                    within Russia. We certainly don’t want to do that arid that’s
                                    why I have never wanted to meet with the Russian leader—at least
                                    for the time being.”</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>I asked the President if he thought that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s appointment would
                                    mean that Russia was moving toward war. He said that he did not
                                    think so; that as a matter of fact, if the Army had more
                                    influence in Russia, it would probably be a conservative
                                    influence. “You know, if you’re in the military and you know
                                    about these terrible destructive weapons, it tends to make you
                                    more pacifistic than you normally have been. In most countries
                                    the influence of the military is more conservative, and so while
                                    I do not know for sure, I would not be surprised if the Army
                                    influence would be just that within the Soviet Union. They’re
                                    not ready for war and they know it. They also know if they go to
                                    war, they’re going to end up losing everything they have. That
                                    also tends to make people conservative.”</item>

                            really rattled the sword, saying that Russia was way ahead of the United

                            also said if Russia were attacked, it would destroy western

                                >H</gloss>-bomb charge and he told me that we have no evidence at

                            their country. Strauss said that he was sure this was merely a
                            propaganda speech by the Russians. I told him to send me a memo to this

                            year now there had been signs that <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> was losing power. However, the actual secret of
                            his “resignation” had been very carefully kept. There had been good
                            reason to believe that the summoning of the Supreme Soviet a month ahead
                            of time would <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0056"/>have dramatic
                            repercussions, the more so since this coincided with the summoning back
                            to Moscow of a significant number of Soviet Ambassadors abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then said that he did not believe that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>’s fall from power
                            was to be ascribed to any of the assertions of guilt made in his
                            statement. For one thing, he had been less responsible for the failures
                            in Soviet agriculture than <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> himself, and he had had certainly as wide
                            administrative experience as <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>. The real point seemed to be that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> had lost the second round of a
                            great power struggle. Accordingly, this may be the beginning of the end
                            of the period of collective leadership in the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then gave a brief comparison of the
                            decline and fall of Beria<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Beria’s arrest was
                                announced on July 10, 1953.</note> and <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>, noting that a possible reason for the fact
                            that thus far <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> had
                            escaped Beria’s fate was that Beria had actually been caught in a plot
                            to seize power.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, continued Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, was now clearly in the dominant
                            position in the Soviet hierarchy. Moreover, the influence of the
                            military was now at an all-time high in the Soviet Union— this despite
                            the fact that Marshal <persName>Bulganin</persName> was in truth an “old
                            Bolshevik” rather than a genuine military man. He had had no battle
                            experience, and was usually known as “General Rabbit” by the real
                            soldiers in the Soviet Army. According to the statements of a high-level
                            defector, the Soviet Army now gained for itself the power and prestige
                            in the Soviet Government which had once been held by the <gloss
                                target="#t_MVD1">MVD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In the view of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, said Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, the committee form of government cannot
                            endure in the USSR. He predicted that the struggle for supreme power
                            would continue, with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            playing the cagy STALIN game of slowly consolidating his power against
                            his rivals. He had deliberately refused the first job (of Prime
                            Minister) in order to consolidate his rivals against himself.</p>
                        <p>The difficult question was how and why this crisis had come to a head at
                            this particular time. Obviously the economic issues had played an
                            important part, with <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>
                            cast in the role of goat. Foreign policy had also played a considerable
                            part. There was a widespread feeling that <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>’s so-called “soft” line had not been notably
                            successful, especially in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to comment that this judgment showed how
                            different the picture looked to the Russians than to ourselves, who had
                            been so greatly concerned about the apparent success of the Soviets with
                            the soft line of foreign policy.</p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0057"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to point out that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> does not seem to have shared
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>’s views on the line
                            to be followed in foreign policy. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> preferred the tougher line, and we could
                            certainly expect tougher words on that subject from now on out. It was
                            too early to say whether the actual foreign policy would change along
                            with the words, but very possibly it would not.</p>
                        <p>Neither economic nor foreign policy, continued Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, sufficiently explains what had happened
                            in Moscow. It was “a truly Russian affair”, with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> obliged to sit and listen
                            while his statement of shortcomings was read before all. It was quite
                            likely that <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> would
                            gradually disappear from view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> described the appointment of <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> was named
                                Minister of Defense on February 9.</note> as “very interesting”. The
                            defectors to whom he had referred earlier had insisted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> was much too popular in the
                            Soviet Union ever to be appointed to the Ministry of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to say that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> was, despite everything, “a likable cuss”, and
                            had on more than one occasion manifested to the President a certain
                            independence of his political associates. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said this might prove to be a matter of
                            the carrot-and-the-stick policy, <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> being the carrot and <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> the stick. The President agreed, but pointed
                            out that the increase in Army influence symbolized by the elevation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> did not necessarily
                            portend a tougher and more dangerous Soviet policy. The Army, said the
                            President, tended to be a conservative force.</p>

                            from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers on February 8 cleared
                            the way for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Nikita</persName> S. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to assume the position of
                            number one authority in the Soviet Union. The course of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s career has now brought him
                            to the stage where, operating from STALIN’s old vantage point as Party
                            First Secretary, he has outdistanced all his colleagues in the
                            accumulation of power.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was born in 1894, the
                            son of a miner. He received little or no education, worked for a period
                            in the coal fields, and joined the Party only in 1918, after the
                            Revolution. The Party educated him and advanced him through the ranks to
                            the important post of Moscow secretary in the mid-1930’s. STALIN
                            accepted him in the Politburo in 1938, and sent him to the Ukraine as
                            Moscow’s viceroy. During the first part of the war he was at Stalingrad
                            and Voronezh. Returning to Kiev in 1943, he ruled the Ukraine with an
                            iron hand for the next four years. Then, following an apparent set back,
                            he returned to Moscow in 1949 to become the spokesman for the
                            government’s kolkhoz amalgamation and resettlement program. After
                            peasant resistance developed to some features of this, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was publicly rebuked in
                            early 1951 and transferred to other Party work.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after STALIN’s death in March 1953, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> occupied a position publicly
                            subordinate to the top three leaders— <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>, Beriya, and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>. He played his hand well, however, and quickly
                            replaced <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> as
                            first-ranking Party secretary. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s discernible rise began after the fall of
                            Beriya in June 1953. He assumed direction of the government’s new farm
                            program and began to tinker with foreign affairs. During 1954 his
                            activities and publicity in domestic and foreign fields overshadowed
                            those of his Kremlin colleagues. He paid visits to the three most
                            important countries in the Soviet orbit—Communist China, Czechoslovakia,
                                <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0059"/>and Poland. Although lacking
                            an important bureaucratic position, he acted as though he occupied one
                            and participated increasingly in governmental affairs.</p>
                        <p>In his political views, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            has been careful to reflect doctrinaire positions. This is particularly
                            true of his statements of foreign affairs. Toward the West he is
                            outspoken in his hostility, and repeats the dialectical stereotypes with
                            seeming conviction. In internal affairs he follows closely the standard
                            Party line with its traditional emphases.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s personality is
                            forceful, dogmatic, and blunt. He is essentially a simple type with few
                            inhibitions and little sophistication. He seems to owe his present
                            position to a combination of dogged perseverance, ruthlessness, and
                            native shrewdness. Unlike most Bolsheviks he is reputed to have a sense
                            of humor. On occasions, especially when he has had too much to drink, he
                            has been heard making indiscreet statements. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is married, has a large family and, contrary

                            place during the briefing by the Director of Central Intelligence on
                            significant world developments affecting United States national

                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then turned to the internal
                                    situation in the Soviet Union. There had been so many changes in
                                    the government in recent days that it was proving very difficult
                                    to appraise the significance of the changes beyond stating that
                                    they indicated a picture of dissatisfaction with the status quo,
                                    especially in the realm of agriculture. When Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> was not among those who
                                    had recently been promoted, Secretary <persName

                                    thought this significant, and the President said with a smile
                                    that perhaps the failure to promote <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                        >Zhukov</persName> was the result of our saying too many
                                    nice things about him here in the United States.</p>

                                    this might be the precursor of a Soviet effort to create in
                                    Eastern Europe military defense arrangements similar to those of

                        </list>
                        <p>Soviet military leaders undoubtedly have gained in prestige since
                            STALIN’s death. There is no indication, however, that the power position
                            of the Military within the ruling group has been notably strengthened or
                            that the Soviet armed forces are playing a more independent role than in
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>In allowing the military increased public prominence, the present regime
                            was probably motivated by a desire to take advantage of the popularity
                            of the armed forces among the population. Thus, there occurred such
                            developments as the assignment of a leading role to army generals in the
                            Beriya trial; the appointment of Marshal <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>, the USSR’s leading war hero, as Minister of
                            Defense; <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s interview with
                            the Hearst delegation and his letter to <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31"
                                facs="0061"/>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>; and the recent promotion of ten generals to
                            the rank of marshal.</p>
                        <p>These actions have not impinged on the supremacy of the Party. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>, for example, is a member of the
                            Party Central Committee and is not the first military careerist to serve
                            as Minister of Defense. His lack of top-level influence is clearly
                            implied in the failure to include him among the new deputies to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>. Certain of the
                            actions, such as the recent promotions, may indicate the growing concern
                            of the regime with problems of national defense. Nevertheless, there is
                            no professional military leader in either the Presidium of the Party or
                            the Presidium of the Council of Ministers. The Party safeguards itself
                            against possible rivals through the maintenance of units in all
                            institutions. Recently there have been indications that such units
                            within lower military echelons have been strengthened, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> stated in February that 77
                            percent of all Soviet soldiers are either Party or Komsomol members.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances there appears to be little likelihood that the
                            army can supplant the Party as the center of power; nor is there reason
                            to believe that the Party has been impelled to enter into a concordat
                            with the military in order to continue the dictatorship. It is probable,
                            however, that relations between the army and the Party are somewhat more
                            amicable than under STALIN.</p>

                            never officially been liquidated but it has been pretty dormant for 3–4
                            years. It puts out a periodical from he believes <pb n="32"

                            function, but there have been no meetings for its members. The Sec.
                            asked what is it that runs the Communist Parties all over the world. The
                            mechanism, said A., by which direction gets out is varied—sometimes the
                            line is given by Pravda or Izvestia—sometimes in the journal or by
                            courier and word of mouth. A. said the question of whether the Soviets
                            might now close it out is one they have been speculating on as a gesture
                            they could make without any cost to themselves. The Sec. asked what can
                            they do with cost in relation to International Communism. A. said not
                            very much because they maintain connections clandestinely. The Sec.
                            asked re our never getting proof from Guatemala of any contact. A. said
                            nothing conclusive. The Cominform was not used as a channel of guidance
                            though it may have been partially. A. said he could bring someone up to
                            talk about it, but the Sec. said he hadn’t the time now. The Sec. said
                            we have to put our heads together with <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

                        <p>The Quantico Panel Report was submitted to <persName corresp="#p_RNA1"
                                >Rockefeller</persName> under cover of a memorandum of June 10,
                            1955, from Rostow. The report consisted of five chapters and four
                            appendices, plus ten papers prepared by individual panel members. In his
                            covering memorandum, Rostow wrote that the one impression that stood out
                            in his mind was “the unanimous belief of the Panel members that the U.S.
                            now enjoys a significant but transitory period of over-all strength
                            vis-à-vis the Soviet bloc” He noted further that the “next two or three
                            years afford the United States the opportunity to negotiate from a
                            strong position for genuine concessions by the enemy without sacrifice
                            of essential positions of strength” and that this kind of negotiation,
                            “along with a vigorous and urgent development of potential Free World
                            strength, could create the conditions for victory in the cold war.”
                            Rostow’s covering memorandum and a summary of the recommendations by the

                                    country, it would seem that perhaps the best time for such a
                                    visit would be during November or December of this year for the
                                    following reasons: <list>
                                        <item>“a. Because if the Soviet leaders were here while
                                            Congress was in session, the question of appearing
                                            before a joint session of Congress might arise, and this

                            the United States” and that it would be better to wait until after the

                            use of plastic balloons as carriers of photographic and electronic
                            reconnaissance equipment since 1948, by 1953 the Air Force was
                            experimenting and testing the balloons for such purposes. By the middle
                            of 1954, the Air Force had launched over 500 reconnaissance balloons in
                            test project “Moby Dick” and had, by the fall of that year, drawn up a
                            basic operational concept for all future important reconnaissance
                            programs. On March 23, 1955, Air Force headquarters assigned the
                            Strategic Air Command to undertake a pioneer reconnaissance of Soviet
                            territory. (Memorandum of a conversation by <persName>Robert F.

                            Operation—Project Genetrix. For principal officer only. The United
                            States Air Force has made plans for a balloon reconnaissance operation
                            to be conducted during the period 1 December 1955 and 1 May 1956. The
                            code name for this project is Genetrix and is classified Confidential.
                            The plan provides for the launching of approximately 2700 plastic,
                            gondola-carrying balloons …Of the 2700 balloons launched, 2500 will be
                            photographic systems and 200 will be electronic intercept systems.
                            Subsequent to launching, it is expected that the ballons will drift for
                                <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>several days at various
                            altitudes between 40,000 ft. and 80,000 ft. eastward over
                            Communist-controlled territory. The greatest concentration of balloons
                            will probably emerge from the Communist-controlled eastern coast of Asia
                            into a planned recovery area in the Western Pacific between 10 degrees
                            and 70 degrees north latitude. Elements of the First Air Division,
                            Strategic Air Command, will be responsible for recovery of balloons in
                            the planned recovery area.</p>
                        <p>Based on the best available information at this time, some of the
                            reconnaissance balloons may be expected to land outside of the planned
                            recovery area in some cases, and possibly in the area of your
                            responsibility. It is requested that you render all possible and
                            appropriate assistance to Air Force representatives in your area in
                            connection with this project.</p>
                        <p>The United States Air Force will forward to all major air commands and
                            air attachés concerned all details regarding Project Genetrix. Air
                            attachés will have primary action responsibility in the recovery of the
                            reconnaissance gondolas. Attachés or Air Force representatives will be
                            instructed to brief thoroughly Chiefs of Mission and Principal Officers
                            on pertinent details of the project to include the project’s cover story
                            which may be used when authorized to inform local government officials
                            or members of the press.</p>
                        <p>The Department is now considering, with the Air Force, whether and in
                            what form press releases should be made in Washington either when the
                            project is initiated or when information concerning it is picked up here
                            or abroad. Press releases or answers to questions in the field should be
                            carefully coordinated with action in Washington. Accordingly, no action
                            to publicize or to inform local officials should be taken by addressees
                            or Air Force representatives prior to further communication from
                            Department.</p>

                                three different hypotheses and marshalls the arguments behind each
                                without making a selection.” Attached to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                    >CIA</gloss> paper was a note dated December 30 from Amory to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName>, in which Amory said
                                he was “sticking with the third hypothesis for the time

                        <p>Most recent evidence supports the view that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> is the dominant figure in the Soviet
                            hierarchy. He has become the most important spokesman of the Soviet
                            regime on both domestic and foreign questions. It is likely that the
                            hand of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is behind a
                            number of the shifts of local Party officials which have occurred since
                            the July announcement of the forthcoming Party Congress, but not all
                            officials affected can be directly linked to him. It is possible that
                            these local changes are designed to achieve two related objectives: (1)
                            they may serve to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s influence throughout the system of
                            territorial Party organs and effect a “packing” of delegations to the
                            congress with his adherents, and (2) the shifts also raise a number of
                            Party officials to positions where they would be logical nominees for
                            membership in the Central Committee or other bodies to be elected at the
                            congress. The rise of Khrushchevism influence does not mean, however,
                            that “collective leadership” has lost all significance. “Collective
                            leadership” never involved, and of course does not now involve, the
                            equal sharing of power at the top level. Appreciation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s superior position should
                            not lead, therefore, to the conclusion that he has secured, or is about
                            to secure, a STALIN-type prominence.</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> paper <hi rend="italic"
                                >Speculations on the Soviet Leadership Situation</hi> presents
                            arguments for a series of three hypotheses. The first, the approaching
                            impregnability of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, is
                            the most convincing of the three, but appears, nevertheless, to be
                            overdrawn. The other two, positing a coalescence of anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> forces or arguing for a
                            continued effectiveness of collective leadership, are weakly supported;
                            in the case of the latter, over-weakly.</p>
                        <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0069"/>
                        <p>2. The conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s position “will become practically impregnable”
                            after the 20th Party Congress (February 1956) is supported by some
                            dubious arguments. Leadership changes are not as uniformly indicative of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s sway as the
                            paper implies. The authors seem to have overlooked the appointment to
                            the Party’s Presidium last July of Suslov, whose ties to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> are very tenuous. Likewise,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s influence is not
                            too evident in the appointment in 1955 of new deputy chairmen of the
                            Council of Ministers/Two of the new deputy chairmen cannot be directly
                            linked with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, nor can
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, Pervukhin, and
                            Saburov, who were elevated to First Deputy Chairmen. Even some of the
                            recently-appointed Secretaries of the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1"
                                >CPSU</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            immediate lieutenants, cannot be classified in any definite way as
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> protégés. The fact
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> still holds a
                            position in the government and that there was a long delay in the
                            appointment of Matskevich as Minister of Agriculture could also be
                            interpreted as indicating resistance to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s influence.</p>
                        <p>Much of the argumentation on this topic is based on very capricious
                            speculation. Thus, the authors describe Yegorov and Konstantinov as
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> men, although the
                            evidence for the proposition is most inconclusive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> is hastily dismissed as a
                            deviationist. The formulation used by <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> for which he was forced to admit his error was
                            an incidental reference buried in a full dress foreign affairs
                                speech.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">The party journal <hi
                                    rend="italic">Kommunist</hi> on October 8, 1955, published a
                                letter of September 16 from <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                    >Molotov</persName>, in which he recanted comments he had made
                                in his February 8, 1955, report to the Supreme Soviet about the
                                foundations of a socialist society having already been built in the
                                Soviet Union.</note> If it was considered at all serious
                            ideologically it seems that some attempt would have been made before
                            October to correct it, yet the speech was still being published in
                            pamphlet form in minority languages as late as September. The main
                            reasons for the rebuff to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            seems to be suggested by the timing of the letter just prior to the
                            Geneva Foreign Minister’s Conference. It appears that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> wished to emphasize their
                            final authority in the field of foreign policy. Soviet comment at the
                            time suggested that the censure was also related to the rapprochement
                            with Yugoslavia, which <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            reportedly opposed.</p>
                        <p>3. Reasoning and evidence buttressing the second and third hypotheses are
                            extremely weak. The proposition on anti-<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> moves is introduced by three most doubtful
                            points: the so-called <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>
                            promotion to First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the
                            so-called <hi rend="italic">Pravda-Izvestiya</hi> conflict over the corn
                            program, and the appointment of a “<persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> man,” i.e. Konstantinov, <pb n="40"
                                xml:id="pg_40" facs="0070"/>as agit-prop chief. The paper refers to
                            five possibly dissatisfied groups in the population. There is very
                            little evidence of this dissatisfaction, and in some cases even of the
                            group’s existence. The argument for dissatisfaction within the army
                            element seems to oppose the argument given earlier suggesting that the
                            army will be faithful to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The arguments presented to support the collective leadership hypothesis,
                            the third, do not stand up very well and in some cases might be used to
                            prove the opposite point. What is called “the best ammunition” is
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s willingness to travel abroad
                            for five weeks. Their willingness to travel abroad so long could also be
                            interpreted as reflecting <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s complete confidence in the security of his
                            position. The contention that <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"

                        <p>4. The authors show a certain naivete and amateurishness in their
                            handling of evidence on the leadership question. This is exemplified in
                            the reference to <persName corresp="#p_KL1">Kaganovich</persName>
                            speaking “as one fully in accord with current policies” at the October
                            anniversary celebration, to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName> acting “as if he fully approves the current
                            state of affairs,” to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> as
                            “content to play a supporting role,” and to <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> as “prominently associated with policies of the
                            regime.” These postures and declarations are perfectly standard and
                            prove nothing about leadership struggles or harmony.</p>
                        <p>The treatment of the military in the first part seems to be an especially
                            bad example of misuse of fact. The contention is made that the officer
                            corps is probably in a better position under <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> than it was under <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>. Apparently this is based on the elevation of a
                            number of general officers and marshals to higher ranks in 1955. The
                            authors seem to forget that there were a number of promotions when
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> was Chairman of the
                            Council of Ministers; that the call-up and discharge procedure was put
                            on a more regular basis in 1953; and that other privileges were granted
                            and efforts made to raise the prestige of the military before <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> was ousted. It should be
                            recalled, also, that <persName>Marshal Zhukov</persName> was promoted to
                            a top military position and subsequently elected to the Party Central
                            Committee in the period of <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> ascendancy. The purported satisfaction of the
                            military in 1955 over their budget is unconvincing. Although the
                            publicly-announced amount increased in 1955 over 1954, there is great
                            uncertainty as to the actual total.</p>

                        <p><persName>Shanley</persName> said that <persName>Dulles</persName>, in
                            talking to him, had asked him to check with me to see how I felt about
                            such a request before we talked to the President.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had explained to
                                <persName>Shanley</persName> that usually under diplomatic protocol,
                            whenever an Ambassador of any kind requested an appointment with the
                            President to present a message from his Head of State, it was granted.
                                <persName>Shanley</persName> and I both agreed that we would tell
                            the President of the request and also about <persName corresp="#p_FAB1"
                                >Foster</persName>’s recommendation that the President see him. We
                            discussed briefly the time of the appointment, and both of us agreed
                            that we should not put it on the President’s schedule before the press
                            conference, which was scheduled for 10:30 A.M. tomorrow. We agreed on
                            suggesting to him the hour of 11:30.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName>Shanley</persName> if the State Department had told him
                            what it was about, and he said that they had not and that the Embassy
                            had not given Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> any
                            indication of the contents of the message.</p>
                        <p>When the President came back from lunch at 2 o’clock, we went in to see
                            him and inform him of the request. He agreed with
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ recommendation and said that he would
                            see the Russian Ambassador either at 3:30 that afternoon or at 11:30 the
                            next morning—“or any other time that <persName corresp="#p_FAB1"
                                >Foster</persName> recommends.” He asked us if we knew what the
                            Russian Ambassador wanted to see him about, and we told him the State
                            Department said they didn’t know. He asked us to recheck with
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> on the time of the appointment. As we
                            were leaving the room, he called me back and said, “Jim, see what
                            information you can get.”</p>

                            waiting for me, and we had a meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, on
                            the subject.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> started off the conversation by telling me
                            that the call had come in earlier that morning from the Soviet Chargé
                            d’Affaires to <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livingston
                            Merchant</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> was
                            out of town in New York. The Chargé d’Affaires, requesting the
                            appointment in the name of the Ambassador, said that the Ambassador had
                            a personal message from <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                            to be delivered to the President. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> asked the Chargé if he could tell him what the
                            message was, and the Chargé repeated quite bluntly that it was a
                            “personal” message from <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livingston</persName> then asked if it
                            dealt with disarmament and the Chargé said that it did not. That was as
                            far as <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> could go. He had
                            to drop the conversation.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> then said that the message could be any
                            number of things but that he and <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Herbert
                                Hoover, Jr.</persName> thought they had a good <gloss
                                target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of what it was. They said that they
                            were sure this sudden Soviet move, with the request that the Ambassador
                            personally deliver the message (the first time that the Soviets have
                            requested an appointment since we have been in office—or as a matter of
                            fact, some time prior to that) was undoubtedly in line with some new
                            Soviet propaganda program. <persName>Dulles</persName> stressed the
                            point that the Chargé d’Affaires’ answer that it did not deal with
                            disarmament would in <persName>Dulles</persName>’ opinion eliminate a
                            possibility that it might deal with some aspects of the President’s
                            “Open Sky” proposal.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> said that what he thought it was was a very
                            strong Soviet protest on our secret “Weather Balloons”. This program was
                                <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0073"/>started in full swing three
                            weeks ago, and at the time it was started we expected that it would take
                            the Soviets about three weeks to catch up with it. We know that some of
                            these balloons were shot down by Soviet aircraft and anti-aircraft fire.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he expected the protest, if
                            that is what it was, to be coupled with another attack against the
                            President’s “Open Sky” recommendation. He said that he expected that the
                            protest would cite the “weather balloons” as another instance of the
                            United States attempting to get military information over Soviet
                            territory and that the “Open Sky” recommendations were merely another
                            step in that direction.</p>
                        <p>The Air Force publicly announced the “weather balloons” in connection
                            with the National Geophysical Year but that the announcement had not
                            received much attention. He (<persName>Dulles</persName>) said it was
                            extremely lucky that there had been news stories of late about the
                            weather balloons in Tokyo which had been floated over the Pacific Ocean
                            and which were presently floating around the skies of Texas and
                            Oklahoma.</p>
                        <p>If this protest followed along these lines, we would, of course, deny it
                            and say that we were participating, as we had already long since
                            announced, in research for the Geophysical Year and that such research
                            would be made available to all countries.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName>Dulles</persName> if the Ambassador himself would call
                            on the President, and after checking with <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Livingston Merchant</persName>, he said that the appointment itself
                            would be made with <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName>.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> also thought that if they were right in their
                            guess, the Russians would put out a copy of the letter from Moscow at
                            about the time <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> was
                            seeing the President. That would launch a world–wide propaganda campaign
                            against the United States, picking up the old charges of war mongering
                            and all the rest.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName>Dulles</persName> that normally I announce the
                            President’s schedule at four o’clock for the next day and that if the
                            appointment with <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> were
                            set for 11:30, I would, of course, have to announce it at four. He
                            agreed that this was the way to do it to make it as routine as possible
                            although we both realized that the Russian Ambassador visiting the
                            President was in itself a news story. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                            he thought I should say in my announcement that protocol had been
                            observed/that the call had come in to <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Livingston Merchant</persName> and had been relayed to the
                            Appointment Secretary at the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                                >White</persName> House. He also said that he thought I should say
                            that the Ambassador was going to deliver a personal message from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> so that this would
                            show the world that this was handling the call on a strictly diplomatic
                            routine basis.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> also wanted me to tell the President that the
                            reason he was urging this so strongly was that if the President saw
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> to deliver a message
                            from <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, he would think
                            that the Kremlin <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0074"/>would have a
                            difficult job in the future of declining to see Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName> with messages from the
                            President that we wanted to get into the Kremlin. In the past the
                            Russians have insisted that <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> present messages from the President to the
                            Russian Foreign Minister, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                            >Molotov</persName>, instead of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>. We have always felt that it would be much
                            better if our Ambassador could deliver personal messages from the
                            President directly to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>
                            without having to go through <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> asked me to go back and get to the President
                            with this information as soon as I could and then let him know of the
                            President’s final decision. He said the Russian Embassy had been calling
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s office every hour
                            on the hour to see if the State Department had an answer and that he
                            wanted to give the answer to them as soon as possible. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> that I would do so and left his
                            office, returning immediately to the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                                >White</persName> House.<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">After <persName

                                    >Merchant</persName> at 2:23 p.m. to verify that it was the
                                Soviet Ambassador and not the Chargé who wished to see the
                                President. The Secretary also called <persName corresp="#p_HF1"
                                    >Howe</persName> at 2:29 to ask who made the original
                                announcement, and <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName>
                                indicated that it was the Air Force in California. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName> subsequently called back and
                                transmitted the message through <persName corresp="#p_BP1"
                                    >Bernau</persName> that there had been a simultaneous release to
                                the Associated Press ticker in Washington and at the launching site
                                in Vernalis, California. <persName corresp="#p_HF1">Howe</persName>
                                said that the announcement had not been picked up particularly by
                                American newspapers, but it had been by the foreign press, including
                                British and French newspapers. He noted also that subsequent
                                releases conforming to the original release had been made in Tokyo,
                                Hawaii, Alaska, and Germany, and the Air Force believed that a
                                release was made in Norway as well. (Eisenhower Library, Dulles

                        <p>When I got back, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>
                            was with the President briefing him on National Security Council
                            matters, but I sent in a note through <persName>Shanley</persName>
                            saying that <persName>Dulles</persName> had asked me to come to his
                            office and that he had some confidential information which he wanted me
                            to tell the President as soon as possible. <persName>Shanley</persName>
                            brought the note in and came out to tell me that the President would see
                            me in ten minutes just as soon as he finished with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AD1">Dillon Anderson</persName>. When
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> came out, I went in to see the
                            President and told him of my talk with <persName>Dulles</persName>. He
                            readily agreed that he should not see the Russian Ambassador before the
                            press conference and then said, “<persName corresp="#p_FAB1"
                                >Foster</persName> may be right on his guess. I haven’t thought too
                            much of this balloon thing and I don’t blame the Russians at all. I’ve
                            always thought it was sort of a dirty trick. But that was the gamble we
                            took when we made the decision and they ought to have a good answer
                            ready for me if I have to use it when I see the Ambassador. You call
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> and tell him that I
                            want his suggestions for that answer over in my office in a sealed
                            envelope no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning. Also tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> that I want him here with me
                            when the Ambassador comes in.</p>

                        <p>I also told the President that I would have to announce this at four
                            o’clock, saying that <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> was
                            coming to see him and he asked me why I had to do that and why I could
                            not postpone it until tomorrow. “If you announce it today, you’ll have a
                            whole flock of cameramen and reporters outside.” I told the President
                            that this would be so but that <persName corresp="#p_FAB1"
                                >Foster</persName> and I agreed that it should be put on the
                            schedule and handled as routinely as possible. I said that we both felt
                            that the Russian Embassy would leak the appointment and that this would
                            cause more confusion and more mystery than a straightforward
                            announcement of it from the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                                >White</persName> House. He thought that over for a minute and then
                            said, “Yes, I guess that’s right. O.K. You announce it at four.”</p>
                        <p>The President also said that he was quite sure that this was undoubtedly
                            part of a Soviet propaganda move timed deliberately to break just before
                            his meeting with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>.<note n="6" xml:id="d18fn6"><persName

                            however, warned that we must not at anytime close the door on such
                            messages as this coming through and would have to receive them and give
                            them study no matter whether we might be convinced in advance that they
                            were merely propaganda steps.<note n="7" xml:id="d18fn7"><persName

                        <p>In at 8:00. Went in to see the President after the press conference staff
                            meeting. I told him that I had been thinking about what the message
                            might contain and that while I thought <persName corresp="#p_FAB1"
                                >Foster</persName> probably might be right, I had also thought
                            overnight of several other things it could be. Among these were: (1) A
                            request by <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> to visit this country
                            following their visit to England; (2) A seeming acceptance of some
                            phases of the President’s “Open Sky” program with a lot of strings
                            attached; (3) A statement to the <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0076"
                            />President that the Russians would agree with the United States to call
                            off all thermo-nuclear tests.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he thought that those could also be considered as
                            possibilities and then he smiled calmly and said, “Well, we’ll know the
                            answer in a few hours.” He told me to call <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            and tell him to be on hand in his office before the Soviet Ambassador
                            arrived at the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House.</p>
                        <p>When we returned from the press conference, the President had an
                            appointment with <persName corresp="#p_LCB1">Clare Booth Luce</persName>
                            and <persName>Dulles</persName> arrived in
                            <persName>Shanley’</persName>s office about 11:20. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> arrived at the <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House at 11:25 and pushed his

                            of the Executive offices without any comment. He was accompanied by John
                            Simmons who escorted him to the conference room. I met him there and
                            told him the President would be with him in a few minutes. He said he
                            was glad to see me and that he had not seen me since Geneva. I replied
                            that I was glad to see him. We were in the conference room with
                            Alexander Logofet, the State Department interpreter. <persName

                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>His remarks were necessarily of a very preliminary
                                    character,</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>He was absolutely and most completely sincere in his
                                    conviction of the need for better relations between our
                                    countries.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>He had been concerned with the deterioration in those
                                    relations since the meeting of last July.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>He shared the view that the peoples of the Soviet Union and
                                    the United States wanted peace.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>He would give serious study to the proposal now made by
                                    Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and in
                                    due course make a written reply.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The President then asked whether it was the view of the Soviet Government
                            that the proposal should be kept confidential, at least for the time
                            being. The President expressed the view that the matter could be
                            developed more productively if it were treated as confidential, but that
                            we would of course acquiesce in whatever the views of the Soviet
                            Government were in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Ambassador stated that he had no instructions from his
                            Government on this point, but would immediately communicate with his
                            Government, and in the meantime would not disclose the nature of the
                            communication. He expressed his personal agreement with the point of
                            view on this matter expressed by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I then indicated that perhaps the Soviet Ambassador had better follow the
                            usual practice, which is that after talking with the President, visitors
                            make no statement of their own, but leave it to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House to make such statement as
                            it deemed appropriate. The Ambassador said he would follow this
                            practice.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>Thereupon the President and I sought to formulate the statement which the
                            White House would issue and it was agreed that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> would put out a statement which
                            would say in substance that there had been a friendly communication from
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> to the
                            President which was another one of the communications which they had
                            exchanged since becoming acquainted at the Summit Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Ambassador expressed his accord with a statement of this
                            general character. Thereupon the Soviet Ambassador and the interpreter
                            retired.</p>
                        <p>The President and I then discussed the situation briefly. I said that I
                            felt it probable that this was essentially a propaganda move, but that,
                            of course, we should not jump to that conclusion. I said I saw
                            significance in the fact that this proposal was made as a bilateral
                            proposal to the United States, apparently without corresponding the
                            proposal to the UK and France, although this might come later.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows the beginning of the entry.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> was in the President’s
                            office for fifteen minutes and left at 11:45. He declined any comment at
                            all to the reporters in the lobby other than to say that he thought the
                            President was looking fine. This was in accordance with the President’s
                            wishes and the agreement that <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1"
                                >Zaroubin</persName> had made in the President’s office. When the
                            Ambassador left, the President called for me and I went into his office
                            through Ann Whitman’s office. <persName>Dulles</persName> was alone with
                            him. As I walked in, the President said, “Well, Jim, it wasn’t what we
                            thought. There is no mention of the balloons.”</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> said that he was quite surprised that it had
                            not been balloons but then laughed and said, “Maybe that’s what you get
                            for having somewhat of a guilty conscience.” The President replied that
                            he was sure that the Russians knew about the balloons and that they
                            might bring it up at some later date. The President then told me that he
                            had agreed that there would be no publication now of <pb n="49"
                                xml:id="pg_49" facs="0079"/>the letter but that he had also told the
                            Soviet Ambassador that I would make a short statement. He then said,
                            “Why don’t you say something like this: “Intermittently since the Geneva
                            Conference the President and Premier <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> have been exchanging correspondence. The Soviet
                            Ambassador brought in a letter containing certain ideas which the
                            Premier has asked the President to study.”</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> interrupted to say that he thought the letter
                            should be described as “friendly” and the President said Yes, I should
                            put that in. He then told me that he thought I should add that the
                            Premier had asked the President to study the ideas further in the
                            interest of promoting world peace. The President agreed to this and I
                            revised my statement accordingly.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the President and the Secretary if they thought there was
                            any danger of the message breaking from Moscow. The President said he
                            did not think so, at least at this time, since he had raised that point
                            with <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> and said that it
                            probably should be released at a later date. <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1"
                                >Zaroubin</persName> said that he would check with his government
                            and let <persName>Dulles</persName> know.</p>
                        <p>I held my press conference on the statement and declined to answer other
                            questions. Speculation throughout the day was on almost every subject
                            conceivable, ranging from a story by the New York <hi rend="italic"
                                >Daily News</hi> that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> had invited themselves to this country to
                            others more near the mark on the renewal of the “Spirit of Geneva.”</p>
                        <p>I talked to <persName>Dulles</persName> later in the day, and we both
                            agreed that it was a very clever letter which the Soviets would
                            undoubtedly use for propaganda purposes. The <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                >idea</gloss> of a 20-year Treaty of Friendship with the United
                            States, <persName>Dulles</persName> told me, was not a new one.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had discussed it with
                            him at Geneva. There is nothing proposed in the Treaty which cannot be
                            done through the machinery of the United Nations to which both the
                            United States and the USSR have pledged themselves.</p>
                        <p><persName>Dulles</persName> said that his guess is that the Russians have
                            realized since Geneva that they have given the impression to the free
                            world, and to much of the neutral world, that they have broken
                            agreements which they made at Geneva and are desperately trying to get
                            back into the “big smile and friendly neighbor” attitude. At any rate,
                            the proposal for a treaty will be sure to touch off a very lengthy
                            debate in this country, and <persName>Dulles</persName> believes that we
                            should turn it down politely, pointing out that we want deeds not
                            words.</p>
                        <p>Later in the day I got a query from the British press as to whether we
                            were going to wireless a copy of the letter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on board the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Queen Elizabeth</hi> and I called <persName>Dulles</persName> again
                            and told him of my query and he said I had better duck that one, that we
                            could not <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0080"/>officially send
                            anything like that to the British without including the French and
                            possibly the Italians and Germans.</p>
                        <p>I received a copy of the translation of the letter, the memorandum of
                            conversation in the President’s office and the proposed text of the
                            Treaty at my home at 8:30. I wanted it in case the news broke from
                            Moscow or leaked from Washington. Radio Moscow played it perfectly
                            straight that evening and merely said that the message from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had been delivered to the
                            President and that the American press showed great interest in it.</p>
                        <p>I had only one call during the evening, that from Bob Clark of INS,
                            checking on the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> story of a <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> visit to this country. I told Bob that I
                            could not comment but if I were in his place, I would advise the INS not
                            to pick it up.</p>

                        <p>I went in to see the President early in the morning to tell him that I
                            had been thinking about the message overnight, that I thought it was
                            very cleverly phrased and that I thought we should get it out publicly
                            as soon as possible. He told me that he thought that was right but that
                            we would have to wait until we heard back from <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> since he had requested
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGN1">Zaroubin</persName> to check with his
                            government. He laughingly told me that he was somewhat relieved at the
                            proposals made in the message because—“I had another <gloss
                                target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> what it was that I didn’t tell
                            anyone. I thought that it was an invitation from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> for me to visit Russia. That
                            would have been something to give us a lot of thought.” I asked the
                            President if he would have accepted. He merely laughed in reply and
                            said, “Well, we didn’t get the invitation.”</p>
                        <p>Turning back to our original subject of release of the letter, the
                            President asked me to discuss it with <persName>Dulles</persName>. I saw
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> before the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting and told him my feeling that we should get it
                            out. He said he agreed with me and the longer we held it, the more the
                            Russian propaganda machine would be able to build it up as a great new
                            proposal which in effect was merely a repetition of all the previous
                            Russian proposals rolled into one. He said that he was going to ask the
                            President to discuss it with just the members of the <pb n="51"
                                xml:id="pg_51" facs="0081"/>Security Council in his office after the
                            meeting. This the President did.<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">No record of
                                this discussion has been found.</note></p>
                        <p>Later before <persName>Dulles</persName> left the <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House we had another discussion
                            and he asked me personally to discuss it with the President to see if we
                            could get authority from the President to ask <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCEC1">Chip Bohlen</persName> to get an agreement to
                            release the correspondence. I said I thought there would probably have
                            to be a <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House statement in
                            connection with the release, and he agreed. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            said that he thought it should be clearly pointed out that there were no
                            new proposals and that it should not be considered too seriously. What
                            they are trying to do by this maneuver is to try to sell us a Treaty of
                            Friendship and then go around and put pressure on all the smaller
                            countries to do the same. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter
                            provides for everything they propose, particularly the settlement of
                            international disputes by peaceful means and it would simply break up
                            the United Nations and put a lot of pressure on all the other countries
                            of the world. “I’m against it, and it should be rejected, although I
                            suppose we must say that we are studying it.” I told the Secretary I
                            would talk to the President when he came back from lunch.</p>
                        <p>When the President returned from lunch, I told him of my conversation
                            with <persName>Dulles</persName> and the President said that if
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> thought we were aiding
                            the Communists by holding it up, we should release it, but he insisted
                            that we should not do it on our own but we should get Russian agreement.
                            I told <persName>Dulles</persName> of this conversation and when he went
                            in to see the President on the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> visit, the President discussed it with
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> and also gave him authority to wireless
                            a synopsis of the letter to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            on board the <hi rend="italic">Queen Elizabeth.</hi> (This was the first
                            time such authority was given, and it was strange that earlier in the
                            day, a short <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> story from the <hi
                                rend="italic">Queen Elizabeth</hi> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> were conferring together on the contents of the
                            letter. Until the President gave authority, no such message had been
                            sent to either <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName> or
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on board the ship and
                            the story was probably either a complete dope story by a reporter or fed
                            out by a British member of the party to give the impression that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had been cut in on it.)
                            The wireless went off about three o’clock.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">A

                        <p>Later in the evening I received press calls, particularly from Bill

                        <p>I had a rough night last night on this whole matter. The <hi

                            that Russia was offering us a bilateral Treaty of Friendship or
                            non-aggression pact and I received quite a few calls starting at 10:30
                            P.M. and running through until about 3:00 A.M. To all of them I replied
                            I had no further comment other than what I had said the first day on the
                            message, and that was that.</p>
                        <p>When I called <persName>Dulles</persName> at nine this morning, I said to
                            him, “Good morning, Mr. Secretary, this is your midnight correspondent.”
                            He laughed and asked if I had many queries last night and I told him I
                            had. He was not attending the Cabinet meeting because he was <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0083"/>working with his people on a draft
                            report turning down the Russian proposal. He thought it was particularly

                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>I saw the Secretary at 2:25 just before he went in to see the President
                            on the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> visit, and he said he
                            had been working all day on the reply and that he expected to have a
                            draft over for the President’s study by 3:30. I told him that I had been
                            queried by some of the newspaper people as to whether or not the United
                            States or the Administration would fill in in a bi-partisan way the
                            leadership of Congress before any action was taken on this publicly. He
                            said we probably should do that and that the leaders on both sides
                            should know in advance that we were going to turn it down.</p>

                        <p>On Saturday, January 28, the United States Government released the text
                            of <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s letter of January
                            23 to the President, along with a reply dated January 28 by the
                            President. In his reply, the President noted that a number of provisions
                            in the proposed treaty of friendship and cooperation were already
                            contained in the United Nations Charter, to which both countries were
                            signatories, and he wondered “whether again going through a
                            treaty-making procedure, and this time on a bilateral basis only, might
                            indeed work against the cause of peace by creating the illusion that a
                            stroke of a pen had achieved a result which in fact can be achieved only
                            by a change of spirit.” The President reiterated the United States
                            Government’s dedication to achieving progress on the three issues
                            discussed at the Geneva Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers
                            meetings the previous year—namely, European security and Germany,
                            disarmament, and East-West contacts—and said he was looking forward to

                                <p>“A. is watching Genetrix, and has some people in his office on it
                                    now. The Sec. is anxious to keep close watch on the extent to
                                    which they are coming through and be alert to any evidence there
                                    is of diminishing returns. The Sec. wants to stop it if it gets
                                    to that basis. A. said they are talking of the Air Force desire
                                    to raise the daily launching rate to 40 per day—only 11 went up
                                    yesterday. A few are coming through now and some have begun to
                                    transmit but have not reached the area of cutdown. A. will come
                                    up after he finishes with the people there. The Sec. said he and
                                    the Pres. are nervous about it. If it is not producing
                                    substantial returns, he does not want to go on about it. We
                                    found out what can be done and probably discovered some bugs in
                                    the thing. They agreed the time for protest is near. (Memorandum

                            United States reconnaissance balloon flights over the Soviet Union, as

                            before. The note indicated that some of the reconnaissance balloons,
                            with “automatically operated photo cameras for aerial survey, radio
                            transmitters, radio receivers and other things,” had been captured. For

                                    the results would justify the inconvenience involved. The

                                    I agreed, but said I thought we should handle it so it would not

                        <p>On February 8, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName>
                            delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry a reply to the Soviet note of

                            directly or indirectly participating in any project to dispatch
                            propaganda balloons over the Soviet Union.” The note also explained that
                            the other balloons were meteorological balloons, the launching of which
                            had been announced publicly on January 8, and gave the following
                            description of the project: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The balloons are equipped with instruments to measure and record
                                    meteorological phenomena such as air jet streams, and with
                                    photographic apparatus to provide pictures of cloud formations
                                    which bear on air movements at various velocities. Much valuable
                                    scientific information is being accumulated. It is hoped that
                                    this method of meteorological research will contribute
                                    substantially to the forthcoming International Geophysical Year
                                    programs.</p>
                                <p>“The declared purpose of the project is made clear by the fact
                                    that the equipment itself contains instructions in several
                                    languages, including Russian, for its recovery and delivery to
                                    the authorities charged with the evaluation of the data
                                    obtained. In the interest of scientific research, it would be
                                    much appreciated if the Soviet Government would return the
                                    instruments which have come into its possession.</p>
                                <p>“Similar surveys have been conducted for some time through the
                                    launching of some thousands of meteorological balloons over the
                                    United States. These have been equipped with safety devices and
                                    have constituted no hazard even to dense civilian air traffic.
                                    As explained in the announcement, the balloons observed by the
                                    Soviet Government are equipped with the same safety devices.</p>
                                <p>“The United States Government would be happy to explain further
                                    to the Soviet Government the safety measures incorporated in the
                                    project. Provisionally, however, in order to avoid
                                    misunderstandings, and in view of the Soviet Government’s
                                    objection, the United States Government will seek to avoid the
                                    launching of additional balloons which, on the basis of known
                                    data might transit the USSR.”</p>

                        <p>The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is scheduled
                            to meet in Moscow, February 14, 1956. Under the Soviet system the Party
                            is the directing and controlling force in the Soviet state, and the
                            Party Congress is theoretically the supreme Party forum. The Party
                            itself has been alternately subjected to the control of a few persons,
                            or of one person, i.e., STALIN, who became the unquestioned master of
                            both Party and state.</p>
                        <p>Six Party Congresses were held before the October Revolution, in various
                            countries. From 1918 to 1925, Congresses were held annually. The 15th
                            Congress was held in 1927, and the 16th, 17th and 18th in 1930, 1934 and
                            1939, respectively. At the 17th Congress in 1934, it was decided that
                            Party Congresses would be held every three years. This rule was not
                            observed. It was not until October 1952 that the 19th Congress was
                            held.</p>
                        <p>At the 19th Congress many changes were made in Party rules. The word
                            “bolshevik” was dropped from the name of the Party, which became the
                            “Communist Party of the Soviet Union.” The Politburo was replaced by a
                            larger Presidium, and the Central Committee was enlarged. After the
                            death of STALIN, the Presidium was reduced in size, so that it was again
                            numerically comparable to the old Politburo.</p>
                        <p>The convening of the 20th Party Congress was announced by the Soviet
                            press on July 14, 1955. The decision was made a few days previously by

                        <p>Delegates to the 20th Party Congress have been and are being selected by
                            oblast, krai and republic Party Congresses. These meetings have been
                            accompanied by announcement of certain changes in the positions of state
                            and Party leaders. These changes give some reason to believe that the
                            Congress itself may reveal certain other adjustments in the top Party
                            leadership. There has been speculation that Party First Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> is strengthening
                            his position as top man of the Party hierarchy. For the present,
                            however, it seems unlikely that he will yet assume the position once
                            occupied by STALIN.</p>
                        <p>The draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will no doubt be adopted
                            in approximately their present form.</p>
                        <p>It is also possible that the Congress may receive a report from the
                            special committee created in 1952 to revise the Party Program. There
                            have been no published revisions of the Program of the Party adopted in
                            1919. The special committee was headed by STALIN, and included Beria,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KL1">Kaganovich</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> and several others. Since STALIN and Beria are
                            dead and <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> has been
                            demoted, the special committee has presumably been reorganized in the
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>The 20th Party Congress will probably not bring any surprises on policy
                            issues. The post-STALIN leadership has been rather voluble in the
                            discussion of Party lines and purposes. Nevertheless, the proceedings of
                            the 20th Congress will be followed with considerable interest,
                            particularly from the standpoint of any possible personnel shifts within
                            the Party hierarchy, and tightening up of Party ideology.</p>

                        <p>It is not in our interest to give the 20th Party Congress undue public
                            attention. The proceedings should be reported factually and objectively
                            without any great amount of commentary on the news emanating from the
                            Congress itself. If the Congress should develop news of a sensational
                            character, further guidance will be given.</p>
                        <p>The meeting of the 20th Party Congress offers a good opportunity to
                            illustrate the great contrast between the Soviet one-party dictatorship
                            and our democratic system of parties and government. The fact that this
                            is an election year in the United States underlines the appropriateness
                            of comment along these lines.</p>
                        <p>The subserviency of national Communist parties to the Soviet Party and to
                            Soviet policy can be underlined by appropriate noting of attendance at
                            the Moscow sessions by representatives of these parties.</p>

                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> may have been referring to the
                                plenary session of the Communist Party Central Committee held on
                                February 27.</note> The composition of the new Presidium (Politburo)
                            had not yet been announced, but it seemed unlikely that there would be
                            significant changes in the top personnel. 60% of the new Presidium
                            consisted of members who had been re-elected; 40% were newly elected. Of
                            the latter group, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            obtained a large number of his own supporters. Mr.

                            to see whether <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would
                            continue in the roster of the eleven full members of the Presidium. That
                            he would was likely, although his position was weakening and he might
                            disappear from power in a year’s time.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President interrupted to ask who would be <persName

                            disappear, and would this successor be even more anti-Western than
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> replied to the President by stating that

                            indicated that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was preparing
                            complete texts of all the speeches. These would prove, he believed, very
                            significant guides to Soviet intentions. We had somewhat neglected these
                            speeches in the past, just as we had unfortunately neglected Hitler’s

                            repeat this error. The President asked Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            to brief down these speeches and send copies of the briefs to all
                            interested members of the National Security Council.<note n="5"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> on the
                            importance of trying to find out what the Soviets were actually
                            circulating as guides for the conduct of members of the Communist Party.
                            We must pay close attention to what they are teaching to their
                            subordinate party members. It was this kind of information which would
                            provide real indications of possible changes in the Soviet Union. Such
                            indications were far more significant than what the Soviet leaders said
                            to the outside world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then went on to
                            sum up the significance of the Party Congress. In the first place, the
                            present collective leadership of the Soviet Union is accomplishing a
                            peaceful evolution to replace Stalinist control. They were dropping the
                                <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of absolute dictatorship; they
                            were minimizing the threat of military power to accomplish their ends;
                            and they seemed to be abandoning the dogma of the inevitability of war
                            with the imperialist powers. Three main anti-Stalinist ideas had been
                            spelled out at the Party Congress. First, the <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                >idea</gloss> of collective leadership; second, stress on peaceful
                            coexistence rather than on the inevitability of war; and third, peaceful
                            transition to socialism through parliamentary mechanism. This latter
                            point seemed to indicate a strong Soviet drive in the direction of
                            establishing popular front governments in other countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> predicted that many old-line Communists
                            outside the USSR would find it extremely difficult to accept the new
                            doctrines set forth at the Party Congress. There will be widespread
                            dangers of Titoism. Indeed, Tito believes that the Soviet Union has
                            bought his doctrines lock, stock and barrel.<note n="6" xml:id="d27fn6"

                                    meeting of the National Security Council on March 1, the
                                    following comments were made:</p>
                                <p>“Turning to the final situation in the new Soviet Politburo, Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed
                                    out that there had been no change respecting the full regular
                                    members of this group. <persName>Marshal Zhukov</persName>,
                                    however, had been elected a candidate member of the Politburo
                                    and, so far as Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> could recall,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> was the first
                                    Army officer ever to attain this height in Soviet history.
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> turned
                                    to the President and said that <persName>Marshal

                                >Bulganin</persName>’s letter of February 1 to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> reiterating the Soviet
                            proposal for a treaty of friendship and cooperation with the United
                            States (see <ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>) extended through the
                            month of February. Draft replies dated February 9, 12, and 23 are in

                            233, <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>One view of the significance of the Soviet proposal was that the Soviet
                            Government feared the imminent outbreak of hostilities between the
                            United States and Communist China and it desired a Soviet-American
                            treaty as a hedge against China’s invoking the Sino-Soviet mutual
                            assistance pact and involving the Soviet Union in war with the United
                            States. This view was advanced by Galen L. Stone, Second Secretary of
                            the Embassy in France, in a letter of February 8 to Robert Kranich in
                            the Office of European Regional Affairs. According to a memorandum from
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> to Allan Evans in
                            the Office of Intelligence Research, dated February 16, Stone’s letter
                            and the hypothesis it contained were discussed with “considerable
                            interest” at the Secretary of State’s Staff meeting the previous day and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> had been requested
                            to prepare an analysis of the hypothesis. Evans sent his comments on the
                            hypothesis to <persName corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> in a
                            memorandum dated February 23, in which he concluded that “although the
                            suggestion is a novel one, we consider it to be without validity insofar
                            as available information can be a guide,” evidence that pointed to “the
                            closest collaboration between the USSR and Communist China, particularly
                            since the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>–<persName

                                corresp="#p_AWPJ1">Armstrong</persName> passed on Evans’ comments in
                            somewhat abbreviated form in a memorandum of February 27 to <persName

                        <p>It was apparently the February 23 draft reply that was discussed by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in a telephone
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Robert Bowie</persName> on
                            February 24. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that the
                            United States would be helping the Soviet leaders if it made a
                            “full-dress” reply to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s
                            letter. He suggested merely adding something about the Soviet proposal
                            to <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0092"/>a letter on the subject of
                            disarmament that was also being drafted for the President to send to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>. In an apparent
                            reference to the speeches at the 20th Party Congress, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> noted that the Soviet leaders
                            “have said in effect we made a lot of blunders under STALIN, but we are
                            not like him.” The full-dress reply, according to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>, made it possible for the Soviet
                            leaders “to say we are raking up old stuff etc.”
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said he would like to give the President
                            a choice of which way to respond. (Memorandum of telephone conversation

                        <p>On February 25, <persName>Dulles</persName> sent to the President a draft

                            explaining the two options and expressing his belief that any middle
                            course would be unsatisfactory. On February 27, <persName

                            had no objection to either course, provided that the full-dress reply
                            was modified so as to include “both our negative bill of particulars as

                        <p rend="center">THE TWENTIETH CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET
                            UNION</p>
                        <p rend="center">Abstract</p>
                        <p>The first public criticism of STALIN by his successors stands out as the
                            highlight and main innovation of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist
                            Party of the Soviet Union (February 14 to 25). Otherwise, the conclave
                            served largely as an authoritative occasion for the Soviet rulers to
                            confirm and formalize their current policies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Criticism of STALIN.</hi> In the nearly three years
                            since his death, STALIN’s stature has been progressively reduced. The
                            new regime shrank the symbol of STALIN largely by withholding adulation
                            from him and concentrating it entirely on Lenin. The Congress has now
                            marked a further distinctive step as the rulers took to open attack.
                            Their criticism centered chiefly on the ill-effects of one-man rule,
                            with its glorification of an all-wise leader. Beyond this, however,
                            while they neither completely buried STALIN nor brought into question
                            his basic state policies, they ranged critically over many fields,
                            including economic development, ideology, law and foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet rulers are rewriting history and rehabilitating some of
                            STALIN’s victims; how much further they will go remains to be seen.
                            Clearly to find clay feet on the infallible demi-god whose rule for
                            three decades encompassed all facets of Soviet life will have widespread
                            effects—but effects whose manifestations will depend upon a whole
                            complex of related factors.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Collective Rule.</hi> The attack on one-man rule served
                            to underscore the virtue claimed for collective leadership which,
                            formally enshrined as a guiding principle, has thus become an obstacle
                            to concentration of overwhelming power in the hands of one individual.
                            That the present ruling group is stable appears from the absence of
                            changes among full members of the Party Presidium. New and younger blood
                            has been brought to the top circle by the candidate members, expanded to
                            six.</p>
                        <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>Inclusion in the latter group of <persName>Marshal Zhukov</persName>, the
                            first professional military chief to reach Presidium level, appears to
                            represent both recognition of him personally and appreciation of the
                            military ingredient in policy-making rather than an indication that the
                            armed forces are growing to be a distinct political force.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> received no special
                            build-up at the Congress, but his leadership within the ruling group was
                            strengthened by the number of new Presidium candidate members and new
                            members of the Central Committee who have had past links with him.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs.</hi> In foreign affairs the Soviet
                            rulers claimed major successes for their current policy and announced
                            they would pursue it with greater vigor. They set forth as the
                            underlying basis of their policy the thesis that peaceful coexistence is
                            “the only alternative” to nuclear war, and they indicated that the USSR
                            will energetically champion coexistence as an activist program aimed at
                            undermining Western defense efforts. They called for the development of
                            friendly relations throughout the world, and especially with the
                            underdeveloped countries. Although this policy was to apply also to the
                            major Western powers, it was not meant to imply concessions on major
                            East-West issues. Their goal was evidently to remove apprehensions of a
                            Soviet threat and instead to imbue the USSR with an air of
                            respectability, normalcy, and tolerance.</p>
                        <p>To further this impression, the Soviet rulers readjusted their
                            ideological stance: they stressed the preventability rather than the
                            inevitability of war and, without renouncing violence, they sanctioned
                            for foreign Communists a “non-violent” acquisition of power by
                            parliamentary means. They sought both to assure non-Communists that the
                            USSR is not wedded to violence and to reassure Communists that a period
                            of coexistence would not undercut their struggle for the promised
                            ultimate victory of Communism nor jeopardize the prospect of winning
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Any improvement in state-to-state relations between Communists and
                            non-Communists would involve no ideological reconciliation. The speakers
                            confidently predicted the inevitable world triumph of Communism on the
                            grounds that Soviet military power would protect the Soviet base; that
                            continuing Soviet economic successes would inspire others to take the
                            Communist path; and that a majority of mankind, although representing
                            different views, was already joining together in “one mighty stream”
                            that would wash out the underpinnings of historically-doomed
                            capitalism.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Domestic Innovations.</hi> Traditional emphasis on
                            enforced industrialization and on the maintenance of high level
                            armaments continued at the Congress. It approved the Sixth Five-Year
                            Plan, announced in January, adding a provision for shortening the
                            work-week to 40–41 hours before 1960. A breakdown of investment figures
                            for 1956–60 <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0095"/>showed a marked
                            similarity, with some deviation in favor of agriculture, to the pattern
                            implemented in 1951–55.</p>
                        <p>The leaders showed some concern over living standards and promised to
                            bring up the level of the lowest-paid workers and pensioners while
                            retaining the present policy of a sharply differentiated income
                            structure. Another innovation was the proposal to establish fee-charging
                            boarding schools. Although justified in part as a way of meeting the
                            problem of children who lack adequate parental supervision, these
                            schools will probably be select elitetraining institutions.</p>
                        <p>The importance of these developments on the internal scene was less than
                            the implications of the attack on STALIN, which opens the way to a
                            re-evaluation of all sectors of Soviet life. In this sense the Congress
                            could turn out to be, in <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                            >Mikoyan</persName>’s words, “the most important Congress” in Soviet
                            Communist Party history since Lenin’s time.</p>

                        <p>1993. Yesterday evening at <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName>’s reception I had a series of extremely
                            interesting conversations with virtually all top leaders. In all my
                            experience in this country I have never seen them so relaxed or
                            forthcoming on variety of subjects. They answered individually, with
                            apparent frankness, almost any questions that I asked them.</p>
                        <p>I shall deal with these questions in separate telegrams<note n="2"

                            confidentiality. In general, however, since it is now apparent that
                            Soviet leaders in private conversation are disposed to talk very much
                            more frankly than in the past with foreign representatives here, I urge
                            Dept to make every effort to avoid leaks which could only impair real
                            possibilities of useful developments in this field.</p>

                            subject, I was personally convinced that an important element in his
                            decision was the feeling that the job of restoring some stability and
                            tranquility to the world was still to be done and was a sign of his deep
                            and genuine interest in working towards that end.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/>other members of the Soviet leadership I
                            would wish to have included. He said he thought it was most important at
                            this juncture that there should be means informal discussion “without
                            commitment”. Throughout evening <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> made great effort to impress upon me the
                            importance of US/Soviet relations and of the desire of Soviet Government
                            to see some genuine improvement in this field. I told him of course the
                            US had friends and allies and I could not go in for bilateral deals, to
                            which he replied that he had not in mind any deals behind backs of or at
                            expense of associates.</p>
                        <p>I am very anxious to safeguard the secrecy of this suggestion which at
                            some time in future [might] come in very useful. Obviously, in part at
                            least, it might be an attempt to sow suspicion with our allies, but I am
                            inclined more to believe that <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> recognizes need for some method of
                            communication rather than by official notes or highly publicized
                            communications. I shall of course never on my own initiative take up his
                            suggestion, and would only do so under explicit instructions from
                            Department. In addition, if any use is to be made of this offer I would
                            have to be much more fully aware than I am at present of our thinking on
                            outstanding questions.</p>
                        <p>I think it might be useful, if you agree, to bring this message to the
                            attention of the President as I believe almost for the first time since
                            I have been here possibilities of diplomatic action are really opening

                                in event of disagreement which cannot be ironed out in discussion a

                                set up for administrative reasons in order to render more orderly
                                the conduct of party business in the RSFSR where, as he said, there
                                were “large party organs” in Moscow, Leningrad and other areas. He
                                said past practice had shown that the previous mechanism was
                                inadequate to insure continuity and administration over these “big”
                                party organizations. In this sense the position of the RSFSR in the

                        <p>Taking advantage of the nature of conversation and in order to see his
                            reaction, I told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that
                            there had been some press comment that he was on the way to becoming
                            another “great leader.” His reaction was immediate and definite,
                            although he did not appear bothered by the question. He said that this
                            was “absolute nonsense” and “could not be” under present conditions. He
                            said that the objective circumstances of the Soviet Union rendered this
                            impossible. <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/>I received
                            subsequently from <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> a
                            statement along these same lines.</p>
                        <p>I was in a discussion with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> together when the subject of reasons for the
                            latter’s resignation came up. On this subject the party line was rather
                            closely adhered to since <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>
                            said that having been designated to head the group at time of STALIN’s
                            death it was found that he did not have enough “experience.” In reply to
                            my question on economic policy, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> admitted that certain adjustments had been
                            necessary. In part, he said, that this was because they came to realize
                            that disarmament was not an immediate prospect (although he did not say
                            so I think he had German rearmament in mind), but both denied with vigor
                            that there had been any “quarrel” between them on economic policy.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said “Why,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Georgi Malenkov</persName> is one of my
                            closest friends”. Of all the topics discussed I felt this one was the
                            least frank.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to these discussions <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName> gave me a brief description of how business was
                            conducted under STALIN, particularly in later years. He described these
                            as “difficult times” and said that STALIN made decisions on his own
                            frequently without any consultation “with any of us.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said this situation could not
                            be repeated after his death and that therefore the collective principle
                            was reinstated in the party. He said that by this procedure STALIN had
                            abolished the principle of voting in party organs and in effect had
                            destroyed their vitality and usefulness. On question of rewriting
                            history, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> said “under
                            present circumstances” it is essential that the history of Soviet Union
                            should be rewritten in order to conform with reality, and intimated that
                            the process might be quite far-reaching. He told me in all probability
                            that Lenin’s testament would be public and in reply to my question he
                            admitted the existence of a letter from Lenin to STALIN breaking off all
                            personal relations on the Georgian question referred to by Trotsky in
                            his biography of STALIN.</p>
                        <p>As a sidelight on attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>, at one point in conversation with <persName

                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> I mentioned that I had just
                            seen at the Indian Embassy a documentary film of the Indian trip and
                            said that there was one very interesting picture of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> getting on an elephant, to
                            which <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said “Yes, an
                            elephant getting on an elephant.”</p>
                        <p>At another time to both my wife and myself <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> said “You will understand why after the death
                            of STALIN we had to get rid of Beria.”</p>
                        <p>In general, whenever subject was mentioned all leaders I talked with
                            emphasized that under present conditions in Soviet Union collective
                            leadership was the only form of rule possible but did not <pb n="70"
                                xml:id="pg_70" facs="0100"/>do so with the appearance of voicing a
                            line concerted in advance, since in most cases they were in response to
                            specific questions from me on one of the other aspects treated
                            above.</p>
                        <p>I believe the foregoing will be of interest to Department, not because
                            remarks in themselves are of such great importance, but as an
                            illustration of the greater frankness with which these people are now
                            talking to foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Affairs. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> spoke
                            to me at some length on problem of disarmament, stating as already
                            reported he felt President’s message<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d28">Document 28</ref>.</note> had “certain positive
                            elements” in it. I told him I thought disarmament question seemed to be
                            in something of a chicken and an egg stage, since I am sure he realized
                            that the US and other Western nations could not accept any agreement on
                            disarmament until we were certain that workable and effective method of
                            inspection and control had been developed; to do otherwise would be to
                            take an unacceptable risk for national security. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said that he favored
                            control, but he thought their proposal of inspection airfields, ports,
                            railheads, etc would provide safeguard against surprise armed attack
                            based on his experiences in the war. I told him that development of
                            modern weapons had changed the picture since last war and, as President
                            indicated, combination President’s open skies proposal and Soviet plan
                            for inspection airfields, ports, etc could form basis for an adequate
                            inspection and control system. He reminded me of his observations to the
                            President at Geneva<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">For documentation on the
                                Geneva Heads of Government meeting, July 18–23, see <ref

                            and said in their view this could be culminating point of disarmament
                            structure but that present state of mistrust in world affairs did not
                            render it feasible. He admitted, in reply to my question, that what
                            chiefly concerned him was possibility that aerial inspection in itself
                            would not lead to disarmament and that when adequate photographs had
                            been taken it might be abandoned, and repeating his Geneva observation
                            said it was primarily an intelligence operation.</p>
                        <p>I told him I thought his fears were groundless, since that was not its
                            intention and indeed as President stated the very institution of aerial
                            photography would be probably the most effective means of dispelling
                            distrust and fear of surprise attack. He repeated several times, as did
                            subsequently <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, that the Soviet
                            Union was deadly serious in regard to disarmament and that they felt
                            that with genuine effort some common basis for agreement could be found.
                            He did not repeat in this conversation the usual charges that “certain
                            circles” in the US were blocking progress in <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71"
                                facs="0101"/>this field, but seemed to show a realization of the

                        <p>Germany. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> asked me if I had read recent
                                <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> declaration on Germany,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d32fn5">Not further identified.</note> and I said that
                            I had and that I did not find it [at] all surprising in view of the
                            position they had taken at both Geneva conferences. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then said he hoped that the
                            West understood very clearly that they were “not in a position” to make
                            any deal behind the backs and at the expense of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>, and that they could not and would not
                            go along that path. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            said that the West German Government did not seem to realize this fact
                            which had been the reason for the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>
                            announcement, and he expressed the view that Von Brentano was largely
                            responsible since he had found <persName corresp="#p_AK1"
                                >Adenauer</persName> “more realistic” during their Moscow visit.
                            Both repeated that the only road to unification was by direct dealings
                            between the two Germanys.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought this provided no solution whatsoever and would merely
                            legalize and perpetuate division of Germany, and until German unity was
                            achieved in accordance with the freely expressed wish of the German
                            people there could be no real tranquility or security in Europe. Neither
                            disagreed with this statement but merely repeated that they would not
                            sell out East German regime for any consideration and that this fact
                            must be faced.</p>
                        <p>I gained the distinct impression that the Soviet leaders themselves had
                            no clear policy for the future in regard to German unification and had
                            gotten themselves into position where they had very little room for
                            maneuver, and their problem of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>
                            set-up was chief obstacle. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> at one point said strategically Soviet Union
                            had little interest in, what he rather contemptuously described as, 17
                            million Germans but that matter of <gloss target="#t_DDR1">DDR</gloss>
                            was a “political” question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> made to me last evening
                            what I regard as one of the best expressions of Russian Bolshevik
                            mentality when in discussing Soviet American relations he said “You

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence explained that he would like first
                            to discuss the dramatic news from Moscow. The plain attempt to blast
                            STALIN to pieces had raised a number of interesting problems. Someone
                            had suggested, indeed, that <persName>Joseph</persName> STALIN had now
                            become “the Trojan corpse” which was to be introduced inside the
                            defenses of the free world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then went on to describe the alleged now
                            famous final meeting at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist
                            Party. Foreign Delegates had been excluded from this meeting at which
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> so violently
                            criticized STALIN. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> believed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s purpose at this
                            meeting was to provide guidance to the Soviet delegates present on how
                            to deal henceforth with the STALIN myth or saga. No one knew precisely
                            what had transpired at this meeting, but Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            said that the following was his own guess. It seemed quite likely that
                            as <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was proceeding to
                            read the directives downgrading STALIN, questions were put to him from
                            the floor which he had undertaken to answer extemporaneously. While this
                            might account for some of the drama, it was also apparent that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had deliberately undertaken
                            in his speech to destroy STALIN, because he had cited chapter and verse
                            on all of STALIN’s crimes. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then
                            proceeded to summarize the alleged contents of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech. Thereafter he
                            noted that while nothing had yet appeared in the Soviet press with
                            respect to this now famous occasion, a great many newspaper people in
                            the Soviet Union had managed to pick up bits and pieces of what had
                            happened. The fact that there had been no official denial of these
                            newspaper stories, and the fact that the USSR was permitting these
                            stories to get by the censors, would seem to indicate the basic truth of
                            the allegation that the attack on STALIN had taken place.</p>
                        <p>As in the case of what had occurred at this meeting, so likewise with the
                            repercussions in Georgia.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">The anniversary of
                                STALIN’s death, March 5, passed unnoticed in the Soviet Union. On
                                March 7, student demonstrations, whose purpose was unknown, took
                                place in Tiflis, the capital of the Georgian Republic. There were
                                unconfirmed reports that Soviet troops or police fired on the
                                demonstrators on March 8. A brief chronology of the developments in
                                Georgia was attached to a memorandum of March 19 from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> through <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> to the Acting Secretary, in
                                which <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> concluded that
                                there was “no information to indicate that the reported
                                demonstrations in Georgia are serious or that the situation is not
                                fully under control.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                761.00/3–1956)</note> It was hard to distinguish between fact and
                            rumor. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then gave a general account of
                            the student riots in Tiflis. It seemed particularly significant to him
                            that the uprising in Tiflis went so far that the Soviet Government <pb
                                n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0104"/>had been obliged to relax some of
                            its major anti-Stalinist measures in Georgia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> next directed attention to the question
                            as to why the rulers of the Soviet Union had decided to attack STALIN’s
                            reputation in this particular way and at this particular time. This was
                            a puzzling problem. One explanation, of course, was the Communist
                            penchant for self-criticism. Another explanation perhaps lay in the hope
                            of the Soviet leaders to gain respectability aboard by virtue of a
                            complete break with the past. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> expressed
                            skepticism as to whether this latter objective would be attained,
                            although he admitted that it might have some effect on the Socialist
                            parties throughout the world. Another possibility was that the Soviet
                            leaders had permitted themselves to be pushed further than they had
                            initially intended to go, thanks to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s exuberant personality. There was always the
                            possibility, of course, that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had been drunk. Nevertheless, it was
                            significant that there was as yet no visible tendency to reverse the
                            trend in the direction of destroying STALIN’s influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then commented that these events afforded
                            the United States a great opportunity, both covertly and overtly, to
                            exploit the situation to its advantage. STALIN had been the chief
                            theoretician of the Soviet Union. He had been its great war hero in
                            addition to his more familiar role as Dictator of the Soviet Union for
                            twenty-five years. What would the Soviets now do with all the vast
                            accumulation of STALIN’s printed works? It would take years to rid
                            libraries and individuals of these volumes. There was also the problem
                            occasioned by the fact that STALIN’s detractors had all worked closely
                            with him over a long period of years. It would obviously be very
                            difficult to create a new tradition. There was the problem of STALIN’s
                            policies which, if any of these, would now be repudiated. Finally, what
                            would the leadership in the satellite states now do? These men were
                            almost all the creatures of STALIN.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested that all of
                            these problems had important policy implications for the United States.
                            Accordingly, they should be most carefully considered. In Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ opinion, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and the other leaders had been guilty of a
                            most serious mistake.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed agreement with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                            judgment. He gave it as his personal belief that when the Soviet leaders
                            decided to adopt the new tactics and approach with which we are now
                            familiar, they had felt themselves obliged to repudiate STALIN. After
                            all, said the President, the Soviets could not make people like Nehru
                            believe, at one and the same time, in the sincerity of the new Soviet
                            tactics and in the validity of the Stalinist line and tactics.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            Communism could not be held together without a doctrine. In this belief
                            STALIN was correct. While <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"/>the
                            present Soviet leaders could rid themselves of STALIN’s books and
                            STALIN’s doctrine, they would have to find a substitute. Both the
                            President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            suggested that the substitute was already at hand in the writings of
                            Lenin. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed,
                            but pointed out that there was no handbook of Leninism. Lenin’s writings
                            encompassed ten large volumes. It was going to be very difficult to
                            decide what to pick out of these volumes and summarize in a
                            handbook.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he had
                            one question to put. Was there any likelihood that what had happened in
                            the Soviet Union would turn out favorably for the United States? The
                            President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            answered that they thought that these events would be definitely
                            advantageous for the United States.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE DESECRATION OF STALIN</p>
                        <p>The public desecration of STALIN by his successors constitutes a major
                            psychological jolt whose ultimate repercussions on the Soviet population
                            and Communists abroad cannot yet be foreseen.</p>
                        <p>Initial reports from both inside and outside the Soviet Union reveal that
                            the attack on STALIN has produced disbelief, uncertainty, confusion,
                            embarrassment, and anger.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Hazards Ahead.</hi> The Soviet rulers certainly
                            realized that by publicly attacking STALIN they would create for
                            themselves certain risks. Because they would hardly attempt political
                            suicide, they presumably calculated that they could successfully cope
                            with these hazards, which they may have unduly discounted.</p>
                        <p>The main risk was an intangible one: the psychological effect on Party
                            members at home and abroad. For years millions within the USSR and
                            abroad have been encouraged to believe in the wisdom of <pb n="76"
                                xml:id="pg_76" facs="0106"/>a demi-god and the consequent
                            correctness of all Soviet methods and policies. About half of the
                            present Soviet population has been born since 1929 when the cult of
                            STALIN-worship began. Communist parties abroad attained their largest
                            growth during the post-war period when STALIN-worship reached its
                            all-time high.</p>
                        <p>The sudden effort to eradicate a quarter century of indoctrination that
                            Communist loyalties should be directed toward the symbol of STALIN would
                            require many Communists to make a deep personal readjustment. For years
                            they had either uncritically accepted all things STALIN or disciplined
                            themselves to suppress private doubts that Moscow has now publicly
                            expressed. The Soviet rulers presumably count on intensive
                            indoctrination, and the habit of compliance to lubricate the process of
                            readjustment, but the speed with which the Communist rank-and-file can
                            reorient itself after such a psychological jolt remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet rulers will need to set up guideposts to clarify the new path
                            for the Party line. Pressures to resist the line and pressures to exceed
                            it will have to be checked at all levels. The license to criticize
                            STALIN cannot be allowed to become a permit to question basic Soviet
                            policies, or the legitimacy of the current rulers, or their role in
                            aiding STALIN’s rise and his mistakes. The rewriting of 36 years of
                            Soviet history and the actual rehabilitation of some of STALIN’s victims
                            will have to be controlled by countless decisions that may ultimately
                            touch on all facets of Soviet life.</p>
                        <p>Evidently the Soviet rulers are willing to accept the consequences of a
                            period of confusion and uncertainty. They presumably calculate that
                            their machinery for persuasion and coercion will enable them to keep
                            within limits the negative repercussions and in time will ensure support
                            for the new line. The very act of initiating criticism of STALIN appears
                            to indicate that the Soviet ruling group views its own position with
                            confidence. The absence of various Soviet rulers from the USSR during
                            the reported demonstrations in Georgia, apparently touched off by the
                            attack on STALIN, further points toward assuredness among the ruling
                            group.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Moving with Caution.</hi> Meanwhile, they appear to be
                            unfolding their campaign against STALIN with some degree of caution.</p>
                        <p>The present leadership had begun to shrink STALIN’s symbol almost
                            immediately after his death by withholding adulation from him and
                            concentrating it instead on Lenin. This treatment of STALIN during the
                            three years leading up to the Party Congress suggests that at least a
                            substantial portion within the ruling group, if not all, agreed that he
                            should be cut down in size.</p>
                        <p>Whether this shrinking process was also part of a premeditated program
                            leading up to an open attack on him at the Congress is open to question.
                            The treatment of STALIN fluctuated during this <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                                facs="0107"/>period. Although reduced in stature, he remained a
                            positive symbol. His birthday anniversary in December received unusual
                            attention and as late as January he was accorded favorable treatment.
                            Had the Soviet rulers been pursuing a fully agreed program, it is
                            possible that they would have sought to condition the Party and the
                            population for the shock of public criticism of STALIN. The suddenness
                            of the switch from passively withholding praise of STALIN to actively
                            assailing him and the variations in the treatment of this issue by
                            various speakers at the Congress suggest that the ruling group may have
                            been divided on how far to go and may have reached a decision only
                            shortly before the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Even at the Congress, they moved with care. In the published speeches
                            they avoided criticizing STALIN by name, except once, although he was
                            the unmistakable target for their attack. The detailed indictment was
                            reserved for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech
                            at a closed session on the last day of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>It is understandable why the Soviet rulers preferred to reserve their
                            main attack for a closed meeting. Yet the possibility cannot be
                            completely excluded that they had not intended to go beyond the charges
                            made publicly, but that in view of the mixed reactions to these charges
                            they felt it necessary to justify their attack by revealing a more
                            detailed indictment.</p>
                        <p>Since the Congress they have continued to move gradually. A month after
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s secret speech
                            the Soviet press had yet even to mention the fact of its delivery.
                            Soviet censors had allowed foreign correspondents to refer to it since
                            March 17, but criticism of STALIN by foreign Communists has been deleted
                            from reports of their speeches in the Soviet press.</p>
                        <p>For the first month after the Congress the indoctrination of the Party
                            rank-and-file and apparently some non-Party persons has been confined to
                            an oral basis. Party leaders and agitators have addressed meetings
                            throughout the Soviet Union, presumably revealing the contents of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s secret speech or
                            a reported secret circular from the Central Committee based on the
                            speech. A British Communist correspondent in Moscow estimates 30 million
                            Soviet citizens will have attended these meetings. Given the rapidity of
                            rumors within the Soviet Union, a large share of the population can now
                            be assumed to have heard of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s indictment of STALIN.</p>
                        <p>While the oral indoctrination continues, the Soviet press broke its
                            silence on March 28 when <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> published a
                            commentary denouncing some of the evils of STALIN’s rule. <hi
                                rend="italic">Kommunist,</hi> the Party’s theoretical journal, and
                                <hi rend="italic">Red Star,</hi> Army organ, followed with critical
                            articles. The <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> piece centered on the point
                            that it was absurd, even superstitious, to imagine that Soviet successes
                            are the work of <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0108"/>only one man.
                            Rather it is the people, led by the Party, who make history.</p>
                        <p>The commentary appeared to be only a partial paraphrase of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reported speech. It did
                            not go as far as the charges already revealed in the published speeches
                            of the Congress and it ignored various charges made by satellite

                            delicate a topic <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> did confirm that a
                            large-scale “explanatory campaign” was under way and would purposely
                            avoid a rapid pace because of the vastness and difficulty of the task at
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the regime has indicated the new attitude toward STALIN by
                            removing some, not all, pictures and statues of him from various public
                            places. The Soviet radio is said to have stopped broadcasting the lyrics
                            of the national anthem, which includes a favorable reference to STALIN.
                            The name of the large STALIN Automobile Works in Moscow is reported to
                            have been changed to Moscow Automobile Works. New history books are said
                            to be in preparation. At least one prominent victim of STALIN’s purges
                            has been seen in Moscow after nearly 20 years in prison, and others are
                            reported to have been rehabilitated. There are rumors that petitions are
                            being circulated demanding the removal of STALIN’s body from the Red
                            Square mausoleum. How far the regime intends to go in displacing public
                            symbols of STALIN is yet to be revealed. It should be noted that STALIN
                            peace prizes were awarded to foreigners in mid-March.</p>

                            charges appeared in the Yugoslav newspaper <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi>
                            on March 20, and these were described as still incomplete.</p>
                        <p>Apparently STALIN’s activities generally before 1934 are to be favorably
                            regarded. He was hailed by <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> for his role in
                            the Soviet civil war, for opposing Trotsky, his role in building
                            socialism. Foreign Communists also praised him for undertaking the
                            collectivization of agriculture and for launching the program of forced
                            industrialization. One line common to foreign Communists is to hail the
                            “great victories” achieved during STALIN’s time, but to admit that “they
                            may have cost more than was necessary.”</p>
                        <p>After the early ’thirties he is said to have “gradually” placed himself
                            above Party and state and instituted one-man rule during which he made a
                            number of errors and committed various excesses. In particular, his

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi> article spelled out these charges in
                            greater details. It alleged that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> accused a “morbidly suspicious” STALIN of
                            conducting a reign of terror over his associates as well as the
                            population at large, ordering the death of Voznesensky, instituting the
                            “doctors’ plot,” and committing other crimes. Pending clarification from
                            Soviet sources, there is no way to judge the accuracy of these press
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>Although the Soviet rulers have indicated that they do not intend to
                            repudiate STALIN completely, they may find it difficult to preserve
                            STALIN’s earlier merits once his reported excesses become widely

                        <p>While these effects doubtless reflect varying factors in the Soviet
                            decision, they do not seem in themselves to provide a satisfactory
                            explanation for the Soviet rulers’ action. Much the same effect could
                            have been achieved by simply letting STALIN be increasingly ignored. The
                            conclusion seems inescapable, therefore, that the Soviet rulers
                            deliberately wanted to make a spectacular impact such as the public
                            denunciation of STALIN would produce. (<persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                                >Togliatti</persName> is reported to have said that the Soviet
                            rulers told him that the Soviet party needed a severe and sudden
                            shock.)</p>
                        <p>Did the Soviet rulers feel compelled to go to this extreme, or did they
                            elect the action of their own free will? There is little evidence that
                            they considered themselves under any immediate compulsion. Certainly the
                            current international situation contained no pressure for them to
                            dissociate themselves publicly from STALIN’s methods. The domestic
                            situation is obviously less well known, but present evidence does not
                            indicate that any internal pressures compelled them to defame STALIN.
                            Suggestions that the Soviet military had forced them to attack STALIN
                            accords the armed forces an independent political role in no way
                            supported by available evidence.</p>
                        <p>Clearly the Soviet rulers face various domestic problems, but they have
                            given no indication of weakness in their will to cope with them. Indeed
                            in the critical field of agriculture, they demonstrated increased
                            confidence in the stability of their rule by initiating, after the Party
                            Congress, renewed pressure against the peasants.</p>
                        <p>Increasingly during their three years of rule, the new rulers have
                            demonstrated their own approach to some of these problems. They have
                            brought about a general relaxation in the atmosphere of tension that
                            clouded STALIN’s last years. They have shown an awareness of the need of
                            Soviet elite groups for a feeling of greater personal security: to be
                            able to carry out their work without the threat of police terror. They
                            have succeeded in ending one-man control of the police and thus reducing
                            the threat of capricious coercion. They have sought to decentralize
                            certain governmental and economic functions, distributing greater
                            responsibility to the lower levels and to units outside of Moscow. At
                            the same time, however, they have maintained an undiluted monopoly of
                            political power, reserving to themselves the prerogative of final
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>In essence, they have attempted to operate a totalitarian state without a
                            single dictator and to reduce the paralyzing sanctions of STALIN’s
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>If less reliance is to be placed on coercion, threatened and real, then
                            other means of inducing the population to perform satisfactorily rise in
                            importance. In a system where coercion plays a strong role, <pb n="81"
                                xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>those below are expected simply to obey;
                            they have little positive feeling of participation and are fearful of
                            accepting responsibility.</p>
                        <p>During STALIN’s era the regime sought to persuade as well as to coerce,
                            and repeatedly called for measures to raise “inner-Party democracy,”
                            increase the activity and initiative of the Party rank-and-file, abolish
                            a formalistic execution of decisions. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> at the Nineteenth Party Congress especially
                            emphasized the need for self-criticism and criticism from below, but
                            revealed the ineffectiveness of such appeals when he admitted that some
                            who had taken this course had suffered persecution and reprisals.
                            Exhortations to greater effort apparently could not overcome the
                            stagnation produced by fear and apathy.</p>
                        <p>The post-STALIN regime has similarly sought to revitalize the Party and
                            to attract a more positive response from both elite groups and the
                            population at large. The acceptance of responsibility and the exercise
                            of initiative does not, however, come easy after years of experience in
                            the penalties for failure, real and alleged. If the post-STALIN regime
                            was to avoid a return to a greater reliance on coercion, it would have
                            to convince the lower ranks of its seriousness in encouraging greater
                            activity at their level and reassure them that such activity would not
                            lead necessarily to personal jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>In such a context, the attack on STALIN can be viewed as a deliberate
                            effort to stimulate the Party and the population by shock-treatment.
                            Denunciation of terrorism would be expected to be received by the
                            population, especially the elite, as a reassurance and to be answered by
                            them with a more creative and enthusiastic approach to their work.</p>
                        <p>The regime might have been able to produce such a response by focusing
                            the Soviet economic effort on raising the standard of living. Under the
                            Sixth Five Year Plan, however, the Soviet worker is again being called
                            upon to raise the productive capacity of the USSR. The goal of catching
                            up with and surpassing the US economic output refers to heavy rather
                            than light industry and thus offers little prospect for an early
                            substantial rise in the Soviet general standard of living. Unwilling to
                            divert resources for increased consumers’ goods as a stimulant to the
                            Soviet worker, the regime has apparently sought to spur him on with
                            psychological inducements.</p>
                        <p>What response will be finally forthcoming from the Soviet population can
                            only be surmised at this time. Although the Soviet regime appears to be
                            urging the removal of certain inhibitions, its followers can be expected
                            to move cautiously in testing any new ground.</p>
                        <p>The defamation of STALIN can also be regarded as a logical extension of
                            current Soviet foreign policy efforts to appear respectable and to win
                            support abroad. At the national level, local Communist <pb n="82"
                                xml:id="pg_82" facs="0112"/>parties will have to surmount their
                            embarrassment, but in time may find themselves in a stronger position to
                            claim that they are independent and to appeal to other leftist groups to
                            establish popular fronts. It has been suggested that the attack on
                            STALIN cannot but have an effect on the relationship between Moscow and
                            parties within and outside the Communist bloc. The bloc parties face the
                            same general problems on this subject as in the Soviet Union itself. In
                            some cases, doubt may be thrown on the status of Communist leaders who
                            have long been identified with STALIN or who occupy STALIN-like
                            positions. Outside the bloc Communist Party members have raised publicly
                            questions about the permissibility of criticizing the Soviet Union and
                            of relying more heavily on their own evaluations particularly of local
                            situations. How far Moscow will permit such questioning and to what
                            extent it will insist on a common international Communist line remains
                            to be seen.</p>

                        <p>Presumably would be best if we are able to defer official comments until
                            Soviet actions provide surer guide to meaning of 20th Party Congress and
                            of de-Stalinization movement, but presume comment unavoidable if press
                            raises issue. Objective then would presumably be to have best impact on
                            those areas at moment most critical to our interests, as we do not
                            believe it feasible to formulate comments which would have universally
                            favorable impact.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0113"/>
                        <p>It is also desirable comments provide minimum opportunity to Soviets for
                            distortion as counter-propaganda.</p>
                        <p>In Asia and Middle East there appears willingness even anxiety to believe
                            that the new Moscow lines indicate a basic reorientation of Soviet
                            policy having as objective a lessening of tensions which will make it
                            easier for newly sovereign populations to pursue development of their
                            economies in peace. These peoples must also recognize that Soviet offers
                            of assistance give them the opportunity to bargain. Probably the
                            Yugoslav interpretation of events is similar although much deeper since
                            it evidently stems from a conviction the principles that Tito has been
                            enunciating are vindicated by Soviet emulation. Therefore, if it is
                            Asians (and Yugoslavs) whom we particularly want to impress at this
                            time, we would suggest that the statement give particular emphasis to
                            what might be called “promising” elements in the current developments.
                            We also believe that “denouncing STALIN” is of secondary importance;
                            such denouncement seems to have been necessary (although the reasons may
                            be obscure) in order to give emphasis and meaning to the line that has
                            been developing for some time of so-called revolutionary legality.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we would hesitate to give the impression to the Asians that we
                            rebuff without waiting to test the sincerity of the Soviet leadership in
                            their offers of cooperation, negotiation and aid which have certainly
                            impressed the Indians, Burmese and Arabs.</p>
                        <p>If it is considered desirable to retain the enumeration of deeds which
                            the Soviets could perform as proof it would seem important to include
                            disarmament in the third paragraph. We are somewhat dubious, however,
                            about the desirability of including the Japanese since it is quite
                            conceivable that the Soviets, having set up inflated bargaining
                            positions, may be preparing in the relatively near future to make some
                            “concessions” which the Japanese would find difficult to turn down at
                            the price of normalization of relations. Also, although from our point
                            of view Soviet activity in the Middle East is increasing tensions, we
                            wonder whether our referring to the matter, at least until after
                            Hammarskjold has completed proposed mission, would have a useful effect
                            on the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>If we wish to concentrate on Europeans it should be useful to point out
                            that although Soviet leadership may be responding in part to the
                            aspirations of Soviet citizens long submerged by the repression
                            characteristic of the STALIN style of government, nevertheless what that
                            leadership now gives, it does so unilaterally and in no way surrenders
                            the right to take away again although barring major domestic or foreign
                            crisis, it would appear difficult for them to return overnight to
                            Stalinist methods. The prerogatives STALIN monopolized have been
                            somewhat dispersed, but not dissipated, among the new governors; and if
                            there is at present a closer identification <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"
                                facs="0114"/>between the interests of the regime and the aspirations
                            of Soviet citizens, with consequent effect upon the method with which
                            the regime operates, there has been no renouncement of objectives. What
                            seems to have happened is that the regime’s conviction that communism
                            will ultimately prevail by operation of historical forces, barring
                            nuclear warfare, has grown deeper and its greater self-assurance permits
                            it a more relaxed method of rule and allows it to concede greater
                            self-determination to satellites and Communist parties abroad.</p>
                        <p>Although the new posture may in the short run cause waverers in Western
                            Europe to waver more and permit intellectuals etc. who found it
                            difficult to stomach STALIN to satisfy their nostalgia for Lenin and
                            therefore to regard the Soviet Union with additional sympathy, we concur
                            fully with draft statement to effect that these and possibly other
                            foreign repercussions have, in the light of circumstantial evidence so
                            far available, played secondary part in the formulation by Soviet
                            leaders of the present line. As statement implies, internal
                            developments, e.g. the system although beset by serious, although not
                            critical problems, has held together and operated successfully without
                            the all powerful hand of STALIN; vested interests, professional and
                            economic, have contributed to regime’s stability.</p>
                        <p>Soviet people have long frustrated aspirations, seem to have been
                            decisive in bringing the regime to its present conclusions and postures
                                [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Cutting across all of this is sobering
                            effect of honest estimate of the nuclear equation (difficult for STALIN
                            to reconcile with principles of infallibility and vulnerability).</p>
                        <p>In sum we would heartily agree that none more than the United States
                            would welcome such changes provided they have cumulative favorable
                            effect upon Soviet conduct of its relations with other countries.</p>

                            speech. By dividing the STALIN era into good and bad periods it tried to
                            create as smooth a possible transition to <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86"

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi> editorial fails to credit STALIN with
                            any “good period”. It refers to <persName corresp="#p_BNA1"

                            perhaps indicating they are the ones the Yugoslavs primarily look to as
                            against other leaders who may hold different views.</p>
                        <p>There has been a different tempo of acceptance of the new line by the
                            communist parties outside of Russia. This has occurred faster in the
                            parties in Poland and East Germany.</p>

                        <p>For the time being US <hi rend="italic">overt</hi> propaganda should
                            continue to be pitched on a minor key. The anti-STALIN campaign is
                            following its own course, very much to our advantage. If the communists
                            could show that the US was gloating over their present embarrassment,
                            they might be able to close ranks and also discredit the US with some
                            Socialist elements who would dislike a sensational “capitalist”
                            victory.</p>
                        <p>While continuing to promote the destruction of communist credibility, as
                            provided in general guidance, US media should endeavor to delay as long
                            as possible the closing of the gap between the new communist line and
                            the old.</p>
                        <p>US media can point out the inconsistency between the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi> editorials,
                            emphasizing the former did not tell the whole story.</p>
                        <p>Doubt and criticism can also be stimulated by asking hypothetical
                            questions of a kind probably in the minds of many communists.</p>
                        <p>Opportunities for creating confusion within foreign communist parties,
                            and particularly in France and Italy, should be exploited by indirect
                            means, as is now being done, rather than by direct US intervention,
                            which would be counter-productive.</p>

                                Dulles</persName> made the following comments during his briefing on

                                    on the campaign to downgrade STALIN, which he said was
                                    continuing briskly. He referred to editorials published in <hi

                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> speculated that, thanks to the
                                    play in the foreign press, the anti-STALIN campaign was
                                    receiving more impetus than its instigators had originally
                                    intended it to have.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that only yesterday had the
                                    Chinese Communists finally made known their views on the
                                    anti-STALIN campaign, in the <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1"
                                        >shape</gloss> of a long statement which had reached us last
                                    night. It was evident from this statement that the Chinese
                                    Communists were in some difficulty because they do not fully
                                    accept the new Soviet insistence on collective leadership.
                                    Incidentally, said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, he
                                    personally believed that the Soviet leaders had their tongues in
                                    their cheeks when they professed to believe in the practice of
                                    collective leadership.</p>
                                <p>“At this point Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to comment
                                    on the various satellite reactions to the downgrading of STALIN,
                                    to the wholesale rehabilitation of individuals who had been
                                    purged, and finally to point out that in some of the satellites
                                    political difficulties were bound to emerge from this
                                    campaign.</p>

                            <item>Where STALIN is himself criticized in current line, it is because
                                of specific errors attributed to him, errors which it is implied
                                party, had it been able, would not have permitted. These errors were
                                serious primarily in sense they diverted or slowed progress of
                                Soviet Union or increased risks to it. STALIN’s “constructive”

                                its effects must be felt down lines of command; in Soviet

                                with countries of rest of world. This is less a calculated effect
                                than psychological one, but even so it is extremely important one to
                                recognize since it does not in any way represent lessened hostility
                                toward United States and “reactionary” societies. Conviction of
                                leadership here in “rightness”, strength and stability of system and
                                in Marxist theory of history is no weaker, and is probably stronger.
                                Willingness to “compete” in so-called peaceful co-existence starts
                                from borders outward, never inward, of expanded empire inherited

                                progressive elements in West who were unable to stomach Stalinist

                        <p>Party leadership can reasonably be expected to achieve some success
                            toward these goals. Its effect on certain segments of population
                            non-Communist world, coupled with flexible foreign policy and deft
                            manipulation propaganda symbols, should help USSR in its world
                            diplomacy. Within Soviet Union, campaign should appeal among key groups
                            mentioned above, not only because STALIN deflated but (perhaps more
                            important) because it makes more convincing assertions Soviet leaders
                            that police terror as it existed under STALIN is thing of past.
                            Additionally, campaign will probably create atmosphere conducive to more
                            realistic discussion of internal economic and social problems and may
                            stimulate—as intended—greater local initiative. Finally,
                            psychological-ideological barrier to reestablishment personal
                            dictatorship raised by campaign must be regarded as one of its most
                            significant substantive results.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, campaign poses certain real and potential problems for

                            their impact and this aspect must be approached with great caution.

                        <p>1. It is believed that you and certain other Agency officials will be
                            interested in the hypothesis, set forth below, of one of the most
                            outstanding American experts on Soviet affairs, which I have just
                            received. For the reasons which I have expressed orally to you, I do not
                            deem it advisable to identify this expert in this memorandum. … It is my
                            hope that a certain amount of additional research, keyed to the various
                            points that are advanced in support of this hypothesis, will be
                            productive of material tending to support or disprove at least some
                            portions of the analysis, thereby affording to us a somewhat clearer
                            view of the matter. I would recommend against the dissemination of this
                            document outside the Agency until such time as it has been subjected to
                            further research and analysis.</p>
                        <p>2. The expert takes exception to the view which has been expressed in
                            certain quarters that the present Soviet leadership is a <pb n="97"
                                xml:id="pg_97" facs="0127"/>group of amiable and mutually cordial
                            persons, welded together by their long apprenticeship under STALIN who
                            have found a workable and enduring solution to the inherent difficulties
                            of collective leadership. In particular this expert is skeptical of the
                            view that the recent wave of anti-STALIN revelations in Russia
                            represents only the implementation of a plan conceived long in advance,
                            and quite harmoniously, by the entire group at the top. [The foregoing
                            is perhaps an over-simplification of the line of thought to which
                            exception is taken—but it is set up in this manner by the expert to
                            provide a clear point of departure for his analysis. Actually I am not
                            aware that any of the respectable experts consider that there is <hi
                                rend="italic">complete</hi> harmony within the top leadership, since
                            most of those who are inclined to the view that barring unforeseen
                            crises we can expect a substantial period of mutual accommodation as
                            between the leaders have qualified their statements in various ways and
                            in varying degrees.]<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">Brackets in the source

                        <p>3. The hypothesis which appears to this expert the most plausible and
                            most worthy of attention with respect to these recent happenings in
                            Russia is simply this: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“That the members of the present leading group either killed
                                    STALIN, in 1953, or brought about his death as a side-effect of
                                    an effort to remove him from power;</p>
                                <p>“That they did not wish to admit this at the time for fear of

                                <p>“That they have been aware from the start that some day and in

                                <p>“That this has been the basic reason for the entire action, since
                                    STALIN’s death, to reduce his stature in the public eye; that
                                    these men have been concerned, in other words, to
                                    reveal—gradually and discreetly—the true frightfulness of
                                    STALIN’s personality in order that when the truth does come out
                                    their action may appear as a justifiable step to save the
                                    movement from possible destruction at the hands of a semi-mad
                                    villain rather than as an act of treachery and jealousy;</p>
                                <p>“That the secret thus shared by these men is indeed in some
                                    respects a bond of unity among them, but at the same time a very
                                    touchy and delicate factor in their relations and one that can
                                    easily be or become, the source of violent suspicions and

                                    fast the debunking of STALIN ought, in the interests of the
                                    movement, to be permitted to proceed but threats or insistence,
                                    from some quarter, that the revelation of what occurred in 1953
                                    may—or should—take place in the near future.”</p>

                        <p>The expert adds that if his hypothesis is generally accurate, then there
                            would be every reason to suppose that the killing of Beria (who would
                            not—in this expert’s opinion—be accepted as a party to the action
                            against STALIN) had something to do with knowledge on Beria’s part of
                            what had occurred and of the fact that he could not be depended on—not
                            sharing the guilt—to observe the same rules and to have the same sense
                            of responsibility in this respect, as the others.</p>
                        <p>This expert also doubts very much that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> was a party to any of this, which would explain
                            his estrangement from the ruling group; but his cautious temperament
                            plus perhaps the fact that he has no actual proof, might be considered
                            sufficient guarantee, in contrast to Beria, that he will make no
                            trouble. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>, too, cannot
                            have been a full-fledged participant in the action against STALIN, a
                            circumstance that would explain much in the development of his position
                            since STALIN’s death, and may be very important for his political future
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>4. This expert emphasizes that the foregoing is only a hypothesis, but
                            states that he has been encouraged to give it to us by what seems to him
                            to be some general confirmation, in subsequent events of the
                            interpretation of Soviet internal happenings which he gave to us shortly
                            after the death of Stalin.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> This analysis and hypothesis is quite
                            similar in certain respects to that which appeared in the 16 April issue
                            of the <hi rend="italic">New Leader,</hi> in an article by Vishniak,
                            entitled “Was STALIN Murdered?” The Vishniak article contains references
                            to other authors said to hold similar views (e.g., Nicolaevsky,
                            Borkenau, Crankshaw, Joseph Newman, Gouzenko). It may well develop that
                            the processs of normal research will not produce any very clear-cut
                            results, by way of affirming or disproving the thesis. … The fact that a
                            serious and knowledgeable expert can arrive at such an hypothesis
                            suggests that it may be a very credible one.…</p>

                                    report dated May 17. He said he felt these were important
                                    considerations which would permit the undermining and
                                    discrediting of current Soviet propaganda lines and suggested
                                    that they should receive major emphasis in media output. There
                                    were no other comments on the status report. Mr. <persName

                                    opinion that it was important that a high level group continue
                                    active in this field and suggested that the present Special

                        <p>7. A distinction is being made between the U.S. official line and other
                            U.S. means to exploit the campaign.</p>
                        <p>8. Publicly, U.S. media are adopting a note of cautious skepticism,
                            calling upon the Soviet leaders to demonstrate their professed
                            attachment to reform by correcting still outstanding major abuses in
                            domestic and foreign politics. For the time being, an attitude of
                            jubilation over communist embarrassment is being avoided in order to
                            obviate a counter-productive reaction which might cause the communists
                            to close their ranks. In order to stimulate and maintain the momentum of
                            the effects of the campaign without directly involving the U.S., overt
                            media are helping to keep in circulation the flow of material and
                            comment, wherever generated, damaging to the communist cause.</p>
                        <p>9. In the non-attributable field the U.S. is employing its resources to
                            sow confusion and doubt in the communist world, to undermine the
                            objectives of the campaign through ridicule and questioning and to
                            expose the attempt of the present leaders to dissociate themselves from
                            unpopular communist tenets.</p>
                        <p>10. It is appreciated that an excellent opportunity is presented to
                            exploit the contradictions of communism and this is being done wherever
                            possible by direct statement, by implication or suggestion as
                            appropriate to each particular form of media.</p>

                                Central Files, 761.00/5–1956)<p>In his memoirs, Ray Cline, who was
                                    then the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s expert on
                                    Sino-Soviet relations, recalled that the agency obtained a copy
                                    of the speech in April “through non-American intermediaries, at
                                    a very handsome price.” Cline, who was asked to read the
                                    document to vouch for its authenticity, argued that it was
                                    authentic and that it should be made public as an aid to
                                    students and scholars interested in the Soviet Union. Cline said
                                    that he had also pointed out that it was a rare opportunity to
                                    have all the critical things that “we had said for years about
                                    the Soviet dictatorship confirmed by the principal leader of the
                                    Soviet Politburo.” But, according to Cline, <persName

                                    Chief of Counterintelligence and Counterespionage, opposed
                                    publication of the speech and wanted to “exploit” it by “feeding
                                    selected bits of the text to specific audiences on which they
                                    wanted to have an impact.” (Cline, <hi rend="italic">Secrets,

                        <p>The President indicated he had wanted to have this meeting in order to
                            see just what we are doing, and how we are handling the matter of
                            special reconnaissance flights. He referred to a recent protest by the
                            USSR. <note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">The text of the Soviet note, May 14,
                                was transmitted to the Embassy in Moscow in telegram 1273, May 15.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 761.5411/ 5–1456)</note> He
                            said he wanted to give the Soviets every chance to move in peaceful
                            directions and to put our relations on a better basis—and to see how far
                            they will go. For this reason, during this period, it is particularly
                            desirable to be wise and careful in what <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106"
                                facs="0136"/>we do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> read the draft text of a reply to the Soviets.

                                29 the Department of State presented to the Soviet Embassy a note
                                explaining that navigational difficulties in the Arctic region may
                                have caused unintentional violations of Soviet air space, which, if
                                they in fact had occurred, the Department regretted. The text of the
                                note was transmitted in telegram 1332 to Moscow, May 29. (<hi

                            might be added to the effect that our Government had instructed its
                            aviation services to be especially careful in this regard (possibility
                            of navigational error in Arctic regions).</p>
                        <p>Turning then to a discussion of the Soviet invitation to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d47fn4">See <ref target="#d105">Document 105</ref>.</note>
                            the President said he had wondered why they picked out one Chief, rather
                            than the JCS as a whole, since they function as a body—specifically he
                            wondered whether they did so for personal reasons or with some other
                            purpose in mind. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>
                            said that the invitation was for Soviet Aviation Day, and that they were
                            inviting air officers of many other countries. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> recalled that at Geneva
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had said
                            laughingly that the Soviets might send their chiefs over to look at U.S.
                            war plans, and that he had said that might be all right if it were
                            fifty-fifty. He added that the JCS had considered the matter and were
                            disposed to accept an invitation if extended, indicating that they would
                            want to look seriously at what the Soviets have.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> wanted to go, he saw no reason why he should
                            not. He would not foresee that the visit would be of any particular
                            intelligence value, however. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> said there was a good possibility that he might
                            go in the Boeing 707, flying non-stop from the United States to Moscow.
                            The President (and the others present) thought this was a splendid
                                <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> if it could be worked. The
                            President said that General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> could say while he was there that if the Soviets
                            want to trade military visits, and go around and really see what the
                            other country has in a military sense, they might invite our Chiefs, who
                            would be prepared to visit the Soviet Union providing the Soviets were
                            willing to have their chiefs visit us.</p>
                        <p>The President next discussed certain other reconnaissance efforts.</p>
                        <p>He then returned to the subject of the invitation to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> and indicated he thought it
                            should not have come directly to the Air Force, but should have come
                            through diplomatic channels, inasmuch as the Soviet Embassy is
                            accredited to the President. He indicated that he thought an answer
                            ought to go to the Soviets through the American Ambassador to the effect
                            that the Chief of Staff of the Air Force is authorized to attend, and
                            that he will <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0137"/>provide his own
                            transport. All things considered, he felt it was best for General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> to go.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated that he is very anxious to see how far the Soviets
                            are ready to go in making offers and working for better relationships.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said the
                            operation protested has been stopped. All actions were completed. It was
                            set up last February and conducted in recent weeks.</p>

                        <p>Question of whether, and if so, how to release document in relatively
                            near future is now raised in view partial leakage contents of some
                            similar versions, most notably <hi rend="italic">France Soir</hi> 28 May
                            issue, and probability of further leakages of incomplete or distorted
                            versions. One important concern this connection is possibility that
                            versions so leaked by others will present speech in light unduly
                            favorable to present regime and will gain a measure of currency and
                            acceptance which would tender difficult this being overtaken by more
                            balanced version which we have.</p>
                        <p>Medium for release currently being most favorably considered here is that
                            entire document would be released by Committee for <pb n="108"

                                    the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech.
                                    After Cline explained his reasons for this position,
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he too favored
                                    release. According to Cline, the Director first called <persName

                                    their concurrences to releasing the speech. (Cline, <hi

                                    However, in a statement in Washington on November 29, 1976,
                                    James Angleton, who was head of <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

                                    division in 1956, disputed Cline’s version. According to
                                    Angleton, the decision to publish the speech “was made by

                        <p>In addition, I have had from entirely independent source confirmation of
                            certain specific details in document which tend to confirm its
                            credibility, as well as possibility that document may be actual speech
                            itself and not merely version prepared for Communist leaders in
                            satellite countries. These details come from French journalist, Michael
                            Gordey, at present in Moscow and he obtained this information from an
                            old Menshevik friend whom he had known well in Paris and who had
                            returned to Soviet Union in 1950. Gordey is of Russian parents, speaks
                            perfect Russian and is extremely knowledgeable about Soviet Union. He of
                            course has no knowledge whatsoever of existence document in question but
                            had seen French version in French Embassy. His informant had not
                            actually seen text of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech himself, but had received second-hand
                            account from old Bolshevik friend who I believe had actually been
                            present or in any event had seen stenographic account of speech. Version
                            of speech given Gordey followed very closely that outlined in document
                            and included certain specific details which were not in French version,
                            namely reference to <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            telephone call to Vasilevsky on Kharkov battle and his conversation on

                            telephone. Informant also gave in much greater detail than in French
                            version Eikhe, Kedrov, Rudzut and, particularly, Kirov cases.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Swedish Ambassador told me that Bulgarian Ambassador here,
                            who claims to have seen text of speech, had given him outline without
                            details and order of subjects and construction of speech from source
                            followed very closely order of subjects and general organization of
                            documents.</p>
                        <p>While nothing can be conclusive in a matter of this kind, I believe these
                            independent confirmations here in Moscow from persons stated above who
                            have no knowledge of our possession of document certainly tend to add to
                            its credibility.</p>
                        <p>In regard to publicity I am of two minds. In general I believe that
                            documents such as this concerning Soviet policies which are believed to
                            be genuine are worthwhile publishing in that they help clarify public
                            opinion and explain what is actually going on in this country, and this
                            document would be invaluable to students of Soviet affairs who would
                            normally not have access to it. However, I would seriously doubt if
                            publication would be valuable to our side from propaganda point of view.
                            Speech is extremely serious and convincing and goes far to providing
                            real evidence that current Soviet leadership determined to persist in
                            present mere “liberals” course and do away with certain abuses of STALIN
                            period. Theme throughout speech, particularly on page 12, that there
                            must be no repetition of STALIN’s crimes will, I am sure, be regarded as
                            strong evidence in many quarters that current leadership has indeed in
                            certain respects “reformed”. Very fact that text given in this document
                            is more balanced than previous speculations and leaks will, I feel, not
                            only tend to enhance its credibility but will give more credit than
                            discredit to present leadership. Fact that document when published will
                            undoubtedly be denounced as spurious by Communists will not, in my
                            opinion, offset reaction more favorable than not to present regime.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I would conclude if primary purpose of publication is to place
                            current rulers in unfavorable light, I would be inclined not to publish.
                            On the other hand, if main purpose is merely to get out an interesting
                            and important document concerning political developments in Soviet
                            Union, publication would be useful, particularly as leaks are almost
                            certain. In this connection I note (Paris 5677 to Department repeated

                        <p>2837. At last night’s reception I had short talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and following points
                            emerged. He seemed to be considerably more subdued than usual and
                            mentioned fact that he was very tired after his trip with Tito. <note
                                n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">During Tito’s visit to the Soviet Union, June
                                1–23, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> accompanied
                                him to Stalingrad, Rostov, and Novorossisk, June 10–13.</note> I
                            took advantage this reference to tell him that American and other
                            Western correspondents who had been along on trip with Tito were very
                            much displeased at discriminatory treatment they had received during
                            trip, and told him of complaints I had had in this regard from US
                            correspondents. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said
                            that he had been unaware of this on trip although he said Tito had
                            mentioned it to him, and brushed matter aside by stating that there were
                            still some bureaucrats in Soviet system who could not easily adjust to
                            new conditions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then in mild but
                            definite terms said that he simply did not understand attitude of US,
                            and particularly that of Mr. <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0144"
                                /><persName>Dulles</persName>, and felt that recent speeches and
                            statements were difficult to reconcile with views that had been
                            expressed at Geneva Conference. <note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">For
                                documentation on the Geneva Heads of Government meeting, July 18–23,

                                ff.</note> I told <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            that I felt that he simply did not understand operation of American
                            system with its free expression of opinion and, in particular, the
                            institution of press conferences where leading government officials were
                            subjected to free and untrammeled questioning by correspondents on any
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>He said he felt that while Soviet relations were improving with other
                            countries, with the US it was going very slowly indeed. Given this
                            opportunity I told him I thought words were insufficient in matters of
                            this kind and he surely realized special responsibility of the US to
                            which he agreed. I told him that as long as the major questions such as
                            Germany, disarmament and others which were the chief causes tension
                            remain unsolved that mere words on desirability of improved relations,
                            etc were not going to change situation. I gave him my personal opinion
                            that Soviet leaders seemed believe they could have everything their own
                            way and that the constant assault in their own statements and their
                            propaganda against measures such as, for example, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which US and its associates felt to
                            be vital to security seemed to me to be incompatible with the constantly
                            reiterated thesis of desire for co-existence and normal relations. I
                            told him that constant attacks on so-called policy of “positions of
                            strength” led me to believe the Soviet Union desired we should operate
                            from position of weakness while they maintained their strength intact.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> countered by
                            saying that at Geneva Soviet Union had indicated its willingness to
                            accept as an international fact <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and had proposed renunciation of force agreement between the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw Pact countries. I told him
                            I thought that additional pieces of paper of this nature were
                            unnecessary in view of the Charter of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and besides any such question brought US squarely up
                            against the problem of the division of Germany. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> did not argue point but
                            returned to his original thesis and said he felt the US did not
                            understand the depth and significance of changes which were taking place
                            in Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>I told him I did my best to keep my government informed but despite
                            certain improvements the area of secrecy was so great in this country
                            that it was very difficult for an Ambassador to obtain a clear picture
                            of what was going on. I mentioned in this connection fact that middle of
                            March the whole world knew that he had made very important speech to a
                            closed session of Congress but no reliable information on this subject
                            had been available in Moscow. (I did this in hope that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would make some remark on
                            subject of <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0145"/>version published by
                            Department.) <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at first
                            attempted to deny that there had been any special speech, but finding
                            this untenable he said versions had been circulated which did not
                            correspond to truth but denied (incidentally this is party line since
                            similar statements were made to me last night by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> with big smiles on their faces)
                            that he had read the version recently published on grounds that it
                            required “a big work of translation.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> then referred to

                            step which would lead to better understanding of Soviet Union, to which
                            I replied that would depend in no small measure to degree of frankness
                            which General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> was dealt

                            inquired after President’s health and expressed satisfaction when I told
                            him that his condition was excellent and from all accounts he had
                            undergone the operation without any difficulty.<note n="5"

                            translation into English runs to 34 double-spaced, legal length pages.
                            There are 17 documents involved, including Lenin’s “testament,” Lenin’s
                            note regarding the treatment of nationalities, and other notes by Lenin
                            regarding domestic policy.</p>
                        <p>We and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> have been examining the
                            documents to ascertain their authenticity and value in the event of
                            publication. The tentative consensus is that, while a small part of the
                            material has not been previously published, most of it has appeared in
                            one form or another in the West. On balance there seems to be little
                            additional propaganda or political advantage to the United States in
                            publication, but the documents would be of some interest to students of
                            Soviet history and would tend to some degree to keep alive interest in
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech. We have
                            reason to believe that both the British and French have also by now
                            obtained these documents, although they have not indicated any plans for
                            publication.</p>
                        <p>The view of <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>, P and ourselves is that
                            the documents would probably better serve US interests if released by
                            the British, but in any case, at a date to follow your speech in San
                            Francisco. <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> is exploring the
                            possibility of the British doing so. Alternatively, the documents could
                            be released as a routine matter here, at such time and in such fashion
                            as to encourage their tie-in with and focus upon the <persName

                            clearer, a recommendation will be made to you through Mr. <persName

                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                                Speech and Conflicts in Communist Parties</hi>—Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said there had been a “suspicious
                            similarity” between statements made by western communist parties
                            regarding <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s speech. He
                            thought there was something here to be exploited among the
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>Referring further to the speech, those present agreed that it had offered
                            good material for use by the informational agencies. The Secretary said
                            there should be policy guidance on what line to take. This should be
                            carefully thought through. He added “that we have an opportunity the
                            like of which might not occur again for many years. Now is the chance to
                            fragmentize the wall of granite of the International Communist Party.”
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> made two points:
                            One, that we should not ignore the Baltic States and, another, that
                            while <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had been jabbing
                            at STALIN’s brutality to Communists, he had not mentioned the cruelty to
                            the Koreans, Poles, Persians, Afghans, and many others. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if the <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> would not do something about this
                            problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>, insisting
                            that we should exploit this break, asked if <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech had been “circulated physically”
                            abroad. The Secretary reiterated that it should be translated and
                            printed in foreign languages, e.g., one-half million copies to
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Continuing on the same subject, the Secretary said he would speak about
                            it at his press conference on Tuesday. <note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">For

                            would make the point (1) that despotism can only hold together under
                            brutality and iron discipline and (2) this discipline was accepted only
                            in an atmosphere of constant victories. There had been no such recent
                            victories. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> asked if the
                            President could make a speech on July 4. The Secretary said that a
                            speech was not likely but a statement or television film might be
                            possible.</p>

                                Affecting U.S. Security</hi></p>
                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence said that he would like to comment
                            first on the reaction outside the Soviet bloc to the publication of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s secret speech at
                            the Twentieth Party Congress and the subsequent developments relating
                            thereto. There had been rather dramatic speeches by <persName
                                corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> and Nenni in Rome, followed by
                            statements in behalf of the Communist Parties of France, the United
                            States, the United Kingdom, and others. In addition, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> in Moscow has published the statement by <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGDA1">Dennis</persName>, head of the Communist Party,
                            USA, as reported in the <hi rend="italic">N Y. Daily Worker</hi> of June
                            18, 1956. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought it remarkable that the
                            Kremlin leaders should have selected the U.S. Communist Party criticism
                            as the springboard for their first public reaction to the publication of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech. He
                            predicted that the <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> statement would
                            presently be followed by other significant statements on this subject
                            from official Kremlin sources. All the above-mentioned reports had
                            contained criticism of the current leadership of the Soviet Union. The
                            chief question posed in all these statements was this: How did such
                            gross inequities creep into the Soviet system of government when all the
                            present Soviet leaders surrounded Stalin at this very time? To
                            illustrate his point Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> cited several
                            instances in which this question had been posed, particularly the manner
                            in which it had been posed by the <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1"
                                >Dennis</persName> statement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily
                                Worker.</hi> Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> emphasized that while
                            these statements were all critical in some degree of the present Soviet
                            leaders, an attempt was generally made in these statements to maintain
                            the link between the <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0149"/>local
                            Communist Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as distinct
                            from the current Soviet leadership.</p>
                        <p>In further elaboration of his general point, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that Nenni was having a “field
                            day” at the expense of the Kremlin. His objective appeared to be to
                            formulate an agreement for the creation of a popular front government in
                            Italy or at least to bring about the so-called “opening to the left”.
                            This objective has alarmed <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                                >Togliatti</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The basic question which emerges from all this current confusion is the
                            question as to what the Kremlin is actually driving at. Are these
                            developments simply the result of confusion in the Kremlin, or are they
                            the result of a deliberate design? Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                            this was a difficult question to answer, but he believed that the men in
                            the Kremlin certainly never intended that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s speech should produce such far-reaching
                            results as it had in fact produced. On the other hand, we must take into
                            account the possibility that the speech was deliberately designed to
                            confer a semblance of respectability and independence on the Communist
                            Parties in countries outside the Soviet bloc, with the ultimate
                            objective of producing popular front governments in these countries.
                            Even if this proves to be the case, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            pointed out the serious implications of any attack on a dictatorship and
                            its leaders. Whatever the ultimate purpose of the Kremlin, what has
                            actually happened may well impair the Soviet leadership in the end.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> whether he
                            perceived any objection to his reading a summary of a cable from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName><note n="2"

                            of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at the reception in

                                >Twining</persName> and the leaders of other Air Force delegations.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            was only concerned that the fact that this information had come from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName> be kept within
                            the walls of the room. Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName> proceeded to describe the ineptness, discourtesy,
                            and general misconduct of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> at this reception, emphasizing in particular
                            the obvious disgust of the other Soviet leaders with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s behavior. This, said Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, at least indicated that the present
                            leaders of the Soviet Union were not very happy, and that they had a lot
                            of serious problems on their hands. It might well be possible for the

                            concluded his observations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stated his belief that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was the most dangerous
                            person to lead the Soviet Union since the October Revolution. <pb
                                n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0150"/>He was not a coldly calculating
                            person, but rather one who reacted emotionally. He was obviously
                            intoxicated much of the time, and could be expected to commit irrational
                            acts. The previous Soviet leaders had been for the most part the
                            chess-playing type. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            was the first top authority in the USSR who was essentially emotional
                            and perfectly capable of acting without a calculation of the
                            consequences of his action. Stalin always calculated the results of a
                            proposed action. Bad as he was, you at least knew what you were up
                            against in dealing with him. In fact, Stalin’s only serious blunder was
                            the Korean war, and this could readily be forgiven him in view of the
                            fact that the U.S. Administration at the time had given every possible
                            indication that the United States was indifferent to what happened in
                            Korea. All in all, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, he would be glad indeed to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> go, and there was evidently
                            considerable feeling in the governing circles in the USSR that he ought
                            to be fired. Unhappily there was no easy means to get rid of him. Death
                            or violence were about the only recourse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            a special meeting of the Supreme Soviet had been called in Moscow for
                            the middle of July. It was possible that something would happen at this
                            meeting along the lines Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had been talking about.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in
                            addition to the cable from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1"
                                >Bohlen</persName> just summarized by the Director of Central
                            Intelligence, a later cable from the Ambassador had arrived in the State
                                Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Telegram 2920 from Moscow,
                                June 26. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 700.5861/6–2656)</note> It
                            described the reception at the Kremlin given for the Shah of Iran.
                            Notable were reflections by <persName>Marshal Zhukov</persName> on the
                            behavior of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> at the
                            previously mentioned reception for the Air Force delegations. Of great
                            interest also was <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s
                            statement that U.S. estimates of the production of Soviet aircraft and
                            submarines were much too high.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired as to what line the United States should take
                            with respect to the apparently growing independence of the Communist
                            Parties in countries outside the Soviet bloc. Are we to regard this
                            phenomenon as a calculated effort to confer respectability on these
                            national Communist Parties, or are we to take it as evidence of
                            confusion and weakness in the Soviet leadership and in their control of
                            national Communist Parties? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> replied that it was impossible to give a clear
                            answer to the Vice President’s question as yet. The issue was still the
                            subject of vigorous argument. Nevertheless, one line that we seemed safe
                            in playing up was that there was obvious confusion in the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> commented that in
                            his opinion there was a good possibility that all these statements
                            critical of the current <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0151"/>Soviet
                            leadership were part of a central plan devised by Moscow. If this was
                            indeed the case, the Soviet objective would be to position themselves
                            more effectively for the newly developing phase of economic, political
                            and psychological warfare against the free world. It seemed quite
                            possible to Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> sometimes
                            pretended to be drunk and that his indiscretions might well be
                            deliberate. At the same time, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> emphasized that the Soviet leaders are
                            unleashing forces that no one, not even these leaders themselves, could
                            be sure would not get out of control. In any event, both possibilities
                            deserved careful study, for the United States must not permit itself to
                            be caught flat-footed, whichever possibility proved to be the fact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied that
                            there was still about a 50–50 division of opinion among the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> experts as to which of these two
                            possibilities was correct. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> added that he
                            himself personally inclined to believe that the Soviet leaders were in
                            fact now engaged in making the best of a bad situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>’
                            opinion. He warned, however, that this did not mean that the Soviet
                            leaders could not ultimately snatch a victory from their current
                            difficulties. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            then paid a warm tribute to the success of the Director of Central
                            Intelligence in obtaining a copy of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s secret speech and having the contents of it
                            published. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            described this as the greatest feat by American Intelligence in a number
                            of years.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that the problem posed by these developments in the Soviet Union could
                            be described as follows: The Kremlin leaders, being generally recognized
                            as evil men, had in past years generally been ostracized by civilized
                            people. Since we agree that these leaders are evil men, should our
                            objective be to try to maintain them in a state of ostracism; or,
                            alternatively, ought we try to induce them to shed their evil ways, even
                            though we realize that in doing so they will gradually cease to be
                            ostracized?</p>

                                xml:id="d55fn4">A transcript of the Secretary’s news conference on

                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he preferred
                            the course of action of trying to induce the rulers of the Soviet Union
                            to shed their wicked ways.</p>
                        <p>As for what had happened as a consequence of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was quite sure that the
                            Soviet leaders had never planned to have events happen as they did. On
                            the other hand, since developments had followed the course that we have
                            seen, the Soviet leaders are now trying to make the best of it.
                            Certainly we do not want to assist them in this endeavor. On the <pb
                                n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0152"/>other hand, the United States
                            certainly cannot take the position that developments since the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech are meaningless, that
                            nothing whatsoever has happened in the Kremlin, and that no changes are
                            taking place in the USSR. As a matter of fact, the allies of the United
                            States go much further than we do in accepting the reality of the
                            changes which are occurring in the USSR. The United States will be in
                            real danger of isolation from its allies if it refuses to accept the
                            possibility of some real changes in Soviet practices.</p>
                        <p>Basic to the whole situation in the USSR, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> insisted that it was impossible
                            to run a dictatorship like the Soviet dictatorship without having
                            recourse to terrorism and iron discipline such as Stalin had
                            consistently employed. Stalin was no mere sadist; he employed terror
                            methods simply because he realized that it was essential to instill
                            terror in order to rule the people of the USSR. Nevertheless, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the people of a
                            dictatorship will not go on accepting terrorism unless it is accompanied
                            by a series of victories for the government which employs the terror. If
                            you go for a period of five years without a significant victory, as was
                            now the case in the USSR, the people will simply no longer endure to be
                            governed by terrorism. This is a lesson that history teaches about all
                            dictatorships, and history is the best guide as to what is now occurring
                            in the Soviet Union. Hitler illustrated the same phenomenon in his own
                            career.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> warned that all
                            this did not mean that the United States would not now have to face up
                            to another very grave problem—namely, the problem of preventing the
                            creation of popular fronts, including the Communist and Socialist
                            Parties, in many countries of the world. Happily, even this danger was
                            not at present as great as it had been, for instance, six months ago.

                            distinct setbacks to the Soviet objective of winning over the Socialists
                            to cooperation with the Communist Parties. There was, after all, a basic
                            cleavage between the Communist and the Socialist Parties, and that
                            cleavage had become increasingly apparent since the contacts of the last
                            six months between Socialist and Communist leaders. Accordingly, the
                            likelihood of a rapprochement between these two parties was now less
                            than it was six months ago, although, of course, the Soviets would keep
                            on trying.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                            that we were too inclined generally to believe that nothing ever
                            happened with respect to Soviet policy and action except as the
                            infallible result of carefully laid Soviet plans. To ascribe such
                            infallibility to the Kremlin was an error. Indeed, part of what had
                            happened in recent months in the Soviet Union had happened because we
                            ourselves in the U.S. Government had planned it that way.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> then turned to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and said that
                            his earlier remarks should not be taken as an indication of a belief
                            that no significant changes had occurred in the Soviet Union and that
                            the policies of the Secretary of State and the President had not
                            likewise had a great deal to do with the effecting of these changes. In
                            his earlier remarks, said Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName>, he had only wished to suggest the possibility
                            that the events transpiring in the Soviet Union may be the result of a
                            general policy directive agreed upon in advance by the Kremlin
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said he had one
                            last thought to inject into the discussion—namely, that Marshal Tito may
                            have played a role in what had been happening since the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> speech. He reminded the
                            Council that <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> had paid a
                            visit to Tito just before the latter had started on his trip to Moscow.
                            It was quite possible that on this occasion Tito may have urged upon
                                <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> a greater and more
                            independent role for the national Communist Parties, both in the
                            satellites and in the free world.</p>

                                <item>The Central Committee resolution appears as an effort to keep
                                    under control further critical discussions of Stalin and prevent
                                    such discussions from becoming an inquiry into the
                                    characteristics of the Soviet system and the past actions of
                                    current Soviet leaders. In response to the recent questioning of
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> and others,
                                    it advances an explanation of how Stalin managed to gain control
                                    and why he was not removed. Moscow presumably expects foreign
                                    Communists to accept this explanation and terminate their
                                    discussions, since the resolution stresses that Stalin is a
                                    thing of the past and in effect warns that critical discussions
                                    of the Stalin situation parallel efforts of the imperialists to
                                    distract the working class from future tasks.</item>

                                    how difficult it is for Moscow to provide a serious explanation
                                    so long as the Soviet rulers refuse to permit discussion of the
                                    Soviet system and their own relations with Stalin.</item>

                                    previously suggested by various foreign Communists. Moscow does
                                    go beyond its previous position, however, of ascribing
                                    everything to Stalin’s vanity and argues that historical
                                    conditions, chiefly capitalist encirclement, also operated as a

                                <item>The explanation of why Stalin was not removed omits some
                                    points mentioned in <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                        >Khrushchev</persName>’s secret speech and provides some new
                                    points, but these raise more questions than they answer. The
                                    resolution denies that no counteraction was taken against Stalin
                                    and, <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0155"/>without
                                    elaboration, asserts that Party and military figures restricted
                                    his activity during the war. It also for the first time alleges
                                    that a “Leninist nucleus” existed in the Central Committee and,
                                    immediately after the death of Stalin, began the struggle
                                    against the cult of personality. These two new elements raise
                                    the possibility that within the Soviet ruling circle an effort
                                    is under way to build a case designed to absolve at least some
                                    of the current rulers from co-responsibility for Stalin’s
                                    excesses and even to claim that these excesses had been opposed

                            <item>It will be recalled that the expert expressed the view, prior to
                                the publication on June 4 by the State Department of a version of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> secret speech,
                                that it might be wiser and more effective in the long run if more
                                “indirect means” could be found for releasing the document and
                                exploiting its contents to our advantage. About two weeks after the
                                publication of the document, the expert told me that he had been
                                most agreeably surprised to find such a heavy percentage of
                                favorable and useful reaction in the foreign press (extracts of
                                which I have been furnishing to him on a continuing basis). He said
                                that in his opinion this enterprise had come through the first phase
                                more successfully than he would have predicted, and that on the
                                whole things are rolling along very well. He felt certain that the
                                impact upon the Free World Communist parties had been almost
                                shattering and that they were filled with confusion and dismay. He
                                commented particularly upon the “conspicuous malaise and bitterness
                                of <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName>”, whom he regards
                                as a most significant bellwether of Free World Communist leadership.
                                He also commented in this same conversation upon the obvious
                                difficulties of the satellite Communist leadership, and repeated his
                                continuing view that the Kremlin leadership itself appears to be on
                                the defensive and to have opened up a Pandora’s Box for themselves.
                                He was, however, quite strongly inclined to the view that now the

                                    <item>The Resolution, especially the use which is made of the
                                        Poznan riots to blame all of their problems on “subversive
                                        imperialist intervention”, is a typically Stalinist
                                        reaction; after all the Kremlin leadership were Stalin’s own
                                        pupils, especially in so far as the non-Communist world is
                                        concerned. It appears more and more clearly that the
                                        differences between the present leadership and Stalin are
                                        mainly tactical as regards their handling of the outside
                                        world and in the conduct of foreign affairs generally. They
                                        seemed to feel that Stalin had missed a lot of good bets;
                                        viz., had made enemies <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127"

                                        the Free World against him—and also Stalin had failed to
                                        cash in on many opportunities which should have been easily
                                        exploitable to the advantage of the Soviet Union.</item>

                                    <item>The effort to justify the dictatorship in the 1920’s and
                                        early 1930’s in terms of capitalist encirclement is a
                                        Stalinist explanation and one which was entirely unwarranted
                                        by the factual situation. No one was planning to attack the
                                        Soviet Union during that period. They no doubt did have need
                                        of a tightening-up of the reins of authority when the threat
                                        of Nazi Germany became real, slow as Stalin was to open his
                                        eyes to the true nature of that menace.</item>

                                    <item>The tone and content of the Resolution indicate that the
                                        Kremlin is very worried and their dragging in of the
                                        references to the Poznan revolt underscores this worry. It
                                        is of the greatest importance that they not be allowed to
                                        get away with this new lie. The expert said that whereas he

                                        involvement or responsibility, he wanted to underscore in
                                        particular the importance of the avoidance on our part of
                                        any statements or actions which would be susceptible of the
                                        interpretation that we were involved—i.e., “let the lady not

                        <p>(2) We discussed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            speech and the controversy between the various Communist Parties which
                            had resulted. I indicated that I felt that important forces were at work
                            and that the Soviet Communists were in a dilemma of either allowing
                            liberal <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0158"/>forces to grow and
                            obtain recognition, or else revert to Stalinist type of repression, in
                            which case they would lose the ground they had been trying to gain with
                            the free nations as having become more civilized and liberal.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to a letter he had received <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d58fn2">Not further identified.</note> criticizing my having
                            spoken publicly about this matter. He said he merely sent this to me for
                            information and not because he accepted that viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>I said this problem like many others could be dealt with more readily if
                            only part of the problem were considered. Our difficulty in the State
                            Department was that we had to weigh all angles. In this case, it was
                            very important from the standpoint of the Mutual Security legislation to
                            portray our past policies as successful and to have some reason such as
                            their success for continuing these policies. Furthermore, all that I
                            said and did in this matter was very carefully weighed not only in the
                            Department of State but also with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName>. The President indicated his complete
                            understanding of the matter and approval of what I had done.</p>

                        <p>1. The publication of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            “secret” speech of 25 February created a strain, bearing certain
                            appearances of a crisis, in the <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0159"
                            />relationship of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (<gloss
                                target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>) with the Communist parties of Europe
                            and the United States. It accentuated prevailing tensions in at least
                            some of the East European satellites. However, it does not seem to have
                            affected Communist developments in Asia and Africa, judging from the few
                            cautious reactions noted so far.</p>
                        <p>2. In the West, the controversy came into the open with questioning
                            statements by the French <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>, strong
                            denunciations by <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> and
                            Nenni, and somewhat milder criticism by the British and American <gloss
                                target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>s, all between 18 and 24 June. Some of the
                            smaller European parties joined in the fray. Soviet failure to provide
                            for publication of the speech by Communist organs, and the subsequent
                            lack of an immediate explanatory follow-up unquestionably disconcerted
                            Western <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> leaders and caused confusion
                            among the rank and file of Party members and fellow travelers.
                            Nevertheless, the Western scoop only brought to a head the restlessness
                            which had vexed the parties ever since the 20th Congress of the <gloss
                                target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> and created a need to vent pent-up
                            feelings.</p>
                        <p>3. In the satellite orbit, East German Party chief Ulbricht’s criticism
                            was the first to be heard. Subsequent press comments, while chiming in
                            with Ulbricht, made it clear, however, that criticism was to remain
                            within bounds. The Polish press published most of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName>’s interview, without comment.
                            A direct connection of the Poznan uprisings with the present Communist
                            crisis probably cannot be established. Rather, the uprisings may have
                            been the result of more liberal policies promised after the 20th
                            Congress, just as the East German uprisings of 17 June 1953 followed the
                            introduction of <persName corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName>’s “new
                            course”. The Hungarian press quoted a few lines of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> statement. During the post
                            20th Congress period, ferment increased, more among the intelligentsia
                            of Hungary than among the workers, who stood on the side lines and
                            seemed inclined to let the Party leaders fight the issues among
                            themselves. However, the <hi rend="italic">Petöfi</hi> circle of young
                            intellectuals is promoting critical discussions and, at least by
                            implication, demanding that Nagy replace Rakosi. As far as is known, no
                            other satellite government permitted publication of the Western Party
                            criticism, even though leaders occasionally referred to it.</p>
                        <p>4. The Chinese Communist Party which reacted slowly to the theses of the
                            20th <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> Congress and finally came out
                            with a statement of restrained endorsement, has apparently not
                            participated in the subsequent controversy. It merely printed parts of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> interview alongside
                            the 30 June Resolution, without comment. The Japanese <gloss
                                target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>, too, has been reluctant to take sides.
                            That Party’s leadership is probably preoccupied by factional fights

                            which is trying to keep its peace with both Stalin and <persName

                            the state of mind of the Communist leadership in the uncommitted areas.
                            Similarly, the Indian <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> did not
                            criticize <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> severely,
                            merely indicating that Stalin’s merits should not be altogether
                            forgotten and that further explanations should be provided. The
                            Resolution will probably furnish sufficient clarification, from the
                            point of view of the Indian <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>
                            leadership, which is concerned lest the masses become even more confused
                            than they already are. In general, Communist parties in the uncommitted
                            areas may be so impressed with Soviet activities, profitable to them,
                            that they will submerge the controversy over the “secret” speech and at
                            least pretend to be content with the Resolution. We believe that the
                            course charted by the 20th Congress will prove more appealing to the
                            Communists in these areas than was rigid Stalinism. As more Party
                            “autonomy” is stressed, native nationalism may gradually lose its fear
                            of the USSR as a new source of potential foreign domination.</p>

                            July, was issued to provide an answer to the Communist critics. Although
                            the document was signed by the Central Committee, there is no evidence
                            that a plenary meeting of the Committee actually took place. The
                            document appears to have been hastily drafted; it is repetitive and
                            apologetic. In the endeavor to exculpate themselves, the Soviet leaders
                            modified their previous statements regarding Stalin’s behavior during
                            World War II. They now claimed that they had succeeded in “sharply
                            restricting” the dictator during this period but they admitted that
                            afterwards they were unable to do so. Being psychologically cornered,
                            the Soviet leaders aggressively revealed their revolutionary intentions
                            more bluntly than in the 20th Congress statements, and their
                            interpretation of the Party line is anything but mellow. The Resolution
                            does not answer many pertinent questions raised by the criticism, nor
                            does it deal sternly with the “rebels”. It slightly slaps <persName
                                corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName>’s wrist but on the other hand
                            quotes his positive statements, along with similar quotations from the
                                <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss>s of China, France and the US,
                            purporting to show that the fraternal parties throughout the world have
                            approved of the new Soviet policies.</p>
                        <p>8. In order to dispel any impression among the Free World parties that
                            the Soviet system had changed fundamentally, the <gloss
                                target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> emphasized again and again that the
                            underlying principle of Communist strategy is and remains
                            Marxism-Leninism. The paraphernalia of this ideology are unchanged: the
                            Leninist principle of Party leadership (i.e. the dictatorship of the
                            Party); the reinvigoration of “socialist democracy” (i.e. “democratic
                            centralism”, internally and externally); the use of cadres for the
                            attainment of special targets (i.e. undercover activities); the
                            continued interest in proletarian solidarity (i.e. central control of
                            Communism in one form or another); and a more flexible method to achieve
                            and maintain such solidarity (i.e. a tendency, for the time being, to
                            retain control without rigid organization such as the Comintern). The
                            Resolution (which falsely ascribes Stalin’s thesis of building
                            “socialism in one country” to Lenin) caters to former Stalinists as well
                            as to those of Titoist leanings. It officially restates its undying
                            enmity toward the imperialist West in general and the US in particular.
                            It clearly disposes of any hope concerning changes which might decrease
                            the Communist threat. Rather it confirms the 20th Congress proclamation
                            of a Communist Renaissance following the Stalinist Dark Age.</p>
                        <p>9. Such a Renaissance, in the view of the Soviet leaders, can only be
                            achieved by recognizing that previous tactics have become obsolete and

                            its predominance in World Communism. It should be understood that
                            “autonomy” will be limited to local interpretations of Soviet policies.
                            Even prior to the 20th Congress, the visit to Belgrade<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d59fn3">The Soviet leaders visited Yugoslavia May–June

                                <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> affairs. So far as the satellites
                            are concerned, the Soviet leaders probably felt that Party autonomy
                            could be confined to external manifestations without touching the
                            substance of control, thereby preventing the emergence of genuine
                            Titoism. They probably reasoned that, doctrinally, the People’s
                            Democracies have already chosen their road to socialism. Moreover, the
                            political and economic dependence of the satellites upon the USSR, which
                            is about to be further strengthened by impending economic integration
                            into the Soviet Bloc, guarantees, by and large, the loyalties of the
                            leadership. Having an overriding vested interest in the continuation of
                            a Soviet-Satellite union, and controlling their armed forces and the
                            police, the Satellite Communist leaders can be expected to prevent
                            anti-regime resistance from creating more than occasional rioting.
                            Serious tendencies toward Titoism could, if necessary, be curbed by
                            Soviet armed forces. SRS believes that the Eastern Bloc is politically,
                            economically, and militarily now so tightly knit that major deviations
                            could and would not be tolerated by Soviet leaders. Occasional flareups
                            of local independence, such as the Hungarian radio outburst of 3 July
                            following Suslov’s visit, will be treated as vents for national
                            self-assertion but they will have little real meaning. In other words,
                            there is no reason to believe that the satellites will not remain
                            satellites.</p>

                        <p>11. The Soviet leaders probably foresaw difficulties with the Western
                            powers when they launched the anti-Stalin campaign. But they may have
                            looked upon Western Communist outbursts as tempests in the samovar which
                            in time would calm themselves without harming the cause. They must have
                            concluded that minor “revolts” of Western parties need not impede Soviet
                            advance into the political vacuum of the uncommitted areas seething with
                            powerful nationalist aspirations. There are indications that Asia and
                            Africa are now the prime targets of Communism, taking precedence over
                            stalemated Western Europe for the present.</p>
                        <p>12. The <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss>, with the help of the
                            Central Committee’s Resolution, will try to tighten the Party Line which
                            had become somewhat diffused in the aftermath of the denunciation of
                            Stalin. The <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> leaders have embarked
                            on a grand-scale tactical maneuver to overcome the obstacles in their
                            way and to hasten the advent of a socialist society. In its bold
                            conception, this tactic transcends that of Lenin’s New Economic Policy
                                (<gloss target="#t_NEP1">NEP</gloss>). Basically, it uses the
                            technique of decentralizing International Communism. The former
                            Stalinist crime of “nationalist deviation” has now been declared a
                            Leninist virtue.</p>
                        <p>13. In this connection there is evidence that Tito is still thinking of a
                            world-wide Socialist-Communist combination, a “Fifth International”, as
                            it has been called. His interest in closer relations with Socialists has
                            been developing ever since his break with the Cominform, and the theses
                            of the 20th Congress probably have given new impetus to an old <gloss

                                Soviet Union June 1–23.</note> It is conceivable that the Kremlin,
                            far from objecting, in fact encouraged him to go ahead. It may have
                            believed that such a combination would greatly stimulate United Front
                            developments and would impress many “advanced” socialists in the
                            uncommitted areas. However, this new “International” would differ from
                            its predecessors, at least for the time being, in avoiding formal
                            organization. Tito appears to envisage it as a loose association of
                            leftists. Presumably he still is averse to becoming a member of a more
                            formal organization, the control of which could pass into the hands of
                            the USSR. Thus it may be assumed that, at the outset, the new
                            “International” would center around Socialist and Communist groups of
                            the Free World, notably from uncommitted areas, and that the USSR would
                            not insist upon active participation or leadership. While the Soviet
                            leaders may not be entirely happy about such a development, they
                            probably believe that for the advancement of World Communism, Titoism is
                            preferable to “reformist” socialism. Moreover, the Soviet <pb n="134"
                                xml:id="pg_134" facs="0164"/>leaders probably expect that
                            Socialists, by affiliating themselves with the new “International” would
                            be more likely to break away from the influence of the Second
                            International in general and the European Social Democrats in
                            particular, which still is considerable.</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of the new “International”
                            is not to be confounded with attempts on the part of Tito, which appear
                            to be supported by the USSR, to create a neutralist “zone of peace”. The
                            implementation of this objective would greatly assist the USSR in its
                            efforts to detach the Afro-Asian nations from Western influence and to
                            substitute that of the USSR through political and economic
                            manipulations. Evidently, both the creation of a neutralist combination
                            of states and the establishment of a new Socialist-Communist
                            “International” are viewed as supplementing each other. For the
                            implementation of both plans, Tito may have been accorded a leading role
                            as a mediator between the radical and moderate political groups, as a
                            man who has demonstrated how to remain neutral even against heavy odds.
                            But while the formal establishment of a neutralist bloc probably would
                            meet with resistance on the part of leaders who seek to remain
                            unattached to any type of political alignment, an informal “Fifth
                            International” might win the sympathy of many leftists who desire a
                            political position halfway between social democracy and Communism.</p>
                        <p>15. Although these developments may raise hopes that the deterioration of
                            Communism is imminent, SRS does not believe that such hopes are
                            justified. On the contrary, we feel that in the long run the danger of
                            Communist encroachment is likely to increase rather than decrease. A
                            determined, gradualist, and purposefully flexible Communist policy, not
                            always recognizable as such, is difficult to combat with means at the
                            disposal of a democratic country. In SRS–1 <note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5"

                            the narrow dogmatism of Stalin’s era and might even go beyond Lenin’s
                                <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>democratic centralism
                            toward Tito’s “polycentralism”. Such a decentralization of World
                            Communism would provide for a flexibility of maneuvering that could not
                            easily be matched by the more cumbersome parliamentary machineries of
                            the West. Barring vigorous and novel Western countermeasures, the
                            Titoist gamble of the Soviet leaders appears to have good chances of
                            success. We may find Communism greatly expanding and possibly
                            confronting the West with an unfriendly world combination of Socialists
                            and Communists. Such a combination might flourish in an atmosphere which
                            the USSR deliberately kept free of international tension.</p>
                        <p>16. Nevertheless, there are risks for the Communists. Their long-range
                            tactic of decentralization might lead to a loosening of discipline and
                            to fractionalization, especially in Europe. Without monolithic
                            isolation, Communism could lose its spell, and might even be infected by
                            evolutionary socialism. However, in our opinion, such a development is
                            not likely to occur, unless the US and the West act vigorously to
                            exploit prevailing Communist confusion, to counter the Soviet economic
                            offensive effectively, and to undertake a more aggressive program for
                            the conquest of man’s mind. There is still considerable wishful thinking
                            on the Western side. European and US newspapers have sensationalized
                            Communist Party criticism; they have played down indications that the
                            USSR still is the base of World Communism and that Communist Parties
                            remain dependent upon Soviet ideological guidance, financial help, and
                            organizational leadership.</p>
                        <p>17. We conclude that the present crisis, if in fact it is one, is not a
                            grave danger for World Communism. We see no convincing reason to assume
                            that the USSR has lost its ability to control the Communist movement. We
                            believe that the <gloss target="#t_CPSU1">CPSU</gloss> leaders, when
                            they launched the campaign against Stalin, probably expected
                            manifestations of discontent. Nevertheless, they were willing to relax
                            their absolute control of the Western parties, at least temporarily, in
                            the belief that they could re-establish Soviet hegemony at will. We
                            further believe that the Resolution will suffice as an “explanation”,
                            even though many questions remained unanswered, as the CPUSA and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Togliatti</persName> have already pointed
                            out. The Western Communist leaders will probably not press for further
                            elaboration. As parish priests, they will interpret the Soviet
                            encyclicals in accordance with their own needs, without resorting to the
                            Moscow high priests. The line for such additional interpretation
                            probably has been communicated to those European leaders (all members of
                            the Cominform) who reportedly congregated in Moscow at the time the
                            Resolution was published. We believe that the USSR’s main concern will
                            be the exploitation of Communism in Asia and Africa. In this area, it
                            probably will proceed cautiously, dealing with national governments <pb
                                n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0166"/>rather than with Party
                            officials, in pursuit of its economic offensive. Overtly, it will be
                            circumspect, avoiding “interference in the internal affairs” of other
                            countries. Covertly, it will press toward the formation of United Fronts
                            and other Socialist-Communist combinations. Where their parties are
                            outlawed, Communists will join socialist groups, thereby gaining and
                            maintaining Communist influence in any new political combinations. If
                            intra-Communist squabbles should continue or increase, it is possible
                            that a tougher Party line may be adopted. The <gloss target="#t_CPSU1"

                        <p>Russians who made these remarks to Fischer hoped Voice would improve and
                            give them straight news, facts and viewpoints of US without irritating
                            Russian patriot feelings. One friend remarked “no matter what we think
                            of regime, we are patriots”.</p>
                        <p>Other information follows which was told in strict confidence. He was
                            struck by freedom with which ordinary people talked as compared with
                            Stalinist era and relative absence of fear of police. He also noted
                            persons asked questions that would never have been put forward in
                            pre-war days and which indicated people are beginning to think of
                            themselves. For instance, one student asked him what he thought of
                            Marxism in such a way as to indicate it was not gospel. Writers felt
                            freer and paid less attention to “directives” in publication.</p>
                        <p>Everybody with whom he talked had read secret <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> speech to which they referred as a “letter”.
                            Depth of revelation had shocked them. In talking with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> latter made remark he (Fischer)
                            had some bad things in his books about Soviet Union. Fischer replied
                            they were not worse than “facts revealed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> speech and asked why it could not be
                            published in Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName> said “still too early to do this”. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> revealed towards end of
                            Stalinist regime he was “facing destruction” and he otherwise let
                            Fischer know he was violent anti-Stalinist.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>Fischer found great respect for <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> among his old friends who thought he was “not
                            finished as a top leader”. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> was greatly respected for his competence,
                            culture and breeding.</p>
                        <p>Russian friends greeted Fischer with open arms and saw him several times
                            without in any way showing fear of police. One friend saw him five
                            times. Thanks to <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> visa was
                            extended from eight to twenty days.</p>
                        <p>Fischer requested especially in using above information it not be
                            attributed to him for fear it possibly endanger friends whom he saw.</p>

                            beginning December, probably latter. He gave explanation preoccupation
                            leading party workers with harvest, state visits scheduled for October
                            and November 6 holiday.</p>

                            expressed himself as extremely “pleased” with record harvest and said
                            that agricultural results this year had been outstanding in all fields,
                            including corn. He denounced as nonsense reports in foreign press of any
                            major domestic problems, and said “Our affairs here are going very well
                            (pomaslu)”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> said it seems difficult

                            appointments.</p>
                        <p>Appointment <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> raises several
                            questions regarding motivations behind move and possible policy
                            implications which impossible answer intelligently on basis present
                            information; however, whatever may be specific reasons for appointment,
                            it does not seem to indicate or presage measurable increase, if any, un
                                [<hi rend="italic">of?</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s standing in Soviet leadership. Regarding rumor
                            circulating here last week that <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> to be appointed Chairman Council Ministers and
                            Party First Secretary respectively, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s new assignment would appear to lay to rest
                            speculation that he might be elevated to top party spot. Should also be
                            noted that Minister State Control as presently constituted is relatively
                            minor post (previous incumbent Zhavoronkov merely candidate member party
                            Central Committee), although as considered below possibility not
                            excluded that job could become more important under <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, appointment announcement specifies <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> retains post First Deputy
                            Chairman Council Ministers and no reason <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                facs="0170"/>assume his position as member party Presidium affected.
                            Thus, appointment cannot be interpreted as signifying radical
                            downgrading <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Within these limits, there are several possible interpretations of
                            reasons for and significance move. (1) This could be basically
                            trouble-shooting assignment. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> has had previous experience this field.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in Central

                            Ministry and called for “radical reorganization its work (although press
                            since then has given little attention to subject). (2) New appointment
                            may be time-filling spot designed to charge <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> with operational duties as far removed from
                            foreign policy field as possible. Well known that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s differences with present
                            dominant party leadership over foreign policy (particularly
                            rapprochement with Yugoslavia) led to his loss of major influence on
                            foreign policy in 1955 and relinquishment 1956 post Foreign Minister. In
                            this case, present difficulties satellite relations could explain timing
                            of move. However, this would appear unnecessary in view Soviet-Polish
                            declaration and <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article today stressing as
                            official policy “different roads to socialism” concept which <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> supposedly opposed.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing reasoning would also appear less cogent if <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> were to retain responsibilities
                            in cultural field which he has held sometime since he stepped down as
                            Foreign Minister. As previously reported, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> in conversation with me few weeks ago confirmed
                            earlier rumors that he was responsible for overseeing cultural
                            activities. As late as November 20 <hi rend="italic">Soviet Culture</hi>
                            printed account meeting held by Ministry Culture on pictorial arts at
                            which <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> given top billing
                            and delivered address. (3) Appointment could possibly foreshadow shift
                            economic policy with possible attendant personnel changes. Switch to
                            greater emphasis on consumer goods production could produce economic
                            problems requiring strengthening watch-dog functions this Ministry.</p>
                        <p>One clue to significance <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s
                            appointment is question future functions and responsibilities Ministry
                            on State Control. If Ministry’s responsibilities remain roughly at level
                            of past few years this could indicate appointment <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> in effect demotion. On other
                            hand, if his appointment signifies radical increase in role this

                        <p>According to the memorandum of discussion at the 305th meeting of the
                            National Security Council on November 30, Director of Central
                            Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> made
                            the following statement in his briefing on significant world
                            developments affecting United States security: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that reports from both the
                                    American Embassy and other sources in Moscow were giving us
                                    fairly hard evidence of unrest in the Soviet Union itself. So
                                    far this unrest was mostly confined to youth and student groups.
                                    Such groups were expressing open sympathy for Hungary and
                                    calling for the creation of more than one political party in the
                                    Soviet Union. After citing certain specific instances of such
                                    student activity, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out
                                    that while these were small indications, they seemed to be signs
                                    of real discontent. There were even some signs of unrest in the
                                    field of labor. Other rumors concerning dissension in the high
                                    command in Moscow so far lacked confirmation, though it was
                                    certainly likely that there had been real attacks on <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s policies In this
                                    connection Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that as
                                    long as the Soviet Union remained under such fire as it now was,
                                    it was very likely that the top Soviet leadership would try to
                                    hold together. The Central Committee was scheduled to meet
                                    before the end of the current year. If any changes are to occur
                                    in Soviet leadership, the meeting of this Committee might be the
                                    occasion of the announcement. While there was no doubt that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s policy
                                    was under fire, it remained difficult to see who could
                                    successfully replace him. It was the general opinion of the
                                    intelligence community that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"

                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence stated that a dramatic
                                    announcement could be expected some time today from Moscow. He
                                    pointed out that he had earlier informed the National Security

                                    cancellation of the annual Air Show. This had been followed by
                                    an abrupt postponement of a visit by the Soviet leaders to
                                    Czechoslovakia. Today <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> had

                                    There were now unconfirmed press rumors that a purge was about
                                    to occur which would remove four top leaders accused of
                                    deviation. Included, according to these rumors, were <persName

                            expelled from the Central Committee. The new Presidium consisted of 15

                        <p>I asked Soldatov whether Soviets had in mind plane for use Soviet
                            Ambassador exclusively and whether he had at this time specific request
                            to make. He replied Soviet Government was only now “studying” question;
                            it had no specific request to make at moment; Soviet plane might be for
                            use Soviet Ambassador or for important delegations such as Soviet
                            Delegation to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In reply my direct
                            question he said he did not expect specific reply this matter now but
                            merely desired “express hope” that if specific request made in future it
                            would meet with US agreement.</p>
                        <p>Obvious from manner in which this question has been raised twice in
                            succession that Soviets are seriously considering request to send Soviet
                            plane to US for official purposes at least in next few months. Question
                            of what type of plane they would or could use and alternative routes are
                            technical questions which Department may wish to discuss with Air Force.
                            When I referred in conversation with Soldatov to fact that during war
                            Soviet planes had flown to US via Alaska and inquired whether they had
                            any particular route in mind, he confined his reply to restating they
                            were only studying matter.</p>
                        <p>We suggest that this matter be given thorough study and that Department
                            be prepared to answer specific Soviet request at any time in near
                            future. Soviet practice with regard use Ambassador’s plane here is to
                            require at least ten days prior notice.</p>
                        <p>Tying request for agreement in principle to flights to Moscow of
                            Ambassador’s special aircraft, Soviets have made it perfectly plain that
                            refusal would result automatically in immediate cessation of privilege
                            we have long enjoyed. Aside from Air Force considerations, result would

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> displayed a chart
                            entitled “USSR Party and Government Organization”. With this chart as

                            in the USSR as the most dramatic which had occurred in recent years, not
                            even excepting the death of Stalin. He described the collective
                            dictatorship in the Soviet Union as finished. <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> followed these comments with a brief

                            of the official charges against “the rebels”. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> stated his inclination to believe that
                            in this extended contest <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s
                            intervention on the side of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had been decisive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s role, on the other hand,
                            appeared uncertain. Perhaps in the early stages of the debate he had
                            voted with the rebels against <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> would probably deem it advisable to keep
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> around for a while.
                            This would tend to soften the blow that a disgrace of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> would cause in countries like
                            India, which <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had recently
                                visited.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3"><persName corresp="#p_BNA1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> might be allowed to
                            retire quietly and be replaced by <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>. If this happened, <persName>Marshal
                                Konev</persName> would be the logical candidate to succeed <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> in the Ministry of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated his doubts that show trials of
                            the rebels were likely to be staged. Banishment or some kind of house
                            arrest was more likely than show trials.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> followed with what he described as the
                            tentative conclusions of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> as to
                            the meaning of these events, pointing out that as yet these conclusions
                            had not been coordinated within the intelligence community as a whole.
                            Firstly, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a dictator
                            would be dangerous and impulsive, though he may be restrained by
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>. Throughout his
                            career, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had shown
                            himself to be a shrewd opportunist. He favors co-existence, different
                            roads to socialism, reconciliation with Yugoslavia, and increased
                            contacts with other countries. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was likely to continue to follow these
                            policies in the future if not prevented by events beyond his
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the future policy of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> with regard to the Soviet satellites was hard to
                            analyze. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> stated the belief of <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> that these two individuals had
                            primarily been responsible for the job that had been done in Hungary. On
                            the other hand, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            recent statements would raise hopes in the satellites for a softer
                            Moscow line. This might raise such serious problems in the satellites
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will not dare to
                            relax Moscow’s strict control.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought it unlikely that these
                            recent events would produce much of a change in the Soviet position on
                            disarmament at London. It was conceivable, however, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> might make some concessions
                            in order to exhibit a victory for himself.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would be facing very severe
                            internal problems, particularly with respect to industrial
                            decentralization and agriculture. If these problems were not solved, the
                            consequences for <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could
                            be very serious. De-Stalinization is going on apace. The steam has gone
                            out of the fanatic ideological Communism of the past.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would like to
                            emphasize three vitally important questions: First, can Party careerists
                            really make the new industrial system work? Second, if the Party
                            careerists fail, can <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            save himself by adopting wholly new policies? Third, is the next great
                            step military dictatorship?</p>

                        <p>While the Soviet leadership changes could portend the emergence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> as a dictator in
                            the image of Stalin, there is no present evidence that the secret police
                            or the military are subordinate to him personally; or that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MAI1"
                                >Mikoyan</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> are ciphers within the Party. Counterbalancing
                            forces to one-man rule will probably be operative into the foreseeable
                            future despite the greater freedom which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> may enjoy in executing policy. The dangers
                            inherent in such rule of a miscalculation leading to hostilities thus do
                            not appear more pressing than heretofore.</p>
                        <p>The changes could also mean considerable enhancement of the power of the
                            military. In the absence of evidence that the military in fact seek an
                            independent power position, we interpret <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>’s elevation to the Party Presidium as a
                            recognition of influence he has exerted for some time over policy
                            formation rather than as a harbinger of vastly increased powers. The
                            military are nevertheless likely to serve as an important deterrent to a
                            resurgence of Stalinist-type rule; professionally they are also likely
                            to press for a continued preferential allocation of resources to
                            military and related industrial investment.</p>
                        <p>The changes could likewise affect internal stability and bloc solidarity,
                            both central to Soviet readiness and capability to initiate hostilities.
                            They now appear unlikely, however, to produce a decisive impact in
                            either respect. In the USSR the regime has not felt obliged to take
                            unusual security precautions, and any discontent in Party circles has
                            been muted by a massive propaganda campaign. <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150"
                                facs="0180"/>Much will depend on whether <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> ultimately abstains from the temptation to
                            widen the purge and whether he successfully implements the apparently
                            popular agricultural and housing policies with which he is identified.
                            As regards Soviet policy toward the bloc, the optimistic Polish

                            proved accurate. We believe that the USSR will continue to find it
                            virtually impossible to achieve a stable satellite policy through a
                            mixture of liberal and repressive measures. As a corollary, Eastern
                            Europe seems likely to remain a dubious Soviet asset in the event of
                            widespread hostilities.</p>
                        <p>In light of these considerations and Moscow’s current stress on
                            continuity of policy rather than dramatic change, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s elevation is unlikely to
                            entail any substantial modification of existing estimates as to the
                            likelihood of a Soviet resort to force.</p>

                                accurately after Beria expulsion in June 1953) was ad hoc working
                                relationship among members of Presidium based on agreement that
                                policy decisions would be reached by majority vote within Presidium,
                                disagreements among Presidium members were permitted and expected,
                                disagreements would be resolved within Presidium and above all not
                                by means of arrest, and “chairman of board” of Presidium would have
                                authority to lead but not to dictate and would not have power of
                                life and death over his colleagues. Under this arrangement,

                            <item>This working relationship (but not necessarily the institution of
                                collective leadership) has now broken down with expulsion of five of
                                original nine members of Presidium (excluding Beria). This creates
                                fluid political situation in Soviet Union with three likely
                                possibilities: (1) Establishment of absolute one-man rule by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, (2)
                                Continuance of previous collective rule by Presidium with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> pre-eminence as “first
                                among equals” strengthened, (3) Solution along lines of (2) but with
                                Central Committee achieving greater political power, particularly as
                                court of last resort in case of major policy disputes in Presidium.
                                If <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> were to seek
                                one-man rule, presence of following three factors would be important
                                for his success: breakdown of practice in Presidium of reaching
                                decisions by majority vote, establishment of personal control over
                                secret police, and ambition and will to become personal

                                        Presidium staffed with nine new members and presumably many

                                        Although entire question of personal loyalty among Soviet
                                        leaders is very obscure and frequently misleading (<persName

                                        significance for immediate future at least. For example, six
                                        members of Presidium (four of them new members) are Central

                            and hydrogen weapons, and on the other hand reiterates the Soviet claim
                            that they have more than once submitted concrete proposals for
                            reductions in armed forces and armaments and the prohibition of nuclear
                            weapons as well as cessation of tests. The West is charged not only with
                            not taking any practical steps in the field of disarmament, but also the
                            creation of all kinds of obstacles.</p>

                            that the United States and its partners not only reject the prohibition
                            of nuclear weapons, “but in fact do not want agreement on the

                            negative attitude on the part of the Western powers, “primarily the
                            USA,” the Soviet Government has been compelled to take all necessary
                            measures with the object of safeguarding the security of the Soviet
                            state. The statement concludes by asserting that the Soviet Government
                            will nevertheless continue persistently to press for agreement on
                            cessation of tests, prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the problem of
                            disarmament as a whole.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement was
                            apparently aimed at heightening the effect of the Soviet demand for
                            immediate cessation of or suspension of nuclear tests. It probably was
                            timed to set the stage for a major Soviet propaganda offensive on the
                            test issue in the forthcoming session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> General Assembly, where Moscow hopes to score major
                            propaganda gains. A Soviet move for an early recess in the London
                            disarmament talks and a transfer of discussions of the disarmament
                            problems to the General Assembly is therefore not to be excluded.</p>

                            the world, the Department of State requested for receipt not later than

                        <p>I give you below such comments as I can make from here. There is a vast
                            difference, as I have again learned, from being in daily touch with the
                            Soviet situation and attempting to work out some consecutive thoughts
                            when the information is intermittent and fragmentary.</p>
                        <p>While I certainly did not anticipate any such spectacular developments,
                            or at least not so soon, I have not found anything in the June events in
                            Moscow to change any of my basic thinking on Soviet developments. On the
                            contrary, I believe the manner in which this occurred demonstrated
                            possibly more than anything else that collective leadership was indeed a
                            reality and not a fiction. Had, as many people thought, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> been building his power
                            position to a point of absolute mastery there would have been no need
                            for a two-week fight including an eight-day Central Committee meeting
                            for him to put down the opposition. From all indications I got here, the
                            argument in the Presidium was real and not pro forma and I have yet to
                            receive any information which would indicate that police or other armed
                            force was used or threatened to bring about the final result. It seems
                            to have been a question of who had the majority where and when. It would
                            of course be folly to predict anything for the future, but I am by no
                            means certain that the expulsion of <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                            >Molotov</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KL1">Kaganovich</persName>
                            and, in a lesser level, <persName corresp="#p_SDT1">Shepilov</persName>
                            marks the end of a collective leadership and a return to one-man rule.
                            It might even mark a trend in the opposite direction since apparently K
                            had to bring the CC into the act which, so far as I am aware, is the
                            first time that it has been made the final arbitrator of a dispute of
                            this nature in the Presidium. It could therefore mean that in the future
                            the circle of power will be broadened from the Presidium to include
                            133-odd voting members of the CC. Consequently <pb n="158"

                            post-Stalin period.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the specific passages you cite, I am not sure that
                            Isaiah is right in presenting <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> vs K as a personal power struggle pure and
                            simple. This is of course possible, but I don’t think in the post-Stalin
                            Soviet set-up that this factor plays as great a part as it did in the
                            past. It would seem to be based on the assumption that there is one
                            position, i.e. First Secretary of the CC, which has so much power that
                            it is worth in itself struggling for and, as indicated above, the very
                            fact that this group could hope to succeed against K would seem to
                            indicate the position does not have any such power in itself. I would
                            therefore be inclined to put <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName> (although in a different context) in the policy
                            fight. At a certain point policy disputes, as in all governments and
                            particularly dictatorships, eventually end in a power struggle among the
                            disputants. I agree that you cannot organically list <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGM1">Malenkov</persName> among the “Old Guard” and
                            therefore his disagreements with K’s policies were probably of a
                            somewhat different nature than <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_KL1"
                                >Kaganovich</persName>’s. I am inclined to believe that all three
                            for different reasons saw in K’s <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi>
                            policies a real danger of loss of the collective political power of the
                            top leadership and being Marxists feared that economic decentralization
                            if pushed forward with the vigor which K usually throws into these
                            matters would inevitably lead to some form of loss of control at the
                            top. By that I do not mean revolution or violent overthrow but real
                            problems of maintaining a political monopoly in a few hands with a
                            certain degree of loss of control in economic matters. I’ll admit I’m
                            influenced by <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>’s ready and

                            why <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName> is still there and
                            the others are out.</p>
                        <p>Following along the same line I would be inclined to believe that neither
                            side planned this thing very carefully before the actual conflict. I
                            cannot believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> accompanied by Serov
                            would have spent a week in Finland just prior to the event if he had
                            planned a coup of this dimension. Conversely, given the experience in
                            conspiracy and general dirty work that all three of the opposition
                            leaders had it seems to me unlikely that they would have done such a
                            clumsy job if this had been a carefully planned coup timed to coincide
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s absence. I am of course
                            operating on very little evidence, but it seems to me that there was a
                            confluence of those who disagreed with K’s policies for <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0189"/>different reasons along about this time
                            over some question due to come up in the Presidium. Some of the
                            opposition to K’s policy, particularly on the part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> and to a somewhat less
                            publicized degree <persName corresp="#p_KL1">Kaganovich</persName>, have
                            been known for some time. <persName corresp="#p_MGM1"
                                >Malenkov</persName>’s exact role remains unclear but given the age
                            factor it is probable (and here Isaiah is right) that he was destined to
                            take the top slot if the opposition movement had been a success. There
                            were obviously many other factors besides economic decentralization
                            involved and I would be inclined to give some weight to a rather
                            frivolous one, namely that these three men who are rather serious and on
                            the whole sober individuals were really concerned at K’s freewheeling
                            tendency to make off the cuff remarks and probably even commit the group
                            by snap decisions, especially in the field of foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the sentence you quote in sub-paragraph (g) on
                                Hungary<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4"><p>Subparagraph (g) of the August
                                    9 memorandum of conversation with Berlin was quoted by <persName
                                        corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> as follows:</p>
                                <p>“ ‘He does not believe the Soviets will provoke the Poles if it
                                    can possibly be avoided and is convinced that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> cannot afford
                                    another Hungary which, in Berlin’s view, was a <hi rend="italic"
                                        >disaster</hi> for the Russians.’ [This continues to be my
                                    own view and most of the current Washington thinking is likewise
                                    generally in accord. However, there is an important difference
                                    of opinion as to the nature and extent of the ‘disaster’ for the
                                    Russians, some feeling that on balance Hungary has turned out to
                                    be a ‘victory’ for the Russians simply because in crushing the
                                    revolt they demonstrated their willingness and ability to do so
                                    and the ineffectuality of the West—both as applied to Hungary
                                    and to similar situations elsewhere.]” The bracketed note is
                                        <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName>’s.</p></note>
                            I am in full agreement. I feel that those who feel differently are
                            talking about a different matter. It is true that for the short run
                            Russian ability to crush ruthlessly revolt in the face of Western
                            inaction may have given them some prestige among Communist regimes in
                                <gloss target="#t_EE1">EE</gloss>, but I am sure even the Russians
                            do not consider that such a naked use of force in the long run is a
                            “victory”. Shooting people down has never been in history a final
                            solution and certainly the Hungarian events did not solve any of the
                            problems which the Russians face and will continue to face in my opinion
                            in maintaining these regimes in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the military, again pleading lack of knowledge, I have
                            seen nothing which would indicate that K’s victory was due to the
                            military as an independent cohesive force. It stands to reason if
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> had been against him
                            he would have had great difficulty in eliminating the others. It does
                            not follow that he is in any sense a prisoner of the military. On the
                            contrary, I agree with Isaiah that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> on the whole being somewhat of a pragmatist
                            probably agrees with most of K’s policies. I also agree that a military
                            dictatorship would be probable only in the event of an emergency so <pb
                                n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0190"/>great, either domestic or
                            foreign, i.e. war, which would threaten the regime. I cannot see any
                            reason why the Army as such, even assuming that distinct Army point of
                            view is possible, would wish to take over the direction of all Soviet
                            affairs except in the case of extreme necessity to preserve the
                            system.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your (d),<note n="5" xml:id="d75fn5">In point (d)
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> wrote that,
                                according to <persName corresp="#p_GWF1">George Kennan</persName>,
                                “it must have been quite a struggle and that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> won out at great cost,
                                probably committing himself on several issues to the military and
                                perhaps to others, possibly to the Central Committee as a
                                body.”</note> while there obviously was quite a struggle, I do not
                            believe that K has committed himself to any one faction but rather, as
                            indicated above, to the CC as a whole and then only in the sense that he
                            will be forced to keep his majority intact in that body. K’s position,
                            therefore, in my mind should not be compared to Stalin’s but in very
                            different circumstances more to Lenin’s and I believe that his future
                            depends in large measure on the success of his policies, primarily
                            internal, and to a lesser degree in the foreign field.</p>
                        <p>On your (e)<note n="6" xml:id="d75fn6">In point (e), <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> asked the following
                                question: “Recalling your statement that the Party would probably
                                lose importance with the implementation of the decentralization
                                program, would you feel that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                    >Khrushchev</persName>’s stress on the role of the party is more
                                leading from weakness than an assertion of strength. The bureaucrats
                                may be dispersed by the new program, but does this really break
                                their power?”</note> I still believe that the Party by the nature of
                            things will gradually lose out if the decentralization program is
                            carried forward seriously and I do not see in the June developments a
                            victory for the Party over the bureaucracy. As I may have mentioned
                            during the briefing at your place, the provincial levels of the Party
                            are considerably less impressive than the top leaders and are presumably
                            so regarded by the factory managers and economic powers there than in
                            Moscow. In other words, the bureaucrats, if such is the right word, will
                            have the real operational power in the economic regional set-up and will
                            probably be less disposed to listen to Party hacks at that level than
                            the Ministers were to the Presidium. It must be recalled in this
                            connection that the division between the Party <hi rend="italic"
                                >apparachi</hi> and the real technocrats is greater at the
                            provincial level than at the center where more often the top Ministers
                            are also members of the Presidium.</p>

                                        corresp="#p_WFG1">Wisner</persName> made the following
                                    comments:</p>
                                <p>“Certainly the ideology is not a matter of deep concern, but
                                    apparently they have to go through the motion of elections,
                                    parades, <hi rend="italic">agitprop</hi> sessions, etc., to keep
                                    the society functioning. ‘Carrots’ may be necessary, but is not
                                    at least the semblance of faith also needed? What would happen
                                    if the current apathy toward all this turned into disgust and
                                    revulsion?”</p></note> the role of ideology is such a slippery
                            one in Soviet affairs that it would take quite a dissertation to run
                            down all of its ramifications. I believe, however, that ideology played
                            a part in <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0191"/>the recent
                            developments, particularly the “different roads to socialism” concept,
                            not on grounds of ideological purity but on practical grounds of the
                            consequence of pursuing one or the other courses of action which in
                            Bolshevik history frequently are depicted in ideological terms. Ideology
                            has shown itself to be so flexible that without serious loss of power at
                            the top I would not believe for the foreseeable future that Soviet
                            leaders will have too much difficulty in finding the proper ideological
                            formula to deal with whatever policy they are pursuing and for that
                            reason will never run out of carrots. However, if disarray sets in at
                            the top and the process of spreading the power which, though it has not
                            gone very far has been a continuing factor since the death of Stalin,
                            gets to the point where the monolithic character of the regime is
                            impaired, the lack of convincing ideology could become extremely
                            important.</p>
                        <p>I realize the foregoing is very brief and I don’t know that there is much
                            point of my trying to look into a crystal ball from this distance.
                            However, going deeper into the matter I am inclined to regard what has
                            happened in the Soviet Union in June as a further manifestation of its
                            basic contradiction of which I have spoken before and that is the
                            contradiction between the social and economic changes in the Soviet
                            Union brought on by the process of industrialization and the antiquated
                            forms of political rule which were devised and perfected in quite
                            different circumstances. The story is not over and I think we will see
                            further developments, not necessarily in the near future, as a result of
                            this basic contradiction.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> explained the order in
                            which the various aspects of this item of the agenda would be presented
                            to the members of the Council. He then called on the Director of Central
                            Intelligence for a briefing on the Soviet earth satellite.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> stated that at
                            1930 hours on October 4 the Soviets had fired their earth satellite from
                            the Tyura Tam range. Its initial path followed the range, crossing
                            approximately over the range’s other end at Klyuchi. Two hours after the
                            successful orbiting of the earth satellite and after the second circuit
                            of the earth by the satellite, the Soviets announced their achievement.
                            This delay in the announcement was in line with the previous statements
                            of the Soviet Union that they would not announce an attempt to orbit
                            their satellite until they had been assured that the orbiting had been
                            successful. Moreover, all the indications available to the intelligence
                            community prior to the actual launching of the satellite pointed to the
                            fact that the Soviets were preparing to launch either an earth satellite
                            or an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then stated that the actual launching of
                            the earth satellite had not come as a surprise. Indeed as early as last
                            November the intelligence community had estimated that the Soviets would
                            be capable of launching an earth satellite any time after November
                            1957.</p>
                        <p>Information on the earth satellite itself remains rather sparse, but it
                            is believed to weigh between 165 and 185 pounds.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to state that the Vice President of the Soviet
                            Scientific Academy had informed Dr. Bronk that someone here had got a
                            decimal point out of place. (There seemed to be no inclination in the
                            Council to question the estimated weight as given by Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> continued by pointing out that the
                            Soviets had joined together their ICBM and earth satellite programs,
                            which fact helps to explain the speed of the Soviet launching of its
                            earth satellite. We do not as yet know if the satellite is sending out
                            encoded messages. Furthermore, we must expect additional launchings of
                            Soviet earth satellites during the International Geophysical Year. The
                            Soviets have said that they would launch between six and 13 such
                            satellites.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then turned to the world reaction to the
                            Soviet achievement. He first pointed out that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had moved all <pb n="163"
                                xml:id="pg_163" facs="0193"/>his propaganda guns into place. The
                            launching of an earth satellite was one of a trilogy of propaganda
                            moves, the other two being the announcement of the successful testing of
                            an ICBM and the recent test of a large-scale hydrogen bomb at Novaya
                                Zemlya.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">See <ref target="#d73">Document
                                    73</ref>. On September 24, the Soviet Government announced that
                                nuclear tests were being conducted in connection with army and navy
                                combat training.</note> Incidentally, added Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, …. Moreover, there had been another
                            Soviet test late last night, also at Novaya Zemlya, ….</p>
                        <p>Larded in with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            propaganda statements had been a number of interesting remarks, such as
                            the one in which <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            consigned military aircraft to museums in the future. With respect to
                            this remark, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that U.S.
                            intelligence had not observed as many Soviet heavy bombers on airfields
                            as had been expected. This raised the question as to whether the Soviets
                            are in the process of de-emphasizing the role of the heavy bomber. There
                            had been no clear verdict yet by the intelligence community on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought that there was no doubt that in
                            gearing up all this propaganda of recent days and weeks, the Soviets had
                            had an eye to the situation in the Middle East, and wished to exert the
                            maximum influence they could summon on that situation. Much of the
                            Soviet propaganda comment is following closely the original Soviet boast
                            relating their scientific accomplishments to the effectiveness of the
                            Communist social system. The target for this particular thrust, thought
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, was evidently the underdeveloped
                            nations in the world. He informed members of the Council that he had
                            copies of an <gloss target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss> summary of Soviet
                                comment,<note n="4" xml:id="d76fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            which were available to any who wished to have them.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communist reaction was to declare quickly that the launching
                            of the earth satellite was proof of Soviet military and scientific
                            supremacy over the United States. Maximum play on this theme was being
                            provided in all the Soviet satellites.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> touched on the reactions in
                            Western Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. He concluded his remarks by
                            emphasizing that the Soviet Union was making a major propaganda effort
                            which was exerting a very wide and deep impact.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow comments by Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles and others
                            on the United States earth satellite program; for text, see <ref
                                target="frus1955-57v11#pg_758">volume XI, page 758</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then called on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> for an appraisal of
                            the foreign policy implications for U.S. security of the successful
                            launching of the Soviet satellite. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName> initially stated that <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164"
                                facs="0194"/>it was extremely difficult to make such an assessment
                            because there was such a mass of information pouring into the Department
                            of State. While there had been insufficient time to analyze this intake,
                            there were already some indications of the serious effects of the Soviet
                            success which we hope to be able to counteract.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> read
                            selected quotations to illustrate his point, with particular reference
                            to Turkey, Morocco, and the Philippines. He also pointed out the
                            probable repercussions of the Soviet success in the United Nations. The
                            United States may now encounter much greater difficulty in defending its
                            disarmament position.</p>
                        <p>By and large, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName>, the reaction of our allies had been pretty firm
                            and good, though even the best of them require assurance that we have
                            not been surpassed scientifically and militarily by the USSR. The
                            neutralist countries are chiefly engaged in patting themselves on the
                            back and insisting that the Soviet feat proves the value and the wisdom
                            of the neutralism which these countries have adopted.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>
                            described the first foreign policy reactions as “pretty somber ”. The
                            United States will have to do a great deal to counteract them and,
                            particularly, to confirm the existence of our own real military and
                            scientific strength.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> enlarged somewhat
                            on the repercussions in the United Nations. He believed it was yet too
                            soon to measure these repercussions with any assurance, but already the
                            first surprise was settling down and the diplomats in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> have begun to realize that the
                            fundamentals of the world situation have not been changed—namely, that
                            the capability for mutual annihilation still exists. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> doubted whether there would be
                            any quick shifts among <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then called on Mr.
                                <persName>Larson</persName>, who said that he was hesitant to say
                            what he was going to say because he was not sure that he really believed
                            it. He then went on to say that while we could not permit ourselves to
                            be panicked by the Soviet achievement, he did wonder whether our U.S.
                            plans were now adequate with regard to the next great break-through. If
                            we lose repeatedly to the Russians as we have lost with the earth
                            satellite, the accumulated damage would be tremendous. We should
                            accordingly plan, ourselves, to accomplish some of the next great
                            break-throughs first—for example, the achievement of a manned satellite,
                            or getting to the moon. Do we have any such plans, asked Mr. Larson. If
                            not, our people should begin to think about them.</p>
                        <p>The President replied to Mr. Larson by stating that while he could hardly
                            quarrel with Mr. Larson’s conclusions if the Soviets were to win every
                            time, the fact remained that the United States <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0195"/>couldn’t possibly set up a whole vast
                            scientific program of basic research in areas about which we don’t know
                            anything, and then attempt to outdo the Russians in each aspect of such
                            a program. We must, above all, still seek a military posture that the
                            Russians will respect.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> whether it was possible to provide estimates of
                            the amounts of money allocated to basic research by the United States in
                            comparison with the USSR. [Name deleted] answering for Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, could not give a clear response, though
                            he could not say that the Russians had put in more resources than we
                            have. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that at least the Soviets
                            have concentrated more heavily on the guided missiles field than we
                            have, ever since 1945. The President, agreeing with Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, pointed out that the United States had
                            not made any all-out effort in the field of ballistic missiles until
                            after the Killian Committee had submitted its report to the National
                            Security Council.<note n="5" xml:id="d76fn5">Reference is to the Killian
                                report of February 14, 1955.</note> He added that of course the
                            Soviets were bound to be ahead of the United States in certain fields
                            and in certain discoveries.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President warned the Council that we must be prepared for the
                            fact that Congress would insist on examining in great detail what we
                            have been doing in the missiles field. In the course of such an
                            examination they are certain to ask the question which he had just
                            put—as to the relative amounts which the United States and the USSR had
                            allocated to their respective missiles programs. Accordingly, we must be
                            prepared to answer such a question.</p>
                        <p>After Mr. Larson had reiterated his plea for planning for a U.S. win in
                            the next great break-through, Dr. Bronk commented that, in line with Mr.
                            Larson’s views, the United States could, if it chose, give much greater
                            emphasis to the spectacular achievements that we have made in the
                            scientific field—for example, we could stress our vast achievements in
                            the field of cancer research. Regrettably, it was hard to get the press
                            to take an interest in these achievements. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> suggested that we might perhaps
                            have announced the successful launching of a U.S. missile with a range
                            of 3500 miles. Secretary Quarles pointed out that the Operations
                            Coordinating Board was presently engaged in examining our public
                            relations policies with respect to our missiles programs. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> cautioned that we
                            should not permit ourselves to become hysterical about the Soviet
                            achievement.</p>

                        <p>339. In view propaganda being made by Communists in relation to launching
                            of satellite and their effort to stir up somewhat panicky reactions, we
                            think it useful give you for background our estimate of situation.</p>
                        <p>Soviet satellite is of military importance only in sense that advancement
                            of science in long run contributes to military technology. While Soviet
                            satellite does not meet all of the scientific objectives, its values are
                            scientific rather than military. Efforts to capitalize on Soviet
                            satellite for cold war purposes should be discounted. Our own satellite
                            program has, from start, been directed toward scientific purposes. You
                            will have noted the President’s statement October 9 that he “considers
                            our country’s satellite program well designed and properly scheduled to
                            achieve the scientific purposes for which it was initiated”<note n="2"

                        <p>Soviets exploited the German assets, human and material, which they
                            removed after World War II from Pennemunde, Germany and appear to have
                            given this line of development both in its ballistic missile and
                            satellite applications the highest priority of their military work over
                            past twelve years. In vital air/atomic area we believe that Soviet Union
                            now is, and for some time will continue to be, in a position of relative
                            inferiority. From Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s recent speeches as quoted in press, and
                            particularly his statement that “fighter and bomber planes can be put in
                            museums”, it would appear that he is trying to cover up on a relatively
                            weak long-range bomber position. By attempting to jump long-range bomber
                            stage he would avoid bearing at same time expense of a large bomber and
                            missile development. It is unlikely however that he will have for some
                            time an atomic delivery capability in the very long-range missiles which
                            would be an adequate counterpart for the large number of bombers capable
                            of reaching Soviet Union now in possession of United States.</p>
                        <p>We believe Soviet propaganda is in large measure designed to cover up
                            this period of relative weakness which may exist for several years. Even
                            if Soviet claims about long-range missiles are <pb n="168"
                                xml:id="pg_168" facs="0198"/>fully substantiated we believe that
                            time difference between their operational capability in this area and
                            our own will be minor and that at least in meantime we will have a
                            distinct superiority with our long-range bomber force.</p>
                        <p>You should not feel or allow anyone to feel that United States is in a
                            position of relative weakness. It is quite the contrary. Our foreign
                            policy should reflect the basic sense of confidence which we feel in the
                            military posture of our country.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that proposals of the four Western Powers regarding
                            control of sending objects through outer space as part of a disarmament
                            agreement were introduced in London in August. These proposals thus
                            antedate announcement of Soviet earth satellite and are not a response
                            to it.</p>

                            providing a summary of important facts in development by United States

                            possible to orbit a mass of this size with the rockets currently
                            estimated for the Soviet 700-mile missile. It would not be necessary to
                            have higher thrust rockets, such as those used in an ICBM, but the USSR
                            could have used such rockets. A feasible design for Sputnik could be
                            directly adapted to a surface-to-surface missile capable of sending a
                            sizeable warhead 3,000–3,500 miles.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent Soviet earth satellites are expected to be heavier and more
                            instrumental. In March 1957, the <gloss target="#t_IAC1">IAC</gloss>
                            estimated that a satellite vehicle possessing substantial reconnaissance
                            capabilities of military value probably could be orbited by the USSR in
                            the period 1963-1965. There has not yet been any change in this estimate
                            in the intelligence community, but I venture to say that if a second
                            Sputnik is orbited in the near future, this date might well be 1960.</p>

                        <p>On October 26, <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> announced that
                            Marshal <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Georgi K. Zhukov</persName> had been
                            replaced as Minister of Defense by Marshal Rodion Ya. Malinovsky. The
                            announcement provided no other details.</p>
                        <p>The initial appraisal by the Central Intelligence Agency of <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s removal was in a memorandum
                            from the Assistant Director of the Office of Current Intelligence to the
                            Deputy Director for Intelligence, dated October 26, in which he
                            concluded that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s removal
                            was likely intended to allow him to concentrate more on political
                            matters, that his political stature had not been reduced, and <pb
                                n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0200"/>that he probably would continue
                            as a leading member of the Soviet hierarchy. The memorandum concluded,
                            however, that “the possibility cannot be excluded at this time that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> was removed because of

                            governmental echelons, recent emphasis in military press on role of
                            party as leader and organizer of Soviet Armed Forces may reflect one of
                            issues over which there was disagreement in top Soviet circles.
                            Beginning with <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi> editorial on October 16
                            which contended that “in leadership of Communist Party is main source of
                            strength of our armed forces” and claimed that Soviet Army and Navy were
                            “indebted” for World War II victories to Communist Party, military press
                            has repeatedly referred to guidance and supervision of party over
                            military (Weeka 42 and 43). On October 25 and 26 subject was treated
                            especially heavily; <hi rend="italic">Soviet Fleet</hi> editorial 25th
                            entitled “In Leadership of Party is Source of Power of Soviet Army and
                            Fleet,” <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi> editorial 26 dealt with same
                            subject as did <hi rend="italic">Soviet Aviation</hi> article on same
                            day. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> editorial today (only newspaper
                            published on Monday) which entitled “Indivisible Unity of Party and
                            People” repeats theme that “because of leadership of Communist Party and
                            its Central Committee Soviet people and their Armed Forces won … <note
                                n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">All ellipses are in the source text.</note>
                            victory in fatherland war.”</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0201"/>
                        <p>Theme of party supervision of military, of course, is not new. However,
                            quantity of [garble] subject since mid-October has been stepped up
                            impressively and apparently is not due solely to propaganda preparations
                            for forthcoming celebration. This evident from recent treatment in
                            military press of subject of improving “party-political work” in armed
                            forces, particularly in <hi rend="italic">Soviet Fleet</hi> editorial of
                            26th. Attributing to party leadership “chief source” of might of Soviet
                            Armed Forces, editorial stated that in solving problems facing Soviet
                            Armed Forces “important role belongs to military councils, political
                            organs and party organizations along with one-man commanders.” Editorial
                            then stated that “instructions” to party organizations in armed forces
                            (which Party Central Committee issued last April although they first
                            mentioned in press in May) “obliged political organs and party
                            organizations … to delve actively into all sides of military
                            preparation, military discipline and indoctrination of personnel, to
                            uncover on basis of criticism and self-criticism all shortcomings in
                            instruction and indoctrination of troops, to assist commanders to adopt
                            in time measures for eliminating defects hindering improvement of
                            military preparedness of units, ships and subunits.” Nevertheless, this
                            editorial and one in <hi rend="italic">Soviet Aviation</hi> on 25th
                            stipulated that “orders and instructions of commanders” were not to be
                            criticized, which had been made clear last May when military press first
                            discussed Central Committee’s “instructions.” That there were
                            differences in views, however, over scope of responsibility of political
                            workers in Armed Forces was apparent in remarks of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Soviet Fleet</hi> editorial that some party organizations were
                            “weakly” studying problems affecting military training and discipline of
                            troops because of “harmful” opinion that political workers should “not
                            deal with questions of military preparation.” This was also apparent in
                            editorial’s remarks that “there still are individual Communists who
                            evaluate criticism of defects in instruction and indoctrination of
                            troops as undermining their authority, interference in service functions
                            of commander. This is mistaken, Philistine understanding of
                            criticism.”</p>
                        <p>From above it would appear that there has been considerable difference of
                            opinion over extent of supervision political organs and party
                            organizations would exercise over activities of military commanders and
                            their troops. Obviously line cannot be sharply drawn between criticism
                            of orders of commanders and criticism of training and indoctrination of
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>Presumably military commanders would be inclined to interpret latter
                            criticism as criticism of their “orders” while party officials would
                            tend to interpret criticism of commanders’ orders as criticism of troop
                            training. Thus while principle of one-man command presumably basis for
                            organizing structure of Soviet military system, it <pb n="172"
                                xml:id="pg_172" facs="0202"/>in great danger of being vitiated by
                            party interference. This could have been one of principal issues over
                            which there were differences.</p>
                        <p>One paragraph in <hi rend="italic">Soviet Fleet</hi> editorial of 26th
                            may have been pointedly directed at <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>. It emphasized how a Communist must be “modest”,
                            must not “exalt personal self,” and must not only teach masses but must
                            be able to learn from them. Paragraph then asserted “Each member and
                            candidate member of party, no matter what post he occupies, must have
                            these valuable qualities”. This is remindful of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Pravda</hi> July 3 assertion immediately prior to announcement of
                            action against “anti-party group” that there is no one in party,
                            regardless of how high his post, who is above party criticism.</p>

                            last or next-to-last page of all principal Moscow newspapers, including
                            military ones. This obvious effort to play down return of <persName

                            have been here from commenting in most cases on Soviet developments, in
                            part because I profoundly believe that our people in Moscow on the spot
                            are in the best position to do so without views being submitted from all
                            quarters of the globe. In addition, while I have not lost my interest I
                            have lost touch with Soviet developments on a day-to-day basis. However,
                            in this particular case I am very glad to give you my comments,
                            primarily because, particularly after Geneva, I had considerable
                            opportunities for informal talks with <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> and formed, insofar as it is possible with any
                            Soviet official, some rather definite conclusions as to his character
                            and cast of mind.</p>
                        <p>I shall, therefore, start with this aspect of the matter which will help
                            to explain my subsequent remarks. <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> in my opinion <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175"
                                facs="0205"/>above all is a Soviet patriot. He is a Bolshevik and as
                            Hungary showed he is capable of ruthless and even brutal action if he
                            feels the interests of the Soviet Union are involved. Ideologically,
                            while not questioning the general premises of Marxism and Leninism, I
                            would say his interest in this field, and hence in communism in other
                            countries, is distinctly subordinate to his preoccupation with the
                            security of the Soviet Union and by analogy of the whole Communist
                            bloc.</p>
                        <p>On military matters from several conversations I am convinced that he is
                            extremely sober and realistic in his evaluation of modern warfare and I
                            would imagine has an extremely accurate comprehension of the correlation
                            of forces between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Although primarily and
                            principally a military man, he is at the same time a party member and
                            has been since 1918. I am reasonably certain that he has no personal
                            political ambitions and seriously doubt if he ever had any intention of
                            making Soviet Armed Forces supreme as against the party. For these
                            reasons I cannot see him engaged in the intrigues of power struggle for
                            his own advancement. However, given his preoccupation of the
                            effectiveness of the Soviet armed forces he would in my opinion
                            fearlessly and bluntly resist any attempt to re-establish political
                            commissar system in the form that existed under Stalin. He would
                            probably be prepared to work closely with the political sections of the
                            Red Army in the indoctrination of troops in ideology and in support of
                            current Soviet policies, but would oppose the reinstitution of a system
                            of Party spies and informers in the officer corps of the armed forces.
                            His chief reason I would imagine would certainly not be any basic
                            hostility to the party as such but rather his conviction based on past
                            experience that any such system would be demoralizing to the officer
                            corps and would reduce the military efficiency of the forces. It is
                            entirely possible, therefore, that his dismissal arose from his
                            opposition to attempts by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and party people to reintroduce a full blown
                            political commissar system in the Soviet Armed Forces. However, given
                            the timing of this crisis I am inclined to believe that other elements,
                            possibly more important to us, may have entered the picture. If it had
                            been a purely internal matter in the traditional party/military
                            jockeying on the subject of political commissars, it would hardly seem
                            wise for either side to press it to a crisis at a time when
                            international tension in the Middle East and U.S./USSR confrontation is
                            probably more acute than at any time since Korea. If this crisis should
                            explode into war dismissal of the most respected and competent military
                            leader who in addition enjoys great personal popularity would be an act
                            of unparalleled folly by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> and company. Even if Soviet intention is to
                            score a diplomatic triumph in the Middle East it would certainly have
                            been <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>wiser for the same reason
                            to have awaited the end of this particular crisis.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I am inclined to the view that a difference of opinion as to
                            Soviet foreign military policy is likewise involved. Given <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s temperament and realism I
                            believe it a safe bet that he views with concern, if not with real
                            alarm, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s reckless
                            threats and saber rattling. With a more professional understanding of
                            the present correlation of military forces in the world he may have been
                            constantly opposed <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in
                            the development of his Middle East policy and the risks that it most
                            certainly involves. In my opinion, therefore, the latter consideration,
                            possibly in conjunction with a latent dispute between party control and
                            military efficiency, is a most likely explanation of the present
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>I entirely agree that the <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s promotion is
                            untenable and have thought so from the moment his release from Defense
                            duty was announced. If promotion had been in the cards standard Soviet
                            practice would have been to announce his promotion and his departure
                            from Defense as a consequence.</p>
                        <p>If information concerning a CC meeting is accurate (although according to
                            the evening press here <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            denied it at Turkish reception), this would appear to indicate <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and his supporters have
                            encountered real opposition to the demotion and possible elimination of
                                <persName>Marshal Zhukov</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s remark that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> would receive a new position according to his
                            experience and qualifications is of course meaningless as to the nature
                            of any new job he may have. It, however, may be an indication that
                            because of opposition in the Army and even within the party <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> cannot just be dismissed out of
                            hand and he may have to be given some face-saving job.</p>
                        <p>There is yet no indication that I have seen as to whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> is to be likewise removed from
                            the Presidium which is of course a key point. If present crisis,
                            however, results in total elimination of <persName>Marshal
                                Zhukov</persName> from high Soviet councils I think it is a most
                            disturbing development as I can see no one in the immediate entourage of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> who would be
                            either in a position or have sufficient courage to act as a sober
                            restraining factor on <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                            >Khrushchev</persName>’s tendency to gamble.</p>
                        <p>If you see no objection I would appreciate this being repeated to Moscow

                        <p>The Director of Central Intelligence sketched the background and
                            developments preceding the replacement of <persName>Marshal
                                Zhukov</persName> as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. Just
                            before his journey to Yugoslavia, <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> had seen <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in the Crimea, and apparently all had gone
                            smoothly at this meeting. <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>
                            was nine days in Yugoslavia and eight days in Albania. These facts
                            raised certain questions. If there is as much danger of war as <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> has lately been implying,
                            why was <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> permitted to be
                            away from Moscow for a period of three weeks? Were plots against
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> being hatched during
                            this time? Was Marshal Rokossovsky sent to a provincial military command
                            in order to get him out of Moscow when <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> was removed from his job?</p>
                        <p>Apparently when <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> returned to
                            Moscow on October 26, he had no expectation that anything would happen
                            to him. He immediately went into a series of meetings the outcome of
                            which is even yet not known. Then came <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s announcement of <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName>’s relief from the Defense Ministry.</p>
                        <p>A meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party has evidently
                            been going on for several days. We do not know what has occurred in this
                            meeting. Perhaps <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may
                            originally have offered <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>
                            some other high-level job, but one remote from the Army, where <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> feared the power of
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>. Apparently <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> did not react calmly to this
                            proposal. What has actually happened to him physically since that time,
                            we again do not know.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> would have
                            preferred to settle this matter quietly and without fuss. It appears
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s dismissal has been
                            instrumental in causing Marshal Tito to decline to go to Moscow for the
                            November 7 celebrations. Meanwhile, the press of the Soviet Union is
                            emphasizing the superiority of the Communist Party over the Army.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> may not have
                            sufficiently realized this point, so that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> felt the time had come to put the military in
                            its place of subordination. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> has been an outspoken advocate of the right of
                            military commanders to control <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"
                            />their troops, and to this end has reduced the power of the political
                            commissars in the Soviet armed forces.</p>
                        <p>We have been hearing that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>
                            is to get another job, but the censorship has been stricter than ever in
                            recent hours, and we do not know anything further about this job. It
                            would seem, however, that the last die has not been cast. Will the
                            Soviet Army take <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s
                            dismissal lying down? It is too early to predict an answer to this
                            question. We may get the decision today as to what <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> will finally do. In the

                            respect and esteem in which <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1"
                                >Zhukov</persName> was held by the public at large will add to the

                            able effectively to express itself, it will make more difficult
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s efforts to
                            increase the efficiency of the Soviet system by evoking enthusiasm and
                            belief of the people in the system. The extent to which the leadership
                            and propaganda apparatus has been employed in stating the regime’s case
                            indicates the seriousness with which the question of public opinion is
                            regarded. This was also apparent in the charge the CC resolution made
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s role in World War
                            II was being exaggerated and in <persName corresp="#p_KIS1"
                                >Konev</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> article which
                            minimized <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s wartime
                            exploits and pointed up his shortcomings. At the same time <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Konev</persName> supplied support for the claim
                            that a personality cult was being developed around <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>, citing as one of the facts the
                            painting of him on a white charger overlooking the burning Reichstag
                            which was hung at his order in the Museum of the Soviet Army. This and
                            the quotation in the <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> editorial from
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s recantation
                            accepting the Party’s charges as just are intended to undermine the
                            basis of <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>’s appeal to the
                            masses and to reduce the area of latent opposition the anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> move may engender.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most striking point in the decree of the Central Committee is
                            the statement that <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> “showed
                            himself an unsound political figure, inclined to adventurism, both in
                            his understanding of the most important tasks of the foreign policy of
                            the Soviet Union as well as in the direction of the Ministry of
                            Defense.” This lends credence to the view that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> opposed <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in the field of Foreign
                            Affairs. The Syrian problem would certainly seem to be the most likely
                            issue despite the strong statements made on this subject by <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> in Albania. There are of course
                            other possibilities. For example, his prolonged stay in Albania may have
                            been accounted for by his taking a hand in the Yugoslav-Albania problem.
                            We have also been disturbed by the possibility that recent developments
                            in Berlin and the recognition of East Germany by Yugoslavia<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d84fn3">Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations with

                            Soviet policy in that area. The Syrian policy seems a more likely issue,
                            however, since from his many statements on this question we know that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0210"/>was personally involved in
                            building up the crisis and it is in this area that the Soviet armed
                            forces would be most handicapped in conducting limited military
                            operations should the issue be forced. Whatever the immediate incident
                            that may have precipitated a showdown, however, the basic factor was
                            clearly the Party’s concern that its control over the military was not
                            secure. This rivalry between the party and the armed forces as
                            institutions rather than a personal fear on the part of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> that his leadership of the
                            Party was threatened by <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName>
                            was, in my opinion, the issue.</p>
                        <p>The removal of <persName corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> leaves no
                            strong figure in the Presidium, with the possible exception of the
                            ubiquitous <persName corresp="#p_MAI1">Mikoyan</persName>, who could be
                            expected to exert a strong restraining influence on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s impetuousness. This
                            development can only be deplored from our point of view. For the time
                            being however, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            sensitivity to public opinion and the knowledge that by moving so
                            quickly on so many fronts he has created a formidable latent opposition,
                            may have a sobering influence. The charge against <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZGK1">Zhukov</persName> of developing a cult of
                            personality may for the time being act as a check on a similar build-up
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, the logic of the
                            Soviet system and his own personality, however, appear to be pushing
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> toward one-man
                            dictatorship but whether he can successfully carry out this role remains

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> reported that
                            he was inclined to believe that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> had proposed a summit meeting and that “this

                                >Khrushchev</persName> expects an early acceptance.” <persName

                            the Soviet Government hoped to achieve by such a meeting and his belief
                            that the United States Government’s reply should be “along the line that
                            we are prepared to participate in high level discussions at any time

                            <item>Following its announcement of Sputnik I on October 14 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">4</hi>], Soviet propaganda emphasized the
                                satellite’s scientific aspects but relied for the most part on free
                                world sources to bring home its military implications. The rest of
                                the Bloc elaborated both themes in volume. The second launching
                                produced a smaller volume of propaganda along similar lines.</item>

                            <item>Outside the Bloc, Sputnik I tended to remove misconceptions about
                                Soviet technological capabilities and to confirm its temporary ICBM
                                lead. The resulting widespread concern was deepened by Sputnik II,
                                which caused many to believe that the gap between the US and the
                                USSR was wider than first realized. Although these views were
                                tempered by the general belief that the US will match the USSR
                                achievement in reasonable time, Sputnik II raised at least some
                                doubts as to US ability to catch up quickly.</item>

                            <item>The USSR’s prestige has risen substantially and the US has
                                suffered a serious, although not decisive, setback. World opinion
                                tends to hold that the sputniks per se have not altered the
                                strategic balance of forces in the short run, since Soviet ICBMs are
                                not yet thought to be in mass production. Nevertheless, some new

                                Soviet foreign policy pronouncements and increased credibility may

                            <item>Observers throughout the world agree that beyond the immediate
                                future US ability to match the Soviet advance is crucial and that a
                                significant lag would have far-reaching effects. In Western Europe,
                                particularly, this has led to the conviction that <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> efforts must be strengthened,
                                collaboration increased, and US leadership revitalized. In addition,
                                in Europe and leading countries elsewhere, the sputniks gave new
                                urgency to problems of strategy and military planning arising from
                                the advent of ballistic missiles.</item>

                            <item>The USSR will make further intensive propaganda efforts to exploit
                                the situation but probably does not believe that it is justified in
                                radically altering its foreign policy for the present. Nevertheless,
                                the Kremlin will experience some gain in confidence, may expect to
                                seize political opportunities at less risk, and will exploit any
                                sign of US failure to meet the challenge.</item>

                            <item>Free world opinion will be influenced by the Soviet achievement
                                for some time to come. In Europe, pressure for increased US, US–UK
                                and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> effort and collaboration
                                will continue. At the same time, further stimulus will have been
                                given to development of European advanced weapon capability, partly
                                because of continuing anxiety that the US may gradually withdraw
                                once it has an operational ICBM. Fear that the US will enter
                                bilateral negotiations with the USSR will also continue to be felt.
                                Elsewhere in the world no major realignments seem probable in the
                                short run, although attitudes will be influenced by progress in the
                                weapons race. The status of US bases is for the present not likely

                            within USSR and bloc.</p>
                        <p>Embassy believes Sputnik undoubtedly source pride to all elements Soviet
                            society particularly intelligentsia. Regime attempt to equate communism
                            and progress enhanced and its prestige probably raised, while disquiet
                            certain professional and intellectual groups perhaps somewhat mollified.
                            Although military angles not focus of principal stress, national sense
                            of security also probably increased. However, Embassy contacts, though
                            limited, indicate ordinary citizens remain more interested in bread and
                            butter measures. Moreover, Zhukov Ouster and way it was handled probably
                            vitiated in short run some psychological advantages of Sputnik and
                            pointed up gap between arbitrary and antiquated political system and
                            ultra-modern technological achievements.</p>
                        <p>Finally Sputnik not unalloyed gain for intelligentsia, since though
                            already high status of science boosted further, there are indications
                            regime may seek use Sputnik success to demand greater exertions for
                            comparable triumphs in other fields. In bloc, Soviets are obviously
                            using Sputnik as symbol of growth Soviet power which should be proof to
                            peoples of bloc that communism is irreversible. Hopes for liberation
                            which already dimmed by passage of time in general and by Hungary in
                            particular presumably will be further reduced. Repeated demands by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> (who will now seem
                            to be leading from own “position of strength”) that West recognize
                            status quo in Europe will have some effect even if West maintains
                            silence or gives verbal refusal.</p>
                        <p>On basis apparent Soviet analysis of new international opportunities now
                            open to USSR, Embassy believes Dept estimate fails give sufficiently
                            high rating to impact, especially in uncommitted areas, of present
                            situation. This is one in which the USSR, after giving general
                            impression of parity with US in nuclear field, has gone on dramatically
                            to take stance of world leader in vitally important and
                            imagination-catching field of future like rocketry, leaving US in
                            position of catching up in science and technology which hitherto assumed
                            US strong point. Embassy agrees that US launching satellite and ICBM
                            might lessen impact, but there is no reason expect USSR rest on present
                            laurels and meanwhile USSR has gone long way to <pb n="186"
                                xml:id="pg_186" facs="0216"/>establish picture of itself (which it
                            is assiduously promoting) as world power on par with and conceivably
                            superior to US. In this connection, Sputniks have given much greater
                            retroactive impact to ICBM announcement, a fact acknowledged but also
                            underplayed in estimate.</p>
                        <p>Immediate consequences appear to be Soviet effort to inflate pressure for
                            big power talks, and possibly increased Soviet belief that US and West
                            ready or can be forced discuss disarmament on Soviet terms, admit Soviet
                            role in Near East, and accept postwar Communist conquests in Eastern
                            Europe and Far East. Moreover, since USSR is combining its greatly
                            increased prestige and enhanced political stature with continued foreign
                            assistance program in key uncommitted areas, it can be expected that
                            tendency to accept Soviet help and expanded trade (with all
                            possibilities of penetration thus implied) will grow as target nations

                            for industrialization— especially if US programs should become
                            inadequate. With regard to section roman numeral IV B 7 and 8, it is
                            true that Sputnik–ICBM does not increase danger of devastation

                        <p>From November 14 to 16, a meeting was held in Moscow of representatives
                            from Albania, Hungary, North Vietnam, East Germany, Communist China,
                            North Korea, Outer Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia,
                            Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. On November 21, a declaration signed
                            by representatives from all the countries except Yugoslavia was
                            published. It reaffirmed the revolutionary nature of the international
                            Communist movement and Moscow’s direction of the movement. For text of

                            following remarks during his briefing on significant world developments

                                    November 16. The fact that the communiqué had only been issued
                                    yesterday (November 21) indicated that there had been

                                    pointed out that it was neither very ringing nor very important.

                        <p>The Secretary alluded to the discussion he had with Senator
                                <persName>Fulbright</persName> the previous Tuesday at the
                            bipartisan meeting <note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">No record of this
                                meeting, December 3, has been found.</note> and said that he would
                            like to explain his views regarding the Soviet Union in somewhat greater
                            detail. The Secretary said he did not believe he would convert the
                            Senator to his thinking but he hoped that as a result the Senator would
                            have a better understanding of his viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought we had a three-fold task in connection with
                            meeting the threat of the Soviet Union. The Secretary did not for a
                            minute underestimate the military strength of the Soviet Union. The
                            first requirement was to have a military capability which would deter
                            the Soviet Union from initiating a hot war. The <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0218"/>second task was to be able to counter
                            probing or “nibbling” operations by the Soviet Union in the form of
                            small-scale aggressions around the periphery of the Sino-Soviet bloc The
                            third task was to insure the economic progress of the underdeveloped
                            areas in order to prevent the Soviets from taking over these areas by
                            subversion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the second and third tasks were heavily
                            dependent on the Mutual Security Program.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if we could succeed in these three objectives he
                            believed that there eventually would be a change in the Soviet Union
                            which would transform it into the kind of nation with whom we could have
                            good relations in normal international society. He said he was not
                            speaking of a revolution but of evolution. The Secretary said that it
                            had been the experience of history that totalitarian regimes which
                            existed on repressive measures in regard to its own people could only
                            survive as long as they continued to achieve victories abroad. If they
                            were denied such victories they were inevitably forced to release these
                            repressive measures, become less authoritarian, and yield to the
                            internal wishes of their people. The Secretary pointed out that when
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> was asked why it
                            took so long for the Soviets to do anything about the evils of
                            Stalinism, the reply had been that it was impossible to do anything as
                            long as Stalin was achieving great successes abroad. The Secretary
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> today
                            needed these victories as much as Stalin had in the past. The Secretary
                            pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            many troubles at home. He alluded to the unrest in the satellites, the
                            abandonment of the five-year plan, and the turnover in leadership. He
                            thought the evolutionary process was even now beginning, pointing out
                            that Russia was no longer ruled by one man or even by the Presidium but
                            rather the locus of power appeared to be now in the larger Central
                            Committee. (At this point Senator <persName>Fulbright</persName>
                            interjected to say that it looked to him as though the power had
                            descended for a time to the Central Committee but was rapidly ascending
                            again to one man.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed that he could not determine whether the change he
                            predicted in the Soviet Union would be in five, twenty-five or fifty
                            years but he was convinced that if the Soviets could be denied external
                            victories that the change would inevitably come.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Fulbright</persName> said that he was less optimistic
                            than the Secretary in his appraisal of the future course of the Soviet
                            Union. He said that this evolutionary process might take place some day
                            but he did not think it was enough of a certainty for us to base our
                            policy upon it. He was, in fact, very discouraged about the
                            possibilities of dislodging the Communist leadership from power in any
                            foreseeable period of time. They had control of all the political, <pb
                                n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0219"/>military, economic, and the
                            police resources and he did not see how they could be pried loose from
                            these.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Fulbright</persName> said that he had been enormously
                            impressed by the implication of recent Soviet accomplishments and
                            attached much greater significance to them than did the Secretary. He
                            said he thought he was more “scared” of the present hot war potential of
                            the Soviet Union than the Secretary was.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Fulbright</persName> asked the Secretary what the
                            effect of the Sputnik was abroad. The Secretary said the Sputnik had
                            less effect abroad than it had in the United States. The Senator asked
                            about its effect in the neutral areas. The Secretary replied that he had
                            not seen recent reports but it was his impression that in some ways it
                            helped the neutral areas in that the Soviets were considered the chief
                            war makers in the world rather than the United States. The Secretary
                            asked Mr. <persName>Macomber</persName> whether he had seen any reports
                            regarding the Sputnik abroad. The latter said it was his impression that
                            the preliminary reports indicated a growing hesitancy on the part of the
                            neutral areas who had tended to lean toward the West to commit
                            themselves in our direction. They seemed more anxious than before to
                            wait a little longer to see whether the West or the Soviet Union would
                            come out on top. On the other hand, Sputnik had tended to draw the
                            Western European nations closer together and to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to his earlier theme, the Secretary stressed the importance of
                            having a policy which envisioned a successful conclusion to our efforts.
                            He said that the only logical and sound policy, if we accepted the
                            Senator’s reasoning, would be preventive war. The Senator’s comment on
                            this point was that regardless of logic a country like the United States
                            with democratic institutions was incapable of initiating a preventive
                            war.</p>

                                        >NATO</gloss> statement that the West would not use force
                                    unless attacked and, ostensibly in consideration of this
                                    statement, the Supreme Soviet instructed the Soviet Government
                                    to consider further unilateral reductions in Soviet military
                                    forces. Since 1955, the USSR has announced two major unilateral
                                    troop reductions totaling 1,840,000 men. These reductions appear
                                    to have been carried out to a substantial degree, although full
                                    confirmation is lacking. No reductions are thought to have
                                    occurred in 1957. Announcement of a new cut in response to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> conference had been

                                    Communist movement in the face of “reactionary” efforts to split
                                    it. He regretted Yugoslavia’s failure to sign the 12-Party
                                    declaration as showing that ideological and political
                                    differences continued to exist. On the other hand, he stressed
                                    the “joint front” existing on many important issues and promised

                                    status quo, to set up an “atom-free” zone, and to sign a
                                    non-aggression agreement between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>In general, the statements struck a note similar to that in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName>’s letters. They indicated no
                            particular haste to enter negotiations, but rather reflected a belief
                            that at the present juncture, the USSR can afford to hold out for talks
                            more nearly on its own terms, (especially with respect to participants),
                            than on previous occasions. Moscow seems intent on fostering
                            inclinations in the West toward negotiation and toward going slow on new
                            military decisions by striking a favorable attitude toward Norway and
                            Denmark as well as Canada, by such unilateral concessions as the
                            announcement of another troop reduction, and by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s unusual inference that
                            Soviet military development will be limited so as not to curtail the
                            needs of other sectors of the economy. The statements make clear again
                            that if negotiations should eventuate, a priority Soviet goal will be to
                            obtain explicit Western recognition of the status quo in Eastern
                            Europe.</p>

                            <p>The general question of admitting to the United States various groups
                                of visitors from Russia, such as Russian farmers, athletes, etc., is
                                the subject of a paper recently considered by the National Security
                                Council. The President directed that the paper be referred to the
                                Secretary of State and the Attorney General for consultation and
                                decision. As a result of such consultation, it has been agreed that
                                as to all future applications for admission of visitors from Russia,
                                this plan will be followed:—</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State will informally advise the Attorney General or
                                the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service of
                                the group that desires to come to the United States. The Immigration
                                and Naturalization Service will then develop, in consultation with
                                the State Department, the necessary plans and controls which should
                                be put into effect, including the selection of a non-Governmental
                                organization to make arrangements for and to monitor the visitors
                                while in the United States in cases where such action is <pb n="194"
                                    xml:id="pg_194" facs="0224"/>appropriate. When such plans are
                                complete, the Secretary of State will be advised, at which time the
                                necessary formal actions will be taken to authorize admission.</p>

                            developments with respect to the subject, noting that at the Council
                            meeting of February 17, 1955, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            considered recommendations by the Planning Board to admit a limited
                            increase in the number of non-official temporary visitors otherwise
                            excludable under the McCarran Act for the purpose of countering foreign
                            talk that it is the United States, rather than the USSR, that is
                            maintaining an “iron curtain”. He noted that at its February 17 meeting
                            the Council was favorably disposed toward paragraphs 10 and 11 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508, but that it found the provisions
                            of paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of that report unacceptable. Accordingly,
                            the Council referred <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508 to the
                            Secretary of State and the Attorney General for further consideration in
                            the light of the Council discussion on February 17, and for subsequent

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> stated that on March 22

                            summarizing the considerations and action taken pursuant to the
                            Council’s discussion at its meeting of February 17. He mentioned that
                            the memoranda reflected that harmony had prevailed between the
                            Departments of State and Justice since this subject was last considered,
                            and commented that the Planning Board, by its consideration of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508, served in the capacity of midwife
                            to the Departments of State and Justice in helping to resolve the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> indicated that the March
                            22 memoranda before the Council for consideration today included a
                            paragraph, agreed to by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General,
                            to be substituted in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508 for
                            paragraphs 12, 13 and 14.</p>
                        <p>To refresh the Council’s recollection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> summarized paragraphs 10 and 11 of the “Policy
                            Guidance” statement contained in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5508. He then read the paragraph which the Departments of <pb n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0226"/>State and Justice recommended for
                            insertion in the “Policy Guidance” statement in lieu of paragraphs 12,
                            13 and 14.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> indicated that the
                            Departments of State and Justice had been proceeding along the lines
                            indicated in the proposed paragraph; that they had followed these
                            recommended procedures in the case of the proposed admission of the
                            Soviet student and youth newspaper editors, and in the case of the
                            Soviet “agriculturists” who had been recommended for admission to the
                            United States. He mentioned, with respect to the former group, that some
                            of the “youths” designated for admission were forty years of age or
                            more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> next directed attention
                            to the third paragraph of the Attorney General’s summary report dated
                            March 22, which indicated that as a result of consultation between the
                            Departments of State and Justice, it had been agreed that the plan
                            outlined in the substitute paragraph mentioned above would be followed
                            “as to all future applications for admission of visitors from Russia.”
                            He said that it was his understanding that the Policy Guidance contained
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508 was not intended to be
                            limited in its application to Russian nationals, but that it was also to
                            be applied to certain nationals of other European countries, both Soviet
                            bloc and non-Soviet bloc, who were excludable under applicable sections
                            of the McCarran Act. The Attorney General confirmed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>’s understanding that the
                            substitute paragraph was not intended to be limited to Russian
                            nationals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> suggested,
                            accordingly, that a phrase be included in the proposed substitute
                            paragraph to indicate that it applied to those categories of persons
                            falling within paragraphs 10 or 11 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5508. The Attorney General concurred in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>’s proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then raised a question
                            as to whether the word “religious” should be included in paragraphs 10–d
                            and 11–c of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508, in view of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ comments with
                            respect to this aspect of the subject at the February 17 meeting of the
                            Council. The Secretary of State indicated that he would like to see the
                            word “religious” added in both instances.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> raised a question
                            as to the application of the term “scientific” in paragraphs 10 and 11
                            of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5508, wherein those paragraphs
                            refer to the admission of otherwise excludable aliens for participation
                            in scientific, cultural, educational, or other types of meetings. He
                            thought that we should be sure how far we intended to go with respect to
                            the admission of such individuals for scientific purposes. He referred
                            to a recent instance in Japan where Soviet technologists were granted
                            entry and it later turned out that their real purpose in entering Japan
                            was to examine Japanese plants engaged in manufacturing munitions for
                            the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> thought it would be a good idea to insert the
                            word “religious” <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0227"/>in paragraphs
                            10 and 11, and to drop the word “scientific” from those paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired
                            whether the granting of admission permitted these aliens to go anywhere
                            they liked in the United States. The Attorney General responded in the
                            negative, stating that their travels were to be very carefully
                            supervised and controlled.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice was receiving
                            very “bitter” mail critical of the United States for permitting these
                            people to enter the country. In response to the President’s inquiry as
                            to the source of these criticisms, the Attorney General said the mail
                            emanated from patriotic organizations and individuals.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> if he was going to make a report on what those
                            people who had been permitted entry previous to this time actually said
                            and did when they returned to their home lands. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> replied in the affirmative, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> thereupon read the
                            highlights of a report<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> which he had received from the Director of
                            Central Intelligence, outlining highly critical and false propaganda
                            charges which some of these visitors had made. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> noted that among other things
                            some of the representatives from iron curtain countries who attended the
                            recent Evanston Assembly of the World Council of Churches made the
                            following accusations or complaints when they went back behind the iron
                            curtain: (a) They were put under surveillance by U.S. secret police; (b)
                            they—and even the Archbishop of Canterbury—were fingerprinted in the
                            same manner as Chicago gangsters; (ç) there was a crime wave in Chicago;
                            (d) Bishop Peter<note n="5" xml:id="d93fn5">Bishop Janos Peter of the
                                Reformed Church of Hungary.</note> referred to an Evanston memorial
                            to World War II dead which bears the inscription “December 7,
                            1941—blank”, and charged that the failure of local officials to insert
                            the second date was proof that the war had not ended so far as the
                            United States was concerned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> pointed out in this connection that in some
                            instances the governments of these people probably compelled them to
                            make such charges when they returned home.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the foregoing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> made a comment about the happiness expressed by
                            the Secretary of State at the February 17 meeting over the fact that
                            these religious people were permitted entry to this country. The
                            Secretary said that he wanted to correct any misunderstanding on that
                            score. He said he was happy that such a great organization as the World
                            Council of Churches wasn’t driven away, for he thought it would have
                            been scandalous if the World Council had been forced by our policies to
                            hold its meeting outside the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>The Attorney General indicated that the only reason these people were
                            being let in was to help the national interests of the United States. He
                            thought, accordingly, that the Director of Central Intelligence should
                            continue to keep a close check on what such people did and said when
                            they returned to their respective homelands, for the purpose of
                            determining whether we were achieving the desired results in granting
                            them entry to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> thought that the
                            Director of Central Intelligence should report on the general
                            psychological attitude being evinced around the world regarding the
                            restrictive policies of our immigration laws, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> replied that this subject was
                            already covered in the basic paper.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, speaking of
                            other psychological aspects of the cold war, mentioned that he had seen
                            an item on TV from New York last night describing the interview which
                            was held with one of the two Americans who had been thoroughly
                            brain-washed by the Chinese Communists and who had returned to the
                            United States by air yesterday. He thought the manner in which this
                            individual “carried on” before the press and cameras was shocking; that
                            he was vitriolic in his criticism of the United States to the point that
                            it would make one’s blood run cold to witness such a demonstration on
                            the part of any American.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that in the
                            case of the American prisoners of war who were captured by the Chinese
                            Communists and brainwashed, the military tried to take care of that
                            situation by keeping them in camps for a while after they were brought
                            back to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that while
                            he had not seen the TV broadcast referred to by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he had heard about it, and that
                            the general impression of those who reported it to him was along the
                            lines that a terrible thing had been done to the returnee by the Chinese
                            Communists in that he had obviously become deranged mentally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> thought that it
                            might be a good idea to put such individuals on slow boats rather than
                            fly them back to the United States immediately after their release by
                            the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that some of the newspaper people, by their
                            ballyhooing of a situation of this sort, were only trying to stir up
                            controversy, and he cited, as an example, the effort on the part of the
                            people at his press conference yesterday to try and point <pb n="199"
                                xml:id="pg_199" facs="0229"/>up differences between the Secretary of

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, referring to the
                            fact that Soviet “agriculturists” would be coming in in the near future,
                            said that it was in one respect a good thing, in that it indicated to
                            him, from a military point of view, that the food situation in the
                            Soviet Union was bad. On the other hand, he said he didn’t want to help
                            that particular situation by enabling their agricultural experts,
                            through visits to the United States, to learn ways and means of
                            bettering the agricultural situation in the Soviet Union. To this the
                            President said that he did not believe that permitting a few Soviet
                            farmers to visit this country would improve the situation one-half of
                            one per cent. The President pointed out that the Russians got all of our
                            literature and pamphlets on subjects. Furthermore, the President said,
                            when U.S. farmers visited the Soviet Union they would be in a position
                            to talk about how superior their agricultural attainments were to those
                            of the USSR. In addition, the President said that this program was
                            designed to help individuals as well as governments to get together.
                            Considering these and related psychological factors, the President said,
                            he did not feel too concerned about the point raised by Secretary

                                enhanced awareness of the Communist threat, has been reluctant to
                                admit European Soviet Bloc private citizens. As a result, the U.S.
                                is placed in a paradoxical position, which is being exploited by
                                Communist propaganda. Despite its traditional policy favoring
                                freedom of travel and its record of having favored a liberal
                                exchange of persons with the USSR in the post-war period, the U.S.
                                is being accused of maintaining an “Iron Curtain”; and these
                                accusations are being made not only by representatives of
                                international Communism but also by otherwise friendly persons in
                                the free world. This situation is causing damage, and may cause
                                further damage, to U.S. prestige and the U.S. reputation for liberal
                                world leadership.</item>

                                who are communists and subversives are excludable from admission to
                                the U.S. Such of these aliens who there is reason to believe would

                                admissible under no circumstances. The Act does permit the Attorney

                                exercise discretion to admit temporarily communists and other
                                potential subversives not included in the above categories. Under
                                the present statute, the Attorney General has exercised his
                                discretion in favor of admitting 33 Soviet Union private citizens
                                during 1953 and 1954.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">In addition, the

                                        all but about 30% of the Soviet land area. Americans and
                                        other foreigners may visit over 70% of large Soviet cities

                                        Occasionally, American or other foreign visitors are

                                        70% of large American cities and may transit closed areas by

                                broadening the exchange of visitors between the Soviet Bloc and the
                                United States to proportions greater than the limited program
                                contemplated in this paper. While it appears that a considerable
                                intelligence advantage would be gained by large-scale visits of U.S.
                                citizens to the Soviet Bloc nations, and while a broader program
                                would give this nation more freedom in seizing the initiative in the
                                propaganda warfare over the “Iron Curtain” allegedly erected by the
                                United States, it does not appear that such a program is feasible
                                within the framework of present law or national security policies.
                                It must be recognized that waiver of inadmissibility is an exception
                                and that the policy written into the terms of the Immigration and
                                Nationality Act itself is a policy of exclusion. Exercise of the
                                Attorney General’s discretion to waive inadmissibility in any great
                                number of cases would convert the exception into a rule, and a legal
                                basis for any such program would probably require an amendment of
                                the existing provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It
                                must further be recognized that the admission of any great number of
                                Soviet Bloc nationals would increase the internal security problems
                                attendant upon any such program, with a consequent increase in the
                                administrative burden imposed on the responsible agencies.</item>

                                exclusion provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act
                                applicable to Soviet Bloc nationals apply equally to Communists,
                                Communist sympathizers and other potential subversives from
                                non-Soviet Bloc countries. A policy which admits excludable Soviet
                                Bloc nationals and at the same time denies admission to excludable
                                non-Bloc visa applicants is open to a challenge of inconsistency.
                                Such persons, of course, are more apt to be Communists by conviction
                                than many visitors from the Bloc countries. They are more likely to
                                be effective propagandists. Their admission leads to no reciprocal
                                travel advantages. They are not subject to travel restrictions
                                applicable to USSR citizens. On the other hand, exclusion of such
                                persons may be detrimental to the U.S. reputation among foreign free
                                world nations. Their admission might permit the <pb n="205"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> advised the Council that
                            during the last several weeks there had been a “rash” of press stories
                            and letters to editors, alleging that the Post Office Department was
                            obstructing the receipt of copies of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> sent through the mails to recipients
                            in the United States. Based on these allegations the Planning Board,
                            supplemented by representatives of the Departments of Justice, the <pb
                                n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0239"/>Post Office, and Commerce, and
                            by the <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House Press
                            Secretary, prepared the reference report of March 29 which was scheduled
                            on today’s Council agenda. He said that the report focused upon only one
                            particular aspect of the much broader subject of “Importation of
                            Communist Propaganda”. He noted that at its May 13, 1954, meeting<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d96fn5">A memorandum of the discussion at this meeting
                                is in Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> Records.</note> the Council considered that broader
                            subject and agreed that in lieu of seeking legislation with respect
                            thereto, the responsible agencies should remain alert to the problem and
                            do everything possible within the means now available to defeat
                            Communist objectives in importing propaganda.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then summarized the
                            March 29 report of the Planning Board, which dealt with the more limited
                            subject of “Importation of Communist Periodicals”. He then read to the
                            Council paragraph 4 of the report, which paragraph was submitted for
                            action by the Planning Board.</p>
                        <p>The Postmaster General<note n="6" xml:id="d96fn6">Arthur E.
                                Summerfield.</note> said his Department would have no objection to
                            paragraph 4; that it could see no great danger in releasing the 450
                            copies of <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and the 450 copies of <hi
                                rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> which were currently being withheld from
                            the mails. He said, however, that in the case of certain other foreign
                            Communist publications, the Post Office Department had some question as
                            to whether they should be permitted to pass through our postal system,
                            inasmuch as they contained political propaganda. He added that he did
                            not think this question was a major one, and expressed the view that if
                            problems did arise with respect to other publications, the Post Office
                            Department would get together with the agencies concerned, as outlined
                            in paragraph 4–b of the reference memorandum on the subject. He said
                            that his Department would prefer to see the language in paragraph 4
                            qualified by including a provision that only a limited number of such
                            periodicals would be permitted to pass through our postal system to
                            their ultimate addressees. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> pointed out that if the numbers of such
                            periodicals increased greatly, and if they were construed to contain
                            propaganda, they would be kept out under paragraph 4 as presently
                            written. The Postmaster General responded that there would be no
                            necessity for amending the paragraph along the lines suggested by him so
                            long as the interpretation expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> was understood by all parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the Council discussion on this subject with the
                            statement that he was astonished that the Post Office Department
                            couldn’t lose these things and not say anything about it.</p>

                                    We talked about a freer flow of news across the Curtains of all
                                    kinds. We talked about the circulation of books, and
                                    particularly we talked about peaceful trade. But the subject
                                    that took most of our attention in this regard was the
                                    possibility of increased visits by the citizens of one country
                                    into the territory of another, doing this in such a way as to
                                    give each the fullest possible opportunity to learn about the
                                    people of the other nation. In this particular subject there was
                                    the greatest possible degree of agreement. As a matter of fact,
                                    it was agreement often repeated and enthusiastically supported
                                    by the words of the members of each side.</p>
                                <p>“As a matter of fact, each side assured the other earnestly and
                                    often that it intended to pursue a new spirit of conciliation
                                    and cooperation in its contacts with the other. Now, of course,
                                    we are profoundly hopeful that these assurances will be
                                    faithfully carried out.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> August

                                <persName>Jackson</persName> for agreeing to accept the difficult
                            job of coordinating the United States position on East-West contacts for
                            the Geneva Conference,<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">For text of the
                                Department of State press release of September 19 announcing

                                appointment, effective that date, as Special Assistant to the
                                Secretary of State “to coordinate within the U.S. Government the
                                development of U.S. positions for phases of the Foreign Ministers
                                meeting at Geneva pertaining to East-West contacts and exchanges,”
                                see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 3,
                                1955, p. 529.</note> the <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0242"
                            />Secretary said that he felt this whole subject was an extremely
                            complicated one. He had the feeling that everyone wants to penetrate the
                            Soviet Union, but no one wants the Soviet Union to penetrate us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we should keep very much in mind problems of
                            reciprocity in connection with East-West contacts. For example, he noted
                            that one of the proposals which had been advanced was to establish a
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> center in Moscow. This might
                            be a fine idea in itself, but it would obviously cause the Soviets to
                            request the establishment of a Soviet information center in the United
                            States. The Secretary anticipated that we would have a very hard time
                            with Congressional representatives and a large segment of the American
                            people if we consented to the establishment of a Soviet propaganda mill
                            in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Secretary observed that we are currently doing certain
                            things with regard to the Soviets which might be difficult to alter. The
                            Post Office stops Soviet publications from coming in and has warehouses
                            full of such material. To reverse this practice might be difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SW1">Stoessel</persName> mentioned, with regard
                            to controls over Communist literature, that there are two bookstores in
                            New York which act as agents for Soviet publications. These bookstores
                            receive Soviet publications without hindrance and have available for
                            distribution in this country some 500 Soviet newspapers and periodicals.
                            The Secretary said he was interested to hear this and that it should be
                            taken into account in our work on East-West contacts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that some people talk about “eliminating the Soviet
                            iron curtain” in a physical sense, i.e., to remove the actual barriers
                            of barbed wire, watch towers, and so on. Again, this idea sounds
                            appealing but might cause us some trouble. The Secretary recalled that
                            he had talked recently with General Swing, of the Immigration and
                            Naturalization Service, who had described in some detail our system of
                            barbed wire barriers along the United States-Mexican border.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d98fn3">No record of this conversation has been
                                found.</note> In addition to these barriers, it appears that U.S.
                            patrols send out bloodhounds to track down persons attempting to cross
                            this border. The Secretary understood the Communists have made a movie
                            about these American border controls and that we might have this
                            situation thrown back at us if we raise a question about removal of
                            Soviet border patrols.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary believed that we should concentrate on items in East-West
                            contacts on which we are in a position to reciprocate. He <pb n="213"
                                xml:id="pg_213" facs="0243"/>thought that radio communications and
                            circulation of newspapers fitted into this category. We do not jam
                            Soviet radio broadcasts to this country and we give full publicity in
                            our newspapers to all speeches made by Soviet leaders. It might be
                            possible to accomplish something in this field, so that the peoples of
                            both countries will know what the leaders of both countries are saying.
                            In the present situation, there is a blackout in the Soviet Union of
                            true news about the United States. The Soviet communications media
                            distort the American position on major issues and the Soviet people have
                            little choice but to believe these distortions. This is a dangerous
                            situation which we should try to improve.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recognized that there would be difficulties in discussing
                            this subject with the Soviets. For one thing, the Soviets have a
                            controlled press and we have an uncontrolled press. No doubt, our press
                            prints many things about the Soviet Union which are distortions of the
                            truth and which are unpalatable to the Soviet leaders. The Soviets could
                            point to this fact and ask us to take steps to correct this situation in
                            the U.S. This would have to be rejected of course, since the press in
                            the U.S. is free to print what it wishes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that one of the chief difficulties we are faced with
                            is that information the Soviets wish to disseminate in this country is
                            known to all in the United States. On the other hand, what we try to get
                            across to the Soviet Union is known to very few people there. Even
                            though we may <hi rend="italic">think</hi> that we are reaching a
                            considerable number of people in the Soviet Union through radio or other
                            means, there is no way of proving this. The Secretary recalled that when
                            he was in Moscow in 1947<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4"
                                    ><persName>Dulles</persName> was a member of the U.S. Delegation
                                to the Fourth Session of the Council of Ministers held at Moscow,
                                March 10–April 24, 1947.</note> he had been told that copies of the
                            Russian language magazine <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> were very rare
                            and were sold at bootleg prices. This was because, the Secretary
                            understood, the Soviet Government was buying up all copies of <hi
                                rend="italic">Amerika</hi> and very few copies were actually getting
                            out to the people. This simply pointed up to him the task we have in
                            insuring dissemination of our ideas in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of fingerprinting, the Secretary remarked that this was a
                            question for action by Congress and that obviously we could not make any
                            commitments one way or the other on it at Geneva. He thought we should
                            look into the matter carefully and weigh the pros and cons of asking
                            Congress to rescind the fingerprinting provision. For himself, he was
                            not very sympathetic to changing the law. Many people here had objected
                            to fingerprinting when it was first introduced but now they had grown
                            used to it.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>In answer to Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName>’s question as to how the
                            East-West contacts item had come up in discussions between the four
                            powers, the Secretary said that at the opening session of the Heads of
                            Government Conference in Geneva, each speaker had referred to the
                            desirability of increased contacts and this subject was subsequently
                            placed on the agenda for discussion. As it turned out, only President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Faure</persName> had made statements on East-West
                            contacts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> had submitted
                            statements which had not been read at the meeting. The Secretary’s
                            impression was that the Soviets had emphasized trade and tourism in
                            their opening remarks on the subject,<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">See
                                    <ref target="#d97"><hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></ref></note>
                            but that there had been no discussion which went very deep into the
                            whole question of East-West contacts.</p>
                        <p>With regard to handling of the East-West contacts item at the October
                            meeting in Geneva, the Secretary thought that it would be best to have a
                            sub-committee of experts designated to go to work on this item at the
                            start of the meeting. They could prepare positions on this subject which
                            could then be considered by the Foreign Ministers. The Secretary thought
                            he might suggest this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> when he saw him in New York.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d98fn6"><persName>Dulles</persName> met with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, Foreign Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, and Foreign
                                Minister Pinay in New York on September 27.</note> He believed that
                            the directive of the Heads of State meeting provided for such a method
                            of handling the question at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>In preparing our position, the Secretary felt it was important to
                            coordinate with the British and French and not let them feel that they
                            were being left out of any arrangements between the U.S. and the Soviet
                            Union. He recognized, however, that many of the specific projects which
                            the U.S. wished to propose would be of a bilateral nature with the
                            Soviet Union. The Secretary indicated agreement with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>’s suggestion that the
                            East-West contacts item be handled in a very general way with the
                            Tripartite working group now meeting in Washington and that detailed
                            discussion of it should be postponed until the working group meets in
                            Paris immediately before the October conference.</p>

                            United Kingdom thinking (as expressed by Paul Grey, Assistant
                            Undersecretary in the Foreign Office and the British expert at Geneva on
                            East-West contacts) with regard to follow-up action on East-West
                            contacts during the post-Geneva period. The U.K. presently feels it
                            would be well to let any follow-up “lie fallow” for a time in order to
                            see what the Soviets may do during this pause. Mr.
                                <persName>Grey</persName> thought, however, that the U.S. might wish
                            to take bilateral action on specific items of interest to it. He asked
                            for our thinking concerning East-West contacts.</p>

                            London’s cable and states that we feel it would be advisable for the
                            U.S. to initiate action with the Soviets on a bilateral basis regarding
                            certain points included in the 17-point Western memorandum on East-West
                            contacts submitted at Geneva on October 31 (Tab C<note n="4"

                                778–779.</note>). This would demonstrate that we were sincere in
                            espousing these proposals and were not merely seeking propaganda effect.
                            Our telegram would also go to Paris so that the views expressed therein
                            could be discussed with the French.</p>
                        <p>Most of the points on which we recommend action would seem to be
                            non-controversial and of advantage to the U.S. (book and publications
                            exchanges, films, exhibits, reciprocal reduction in travel
                            restrictions). A decision to move ahead on these is required, however.
                            Certain policy questions arise in connection with exchanges of expert
                            groups which should be decided before we proceed with the course of
                            action outlined in the attached cable. These questions <pb n="216"
                                xml:id="pg_216" facs="0246"/>involve propaganda, intelligence and
                            public relations issues. These issues must be dealt with whether we like
                            it or not. They are being dealt with now on a piece-meal, ad hoc basis
                            with all of the attendant risks of such an approach. This is not a
                            satisfactory way to develop national policy.</p>
                        <p>As stated therein, we have already approached the Soviet Foreign Office
                            with a suggestion that talks be instituted in Washington between
                            representatives of the Department and of the Soviet Embassy to make
                            plans for exchanges for a one-year period in various fields—for example,
                            in agriculture and medicine. (Tab D reports Embassy Moscow’s approach on
                            this subject.)<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">Telegram 1115 from Moscow,
                                November 12, was not found attached. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 032/11–1255)</note> No answer has been received from the
                            Soviets to this approach, and it may be that, as it appeared at Geneva,
                            they will attempt to evade commitments for the careful planning of
                            exchanges in advance on a basis of mutual advantage, but will try to
                            conduct exchanges in the future on the present ad hoc basis.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted that the Soviets have already accepted our proposal on
                                <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi> magazine and have taken the
                            initiative recently in proposing student and professor exchanges,
                            despite the lack of a positive Soviet stand on these points at Geneva.
                            They have also made several new proposals for technical exchanges.</p>
                        <p>We believe exchanges will continue between the U.S. and the USSR. The
                            latter wants to obtain technical know-how and propaganda benefits from
                            exchanges. Many individuals in the United States are anxious to promote
                            or take part in exchanges with the USSR. The latter group includes those
                            who look hopefully at any sign of “peace”, those who believe in a sort
                            of non-political “people’s diplomacy”, those who feel we will undermine
                            the regime by exposing the people to Free World influences, and those,
                            such as many scientists, who feel it essential that we have “contacts”
                            in order to get to other specialists and show them the Free World is
                            both unafraid and positively interested in mutual sharing of
                            information. There are also those Americans interested in business
                            dealings—both legitimate commercial enterprises and the promoter type.
                            It would not appear advisable for us to attempt to bar further
                            exchanges, since this would be incompatible with our stand favoring
                            increased East-West contacts and would cut us off from obtaining
                            intelligence benefits ourselves from exchanges. Also, we think more
                            contact with the West will give Soviet officials a better understanding
                            of Western realities and may help promote evolutionary trends in the
                            USSR in the long run.</p>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>If exchanges are to continue, and they will whether we like it or not
                            since passport controls are off and the Soviets are interested in
                            sponsoring visits, it is important that we take the initiative in
                            suggesting exchanges we want to see carried out, and in preparing
                            careful plans for such projects. Therefore, we would propose to press
                            the Soviets to accept our ideas on exchanges in the fields of
                            agriculture and medicine, even if they do not seem inclined to respond
                            to our initial approach. Moreover, we would wish to propose during the
                            coming year a few additional exchanges in areas of high intelligence
                            priority (for example, petroleum, transport, plastics). Groups would be
                            small in size and publicity would be held to a minimum. The
                            fingerprinting problem would not be a difficulty in such exchange, since
                            incoming Soviet groups would be professional and capable of
                            classification as official.</p>
                        <p>Action of this kind presupposes policy agreement on the following points: <list>

                        <p>The attitude of Harvard University is as follows. In the first place, it
                            wishes to be guided by the policy of the United States in making any
                            reply to the above mentioned proposal. Second, if the policy would
                            permit acceptance, an acceptance which Harvard would be glad to explore,
                            Harvard would agree to the exchange only if bona fide scholars were
                            involved, but would limit its exchange to Harvard personnel of
                            professorial or post-graduate grade (not undergraduate students).</p>

                                Anderson</persName>, it seems to me that the issue raised is covered

                            easily bring the policy paper to your attention. The question at issue
                            is whether the Department of State is willing to move under that policy,
                            getting the necessary clearance from the Attorney General.</p>

                        <p>I have ventured to write you this personal memorandum because I find that
                            my opinion, which is favorable to accept this proposal, is shared by

                            think in view of what I have written above that it is necessary to
                            bother him. I feel sure that he would agree with the point of view which
                            is just expressed.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion the U.S. has much more to gain from such an exchange than
                            the USSR. Of course proper safeguards would necessarily be taken in
                            accordance with usual practice. Therefore, I hope that you will find a
                            moment to consider and give some determinative action on this

                        <p>The reason for taking such determinative action is that Harvard should

                                    exchanges were essentially a foreign policy program, “it is my
                                    belief that primary responsibility for it should be within the
                                    Department of State although it is obviously desirable that the
                                    views of other departments should be obtained.”
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName>’ memorandum and the attached

                                <p>This paper superseded a previous Department of State paper on the

                                    submitted to <persName>Dulles</persName> on April 10. The June 6
                                    paper was an outgrowth of, and closely resembled, a draft paper
                                    prepared by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> on May 12, which he prefaced with the
                                    remark that he had read the previous papers on the subject and
                                    had gained the impression that “we are thinking too much in
                                    terms of detail and not enough in terms of broad policy and
                                    scope for the execution of that policy.” When the June 6 paper

                                “Titoism” is now regarded as respectable by the Soviet rulers, and
                                that it is profitable to Tito, encourages those within the satellite
                                countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary to seek a

                                exchanges along the indicated lines on the basis of bilateral

                                <item>One aspect of this matter which requires particular
                                    consideration is the impact of what we do upon third countries.
                                    In many cases, the United States can tolerate a type of exchange
                                    which to other countries would be poisonous. It is suggested
                                    that consideration should be given to explaining to third
                                    countries, on a confidential basis, the scope and purpose of our
                                    program and the precautions we would take, so that they will not
                                    misconstrue what we do as evidence that we believe that Soviet
                                    purposes have now become benign. This could be done, for
                                    example, as regards the American Republics at a meeting of the
                                    Ambassadors, such as we have had with increasing frequency in
                                    recent months. There could be similar expositions made on a
                                    selective basis with friendly countries of Africa and Asia. In
                                    this way, it could be made clear that what we do is a part of
                                        <hi rend="italic">our</hi> policy designed to weaken
                                    International Communism, and that it is not either an
                                    acquiescence in Soviet policy or a recognition that Soviet
                                    motives have so changed that they are no longer to be
                                    feared.</item>

                                                particular consideration is the impact of what we do
                                                upon third countries as well as upon military,
                                                political and economic cooperation among the
                                                countries of the free world. In many cases, the
                                                United States can tolerate a type of exchange which
                                                to other countries would be poisonous. Also, it is
                                                recognized that our embarking upon this policy may
                                                have a serious impact upon our capacity to maintain

                                                much as possible, we must exert constant and
                                                strenuous effort to convince third countries that
                                                our program is not to be construed as evidence that

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> briefed the National Security Council
                            on the contents of the draft statement of policy on the subject, and
                            pointed out that, in addition to the usual membership, the Secretary of
                            Commerce and Messrs. <persName>J. Edgar Hoover</persName> and
                                <persName>J. Walter Yeagley</persName>, Chairman of the Council’s
                            internal security committees, had been invited to attend this Council
                            meeting. (Copy of Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>’s brief filed in the
                            minutes of the meeting.) At the conclusion of his briefing, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that the Secretary of State
                            explain the philosophy behind the policy report.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this
                            paper, as Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had pointed out, had come to
                            the National Security Council by a somewhat unusual route. He himself
                            had personally drafted the statement of policy, for the reason that the
                            situation with regard to East-West exchanges had seemed to be hopelessly
                            bogged down. <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>The President had
                            grown impatient, and had asked the Secretary of State to draft a new
                            policy position on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The basic theory behind the new policy statement was that as this
                            Government had hitherto been proceeding in the area of East-West
                            exchanges its attitude had proved too passive and inert. All initiative
                            in developing East-West contacts had been left either in the hands of
                            the Soviets or in the hands of private American groups. This situation
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed to be
                            wrong, and he took the position that the U.S. Government should be
                            thinking about what it wanted to do as a government, and not simply
                            continue to act as a screen for private U.S. or Soviet proposals for
                            increased East-West contacts. The President had evinced a very great
                            interest in this matter at the Summit Conference at Geneva, and had
                            maintained his interest ever since that time. Indeed, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName> had made a most
                            thorough study of the problem of East-West contacts prior to the Summit
                            meeting, and Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> was of course present at
                            the meeting today. As a result of Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName>’s
                            studies, a program for U.S. initiatives in the area of East-West
                            contacts had been presented to the Soviets at the Geneva Foreign
                            Ministers meeting. The Soviets, however, had turned down the U.S.
                            program because, they said, it promoted the kind of exchanges which
                            would be valuable to the United States but not the kind of exchanges
                            desired by the Soviet Union. While this had been the Soviet attitude at
                            Geneva, there were now indications that their views were changing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                            that the 17-point program elaborated by Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName>
                            was a very good illustration of the kind of exchanges which the United
                            States felt would be advantageous. As for the Soviet view of East-West
                            exchanges, they had two main objectives in mind—first, through these
                            exchanges to gain technical information which would prove of value, and
                            secondly, to set precedents with respect to exchanges which they could
                            make valid for third countries and thus gain political advantages which
                            they could not hope to gain from exchanges with the United States. There
                            were many types of exchanges which might prove advantageous or tolerable
                            to the United States which would be bad for third countries not
                            sufficiently strong or sufficiently shrewd to resist Soviet
                            machinations. In concluding his statement on the general philosophy of
                            the new policy statement, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that it reflected his belief that the United
                            States could and should assume the offensive in the area of East-West
                            exchanges. If we did this we could present the Soviet Union with hard
                            choices and sharp dilemmas that the Soviets will not like, rather than,
                            as in the past, permitting the Soviets to confront the United States
                            with such choices and dilemmas. While the United States would never take
                            the <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"/>military offensive against
                            the USSR, it should certainly be prepared to take the offensive in the
                            area of East-West contacts.</p>
                        <p>As to the dangers to third countries of the U.S. example of encouraging
                            exchanges with the Soviet Union, alluded to by Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> and noted in the present policy paper,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed that the
                            United States would have to proceed here with very great care. As a
                            basic precaution against a misunderstanding of U.S. motives and
                            objectives in encouraging East-West contacts, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had suggested
                            confidential explanations by the U.S. Government to other governments
                            which might be pressured by the Soviets for exchanges which would not be
                            to their advantage. For example, in explaining our policy to the other
                            American Republics, we could quite easily make use of the vehicle of the
                            Organization of American States (OAS). Conversations in this body would
                            certainly minimize the risks of the weaker American Republics inviting
                            exchanges with the Soviet Union and citing the example of the United
                            States as a guide. With the countries of Asia and Africa, which might
                            well prove to be the target of Soviet initiatives, we could explain our
                            policy on exchanges with the Russians by means of bilateral
                            conversations. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            admitted, however, that private conversations, whether bilateral or
                            otherwise, would probably not wholly eliminate the risks that third
                            countries might misunderstand our policy and as a result themselves
                            become involved in unfortunate exchanges with the USSR. This was a risk
                            which we should have to run. The theoretical test of the proposed
                            exchanges between the U.S. and the USSR was whether or not, on balance,
                            they proved advantageous to the United States. They might well do so by
                            at long last providing the people of the Soviet Union with accurate
                            knowledge of the kind of opportunities that existed in the United States
                            for the ordinary run of citizens. Such knowledge might well stimulate
                            pressures on the Soviet Government to confer on its people rights and
                            advantages similar to those enjoyed by U.S. citizens. Such pressures
                            generated in the Soviet Union would certainly begin to absorb the
                            thoughts, plans and resources of the Soviet Government and, accordingly,
                            minimize the amount of energy and resources which the Soviet Government
                            could devote to its attack against the free world on other fronts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that
                            no policy directive in and by itself would provide a certain answer as
                            to the advantages and disadvantages of each exchange proposal. Each such
                            proposal should be weighed on its own merits, though, of course, we
                            might be obliged to accept a specific disadvantage and pay a specific
                            price in certain instances in order to secure an over-all net advantage
                            for the United States in the exchange program. Success or failure of the
                            program would depend on operations carried out under this new <pb
                                n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>policy paper. After all, no
                            policy can do more than indicate broad general principles, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that the
                            present report goes about as far as one could usefully go in setting
                            forth the criteria to govern East-West exchanges. Accordingly, it was
                            now time to “get going” on the new program. The United States was
                            already far behind the rest of the procession. Adoption of the new
                            policy paper would get us into the way of dealing with this problem more
                            intelligently and more expeditiously. If the policy did not work, it
                            could be changed in due course. Case law may in time modify statute law,
                            as it were.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ statement, Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            pointed out that the Council had not received the formal written views
                            of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the proposed new policy, and asked
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> if he would give
                            orally the views of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then handed Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> a copy of the written views of the

                            Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs recommended that the Department of Defense
                            be represented along with the Departments of State and Justice in
                            responsibility for coordinating the implementation of the policy. Apart
                            from these matters, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> indicated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were
                            very worried indeed about the impact of this new policy on our alliances
                            unless we made crystal-clear to our allies the objectives that we sought
                            in taking this new initiative toward expanding East-West contacts.
                            Explanation by the U.S. Government to other friendly governments was not
                            in itself enough, because these other governments would have to explain
                            to their people why it was perfectly safe for the United States to
                            indulge in contacts with the Soviet Union, whereas it might be dangerous
                            for the country in question to follow the U.S. example. Accordingly,
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> believed that
                            the Council should give careful consideration as to how far we could go
                            in coming out with a public explanation of the basis for this new U.S.
                            policy. If the 17-point program drawn up by Mr.
                                <persName>Jackson</persName> and set forth in the present paper as a
                            guide was to be <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0260"/>applied as a
                            package, that was one thing. If the 17-point program was to be applied
                            separately, it was quite another thing. The Council should remember that
                            the groups sent to the United States by the Soviet Union would all be
                            hand-picked. The cards would be stacked against the United States
                            because individual U.S. citizens would be free to visit the Soviet
                            Union, although when they got there they would see only what the Soviet
                            Union wanted them to see. Lastly, the U.S. Communist Party could be
                            expected to encourage all kinds of American leftists to visit the Soviet
                            Union. These people would come back, as had the scientific group lately,
                            with reports all highly favorable to the Soviet Union. In conclusion,
                            said Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, the Joint
                            Chiefs are prepared to admit the validity of the new policy proposed by
                            the Secretary of State, but they were very worried as to the safeguards
                            with which it would be carried out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then called on Secretary of Commerce
                            Weeks for his views on the policy. Secretary Weeks said he would address
                            himself solely to those exchanges of personnel in which the Department
                            of Commerce had a special interest. Thus, said Secretary Weeks, in
                            exchanges of businessmen and industrialists the Department of Commerce
                            was of the opinion that it should be given a formal role to play in the
                            carrying out of the new policy. For example, the Department of Commerce
                            should be consulted in advance as to the makeup of the teams of U.S.
                            industrialists who were going to be sent on exchanges to the Soviet
                            Union. The Department of Commerce was in a position to give good advice
                            as to the membership of such teams, as well as advice as to what they
                            should look for in the Soviet Union and what, in exchange, the Russians
                            should see in the United States. Up to now, at any rate, the Department
                            of Commerce had had no say in any of these matters.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Weeks then went on to comment on the impact of the export
                            control legislation. The export control legislation circumscribed
                            closely what it was legal for us to allow visiting Russians to see. For
                            example, since our export control legislation forbade us to export radio
                            tubes to the Soviet Union, it was obvious that it was contrary to the
                            spirit of the legislation to permit visiting Russians to see radio tubes
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Secretary Weeks said he had a couple of specific
                            recommendations to make in behalf of the Department of Commerce. First,
                            if Russian teams were going to come to the United States, the United
                            States should get a quid pro quo out of the visit. Admittedly the
                            over-all policy on East-West exchanges was a responsibility of the
                            Department of State, which developed our foreign policy. On the other
                            hand, the substantive content of the exchanges was not in itself a
                            foreign policy matter, and therefore Secretary Weeks hoped that whatever
                            department was best able to give good <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231"
                                facs="0261"/>advice should have an opportunity to provide such
                            advice. Certainly the Department of Commerce should be tied in more
                            closely in all matters relating to what the Soviets were doing in the
                            industrial field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that the coordination of
                            the implementation of U.S. policy with respect to East-West exchanges
                            had in the past been confined to the Departments of State and Justice.
                            Currently, however, and with respect to the new policy, the Planning
                            Board was recommending to the Council not only that the Departments of
                            State and Justice continue to be responsible for implementation, but had
                            also added other departments, agencies and boards, as appropriate.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he
                            entirely concurred in the views just expressed by the Secretary of
                            Commerce, and he believed that the Department of Commerce should be
                            brought right in on the ground floor with respect to any exchanges of
                            industrialists or other exchanges in which the views of the Commerce
                            Department would be useful. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> went on to
                            say that if the Council so desired, the Planning Board language could be
                            amended to add specifically the Departments of Defense and Commerce to
                            the implementing machinery if the more general language suggested by the
                            Planning Board—namely, “other departments, agencies and boards, as
                            appropriate”—was not deemed sufficient to cover the matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was
                            inclined to doubt the wisdom of specifying any other department than the
                            Department of Justice (and State) as constituting the coordinating
                            group. After all, the Department of Justice, for obvious reasons, would
                            be involved in each and every exchange between the U.S. and the USSR.
                            Other departments and agencies of the Government would be brought in
                            only when a given exchange proposal involved the specific
                            responsibilities of that department or agency. The implementation of the
                            proposed new policy would continue to be bogged down if the Council
                            insisted on putting in as coordinating authorities every department of
                            the Government which might conceivably have any interest in the
                            exchange. Accordingly, the Secretary of State thought that the general
                            language on implementation proposed by the Planning Board was quite
                            acceptable. Proposals for adding other departments by name would
                            probably have the result of stalling any offensive on the part of the
                            United States to increase East-West exchanges. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> insisted that he did not look on
                            the proposed new policy as forming the basis for a stalling operation
                            but, rather, to permit us to assume the initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary of Defense asked permission to state his general
                            philosophy with respect to the proposed new policy. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> then said that the
                            recommendations of the Joint <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"
                            />Chiefs of Staff, as earlier reported by Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, had the hearty endorsement
                            not only of the Service Secretaries, but of the Department of Defense as
                            a whole, particularly with respect to the need to stress the effect on
                            weaker third countries of initiative by the United States in the
                            direction of increased East-West contacts. While he stated himself to be
                            strongly in favor of taking the offensive in the field of East-West
                            contacts, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            said he was very worried about the possible effects of the proposed new
                            policy on such alliances as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Accordingly, he strongly
                            recommended that the Council agree to accept the substitute paragraph 10
                            proposed by the Department of Defense.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">See
                                subparagraph 3–c, <ref target="#d102">Document 102</ref>.</note>
                            This Defense version of paragraph 10 simply made explicit and firm the
                            possible danger to our military alliances and to the political and
                            economic cooperation in the free world of the adoption of an increased
                            program of East-West contacts by the United States. Moreover, while the
                            Department of Defense did not wish to have a hand in setting up all the
                            different exchanges which might be contemplated between the U.S. and the
                            USSR, it did wish to have its voice heard in any exchange which involved
                            the responsibilities of the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Speaking sharply, the Secretary of State informed Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> that the Department of State
                            was, after all, charged with the responsibility for conducting the
                            relations of the United States with its allies—<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, and all the
                            others. Quite possibly the State Department conducted these relations
                            badly, but it was nevertheless the fixed duty and responsibility of the
                            State Department. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> assumed that the Department of Defense did not
                            aspire to take over these duties of the Department of State. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            Defense Department certainly did not wish to take over any of the
                            responsibilities of the State Department. Nevertheless the Defense
                            Department had a very real interest, for example, in the relations
                            between the United States and those foreign countries in which the
                            United States had military bases.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he thought the language which directed
                            implementation of the policy was suitable and OK, and that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, having heard the
                            discussion at the present meeting, would certainly bear the different
                            points of view in mind and would be certain to bring in the Department
                            of Defense and the Department of Commerce when such a course of action
                            was clearly indicated with reference to a specific exchange proposal. On
                            the other hand, if, instead of the Departments of State and Justice, a
                                <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0263"/>whole large board of
                            officials was assigned the task of implementing the new policy, very
                            little would ever get done under it.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> suggested certain
                            new language which would indicate that the Department of Defense should
                            be kept informed of all impending exchange proposals in order that the
                            Department of Defense could be in a position to state its interest and
                            concern over any given proposal. If it were not kept informed of all
                            current and impending exchange proposals, the Department of Defense
                            might never know when its interests were involved in any specific
                            exchange proposal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that this
                            was certainly fair enough, and a very good suggestion. Indeed, all
                            interested departments and agencies should be kept informed of impending
                            exchange proposals so that they could assert their right to a voice in
                            the matter. On the other hand, he could not approve of a large board
                            made up of representatives of all the conceivably interested
                            departments, where every one of these individuals would have to be heard
                            on every single proposal, whether his department had any specific
                            interest or responsibility for the proposal or not. Such a large
                            implementing board would serve to diffuse responsibility to a point
                            which would assure that nothing would happen under the new policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Weeks said he had one additional suggestion to make. These
                            other departments should not merely be kept informed, but kept informed
                            in such a way that they would be given an opportunity to provide advice
                            to the Departments of State and Justice before a decision on any given
                            exchange proposal had been made.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he had no
                            objection to this suggestion either, but he assumed that Secretary Weeks
                            would not be particularly interested in a proposal for an exchange of
                            musicians between the U.S. and the USSR. Secretary Weeks replied that he
                            would have none whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented that the discussion had certainly brought
                            out what the Council wished to have done by way of a coordinating group.
                            Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he would circulate
                            appropriate language to indicate the Council’s wishes in this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then invited the Council’s attention to
                            the problems raised for the implementation of the proposed new policy on
                            East-West exchanges by existing statutes, and most notably by the
                            requirement that foreign nationals visiting the United States
                            unofficially must be fingerprinted. He invited the comments of the
                            Attorney General on these impediments.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General first inquired whether the implementation mechanism
                            just agreed to by the Council was designed to cover exchanges under all
                            the seventeen points listed in the annex to the proposed new policy. He
                            said he wished to be sure that this was the <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234"
                                facs="0264"/>case, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied in the affirmative. The Attorney General
                            then went on to emphasize the two special concerns of the Department of
                            Justice with respect to the proposed new policy— first, the problem of
                            internal security posed by the admission of more Soviet and satellite
                            citizens; and secondly, the requirement in the Immigration and
                            Nationality Act for the fingerprinting of nonimmigrants applying for
                            visas to enter the United States temporarily. These two conditions, said
                            the Attorney General, would pose problems in carrying out an expanded
                            program of East-West contacts. The fingerprinting problem would be
                            particularly difficult, and the Congress was unlikely to change the law
                            requiring fingerprinting, even though this move had been recommended by
                            the President.<note n="6" xml:id="d103fn6">This was one of several

                            said that we would presently find ourselves back in the familiar
                            position of requiring the fingerprinting of all non-official visitors to
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he
                            had long been sympathetic with the suggestion that the fingerprinting
                            requirement be dropped from existing law. His position, he said, did not
                            derive from Soviet criticism of the fingerprinting requirement, but from
                            the complaints of nations friendly to the United States. He also agreed
                            that it was extremely difficult to draw any real line between official
                            and non-official Soviet visitors. For the time being, our only recourse
                            was to try to persuade the Soviets to accept the fingerprinting
                            requirement.</p>
                        <p>As for the internal security problem, which would be increased under the
                            proposed new policy, the Attorney General said the most difficult aspect
                            was the provision of effective monitoring of the Soviet visitors under
                            an exchange program. Obviously the Soviet Government did use these
                            delegations for its own particular purposes—espionage and the like.
                            Therefore it was essential that we keep track of these people. The
                            previous practice of selecting monitors from outside the Government had
                            not been successful. Many of the monitors provided by private U.S.
                            agencies failed on the job. In the future, therefore, monitors of a
                            given exchange must be chosen from within the ranks of the Government.
                            This was one reason why the Department of Justice would have to have a
                            hand in carrying out the proposed new policy.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President then inquired whether the expansion of East-West
                            exchanges, as proposed in this policy statement, would require
                            additional funds for the Department of Justice to carry out its
                            responsibilities. The Attorney General said that additional funds <pb
                                n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0265"/>would be required if there were
                            any notable increase in Soviet and satellite visitors to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> inquired whether Mr. <persName>J. Edgar
                                Hoover</persName> wished to add anything to the statement just made
                            by the Attorney General. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> said that he agreed with and, indeed, would like
                            to emphasize what the Attorney General had said, and particularly his
                            expression of concern about the internal security aspects of adopting
                            this proposed new policy. He proceeded to cite a number of instances in
                            which Soviet visitors to the United States had engaged in espionage
                            activities in the course of the last six months. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> also stressed his belief that
                            each proposed exchange should be scrutinized and judged on its merits.
                            On the other hand, he agreed with the foreign policy objectives set
                            forth by the Secretary of State as underlying the proposed new
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Vice President’s question about the need for additional
                            funds for the Department of Justice, Director <persName corresp="#p_BP2"
                                >Brundage</persName> inquired of the Secretary of State how large a
                            number of Soviet and satellite visitors could be expected when the
                            proposed new policy began to be implemented. Would the increase in
                            numbers be so large as to involve budgetary implications? Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that he
                            doubted whether the number would be so large as to have severe budgetary
                            implications. He certainly neither expected the United States to be
                            flooded with Russian visitors nor the USSR with American visitors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then asked Mr. <persName>J. Walter
                                Yeagley</persName>, Chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on
                            Internal Security, whether he wished to add anything. Mr.
                                <persName>Yeagley</persName> expressed agreement with the views set
                            forth previously by the Attorney General and the Chairman of the
                            Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference. He informed the Council that
                            the internal security committees were now engaged in working out
                            criteria for the successful implementation of the proposed new policy
                            from the point of view of internal security. He did not believe that
                            these new criteria would impair the effectiveness of the new policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then explained the editorial changes in
                            the draft statement of policy unanimously recommended by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board in the memorandum of
                            June 19, 1956, to the National Security Council. The Council promptly
                            agreed to accept these clarifications.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> went on to deal with recommendations
                            proposed by individual members of the Planning Board dealing with more
                            substantive matters. He first described a proposal by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> member of the Planning Board, concurred
                            in by the Justice observer, for the insertion of a new sentence at the
                            end of paragraph 9, reading as follows: <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> suggested that this language
                            represented a somewhat more restricted approach to East-West exchanges,
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> member strongly
                            believed that each proposed exchange should be judged on its individual
                            merit. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> wondered
                            if this language was really necessary, in view of similar language in
                            paragraph 16 of the present paper. The Attorney General also thought the
                            proposed new language too restricted, even though his representative on
                            the Planning Board had concurred in it. Mr. <persName>Cooley</persName>,
                            representing the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, stated
                            his willingness to drop the proposed amendment and to go along with the
                            views of the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then pointed out the next proposed
                            amendment, proposed by the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> member of
                            the Planning Board as a new paragraph 11. The objective of this
                            amendment was to call attention to the importance of a clear
                            understanding of the new policy by the American public as well as by the
                            peoples of third countries. There was included a warning against
                            overzealous friendliness by U.S. citizens to visitors who might in many
                            cases be hostile agents. Mr. <persName>Cooley</persName> explained that
                            the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> member of the Planning Board had
                            in mind the need for guidance to U.S. hosts to Soviet visitors,
                            especially visitors to important U.S. industrial plants.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he perfectly well understood the need to
                            indoctrinate the American people as to the elements of danger in these
                            exchanges, but he did not believe that it was necessary to include this
                            matter in the statement of policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said he also agreed strongly with the thought
                            behind this proposed new paragraph, but concurred in the view of the
                            Vice President that it was unnecessary to put such a warning in a policy
                            paper. In general, it had not been the practice of the National Security
                            Council to include implementation tactics in a policy statement.
                            Accordingly, the proposal for a new paragraph 11 was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> then invited the Council’s attention to
                            the important proposal by the Defense member of the Planning Board—
                            concurred in by the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> member and the
                            JCS adviser—for a new version of the existing paragraph, designed to
                            emphasize the dangers inherent in the new policy with respect to third
                            countries and with respect to the military, political and economic
                            cooperation of the countries of the free world. The proposed Defense
                            paragraph 10 read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    a type of exchange which to other countries would be poisonous.
                                    Also, it is recognized that our embarking upon this policy may
                                    have a serious impact upon our capacity to maintain present
                                    military alliances and trade controls and involves taking a

                                    mitigate these effects as much as possible, we must exert

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> insisted that all

                            new policy; nor was there any need to set forth in a policy paper an

                            against adopting a new policy, then it made equally good sense to set
                            forth all the reasons in favor of adopting a new policy, the more so
                            since it seemed to the Secretary of State that the National Security
                            Council had virtually decided to adopt the proposed new policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out
                            that while the proposed new paragraph 10 seemed quite long when it had
                            been read, actually there were only one or two sentences in addition to
                            what had been stated in the original paragraph 10. Nevertheless,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0268"/>thought these additional
                            sentences were of very great significance. It might be true that the
                            Secretary of State and other members of the Council would heed the
                            warnings of the dangers in this new policy, but at the working levels at
                            which the policy would actually be carried out, it was necessary to
                            avoid a tendency to “soften up”. The inclusion of the stronger warning
                            language proposed by the Department of Defense would serve to check any
                            softening-up process. Accordingly, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated his belief that the
                            substitute paragraph 10 proposed by the Defense Department was a
                            distinct improvement over the original paragraph 10.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> supported the
                            views of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>,
                            and again emphasized his conviction of the need for a clear public
                            explanation of our objectives in adopting this new policy, as opposed to
                            mere private conversations designed to explain our objectives to third
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                            seemed to him that in this matter the Council was trying to ride two
                            horses. We all know that there is a risk in the adoption of this
                            proposed program for increasing exchanges and contacts between the U.S.
                            and the USSR. We had known this at least since the time of the Geneva
                            Summit Conference. Accordingly, we have simply got to weigh the
                            advantages of the new proposal as against its disadvantages, and make a
                            clear choice. He personally favored taking the risks which were inherent
                            in the new proposal. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> invited Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> to remember that the groups of people which the
                            USSR would be sending to the United States under the new policy, would
                            be in every sense controlled by the Soviet Government. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he was quite
                            aware of that, but that nevertheless we were still obliged to run the
                            risk. There was certainly a chance that these increased exchanges would
                            have a real effect on the people of the Soviet Union, and might play a
                            real part in convincing the Soviets of the errors of their system.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that all the
                            same, adoption of this new policy constituted a very great gamble for
                            the United States. He then went on to point out that if the U.S.
                            Government restricted itself to explaining to governments of third
                            countries, on a strictly confidential basis, the true objectives of the
                            United States in adopting a policy of increased exchanges with the
                            Soviet Union, the governments of these third countries would be unable
                            to explain to their citizens the true motives of the United States. As a
                            result, there <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0269"/>would be a clamor
                            in these third countries to admit Soviet visitors, with citations of the
                            example set by the United States itself.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out to
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that
                            confidential conversations with other governments was not the only
                            possible avenue by which we could explain the objectives of this
                            increased exchange program to the governments of third countries. … the
                            State Department would make public statements explaining the new policy
                            wherever it appropriately could.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stated that
                            the objective of the Department of Defense in its substitute paragraph
                            10 was simply to state publicly that despite the increased contacts
                            between the U.S. and the USSR, there remained major unresolved issues
                            between the United States and the USSR. This was a useful warning to the
                            free world and to our own people.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President commented that Defense and <gloss target="#t_ODM1"
                                >ODM</gloss>, in supporting the new paragraph 10, were in effect
                            simply seeking some public indoctrination as to the objectives of the
                            new policy. As of the present time, we might all agree with the type of
                            indoctrination proposed in paragraph 10. On the other hand, what we may
                            wish to say publicly about these objectives would certainly be
                            susceptible to change from time to time in the future. Moreover,
                            continued the Vice President, those who are likely to make public
                            statements about the objectives of this policy are, of course, the
                            people who are gathered around the Council table this morning. If a
                            clear understanding exists among these top spokesmen as to the risks and
                            dangers of increased U.S.-USSR contacts, this was about all that we
                            needed or could ask for. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had certainly stressed these dangers in his
                            speech at the Kiwanis convention.<note n="7" xml:id="d103fn7">For text

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName> commented that
                            if, in proposing its new paragraph 10, the Department of Defense was not
                            really trying to change the proposed new policy but merely calling for a
                            heightened public understanding of the policy, he could see no reason
                            for not putting in a reference to educating the people of the United
                            States into the present paragraph 17.</p>
                        <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> professed himself
                            still greatly worried about the probable inability of the governments of
                            third countries effectively to explain to their people why the United
                            States was showing a marked increase in its willingness to receive
                            Soviet visitors and to send U.S. citizens to the Soviet Union. With some
                            asperity, the Secretary of State informed Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> that the problem to which he
                            had just referred was part and parcel of the daily routine of the
                            Department of State. The problem of explanation of policy to the other
                            governments was the responsibility each day of State Department
                            officials. The State Department did not make a practice of telling the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Defense Department what kind of bombers,
                            missiles or submarines to make. Accordingly, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he would appreciate it if
                            the Department of Defense would trust the Department of State to
                            exercise appropriately its functions and duties.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed his
                            agreement with the view just stated by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, and again pointed out that we
                            cannot avoid a certain risk if we adopt this policy. If the Council was
                            not willing to take the risk, it should simply not adopt the new
                            statement of policy.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to
                            express further concern as to the effect of adopting the proposed new
                            policy, this time because of its possibly serious effect on our military
                            alliances. Speaking with firmness, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> expressed the opinion that the recent adoption
                            by the National Security Council of a more liberal point of view with
                            respect to the problem of East-West trade<note n="8" xml:id="d103fn8"
                                >Reference is to a decision taken at the 282d meeting of the
                                National Security Council on April 26.</note> had been a mistake.
                            Sir <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony Eden</persName> had gone back to
                            England and was playing fast and loose with the understanding he had
                            reached with us in the matter of British trade with the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied heatedly
                            that if the National Security Council had made a mistake in its recent
                            decisions in the matter of East-West trade, it was a mistake made not
                            only by the Council but by the President of the United States. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did not believe that
                            it was appropriate to criticize the President.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JWH1">William Jackson</persName>
                            again undertook briefly to summarize the basic philosophy upon which the
                            proposed new policy rested. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> pointed out that in effect the proposed new
                            program of increased East-West exchanges marked a point of departure for
                            a quite new U.S. policy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. The real question
                            was whether we were going to go to war with the Soviet Union or whether
                            we were going to live with them. Up to now we have been trying to do a
                            little of both at one and the <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"
                            />same time. We can no longer do so, and are now called upon to make our
                            choice. We cannot have our cake and eat it too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> pointed out
                            that the Defense Department was in agreement that we must take the risks
                            inherent in the adoption of this new policy. Nevertheless he stressed
                            again that we should not leave out the necessity for a clear public
                            statement or statements as to our objectives. He then asked whether the
                            Council would be willing at least to accept the first three sentences of
                            the Department of Defense version of paragraph 10 as designed to stress
                            the nature of the risk we were taking.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired whether there was objection to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>’s request.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> commented that
                            if embarking upon this new policy involved the risks which Defense
                            wished to emphasize, it was equally true that refusal by the U.S. to
                            embark on this policy might have very serious repercussions in the realm
                            of foreign policy. The Vice President remarked that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>, so it seemed to him, merely
                            wanted to add a <hi rend="italic">caveat</hi> against going overboard
                            with the new policy. He could at any rate see no objection to the
                            inclusion of the first sentence of the Defense Department version of
                            paragraph 10. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that he had no objection to the inclusion of this first
                            sentence.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that he shared personally much of the concern
                            shown by the Department of Defense over the impact of this policy on our
                            alliances and on political and economic cooperation among the countries
                            of the free world. In fact, however, the Council was really beyond the
                            point of arguing. The President had already indicated strongly his views
                            in favor of taking the risk. Discussion by the Council this morning had
                            been of value in informing those whose task it would be in the future to
                            implement the new policy. It furthermore seemed to the Vice President
                            that the inclusion of the first sentence of the Defense Department
                            version of paragraph 10, combined with the Council discussion, provided
                            adequate guidance to the Secretary of State in carrying out this
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State again said he had no objection to the inclusion of
                            this sentence, and the Vice President asked Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> if this satisfied the
                            Defense Department. The Vice President went on to say that he sensed a
                            basic disagreement between the Department of State and the Department of
                            Defense. This disagreement had been thoroughly aired and discussed, and
                            the Vice President believed that the Council could go no further. If it
                            did, the paper would have to go to the President with a split view, and
                            the President would almost certainly accept the language for paragraph
                            10 as set forth in the original version.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> made one more
                            effort to explain the Defense position. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> likewise again pointed out
                            that <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0272"/>the fact of the matter was
                            that this Government was directly and significantly changing its
                            policies toward the Soviet bloc, and that we should frankly recognize
                            this important fact.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, and said that
                            the actual change in our policy had been made at Geneva in accordance
                            with the President’s own decision. Under the Constitution of the United
                            States we therefore had no other choice than to follow the President’s
                            decision. If in point of fact the new policy on exchanges works badly,
                            there will be ample opportunity to change it. We have by no means frozen
                            our course. If the Department of Defense or the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            thought at some future time that the new policy operated to our
                            disadvantage, they should come and tell us so frankly, and we can work
                            it out. There was always a forum for an appeal, and nothing catastrophic
                            was going to happen as a result of the adoption of this new policy.</p>

                                that it is profitable to Tito, encourages those within the satellite

                                Powers submitted a well-rounded 17-point proposal which reflected
                                the above thinking. This was rejected by the Soviet Union which,
                                however, indicated that it might be prepared to develop East-West
                                exchanges along the indicated lines on the basis of bilateral

                                neutral position incident to passing upon Soviet initiatives, or the
                                initiatives of private groups within the United States. Of course,
                                Soviet initiatives should be accepted, and the private U.S.
                                initiatives should be welcomed, whenever they advance U.S. policy or

                            <item>One aspect of this matter which requires particular consideration
                                is the impact of what we do upon third countries as well as upon
                                military, political and economic cooperation among the countries of
                                the free world. In many cases, the United States can tolerate a type
                                of exchange which to other countries would be poisonous.
                                Consideration should be given to explaining to third countries, on a
                                confidential basis, the scope and purpose of our program and the
                                precautions we would take, so that they will not misconstrue what we
                                do as evidence that we believe that Soviet purposes have now become
                                benign. This could be done, for example, as regards the American
                                Republics at a meeting of the Ambassadors, such as we have had with
                                increasing frequency in recent months. There could be similar
                                expositions made on a selective basis with friendly countries of
                                Africa and Asia. In this way, it could be made clear that what we do
                                is a part of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> policy designed to weaken
                                International Communism, and that it is not either an acquiescence
                                in Soviet policy or a recognition that Soviet motives have so
                                changed that they are no longer to be feared.</item>

                        <p>It was apparent that in showing us what they chose to show, the Soviet
                            leaders felt that they were being fairly open-handed. Certainly by
                            contrast with their previous habits of secrecy, they did let down the
                            bars somewhat. In point of fact, however, they gave us much less
                            information than is openly available to them about our own air force and
                            defense preparations. Though cordial, their air force leaders were
                            invariably unresponsive whenever we attempted to converse with them on
                            serious professional lines. Neither I nor other members of my party
                            succeeded in promoting a forthright exchange of views with anyone.</p>
                        <p>Such exposure of operational aircraft and prototypes as they elected to
                            make was done under conditions that permitted us only cursory
                            observation. (The aircraft and equipment that we saw are discussed in
                            the attached tab.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">The attachment, a 17-page
                                “Preliminary Report” on the visit of the U.S. Delegation, is not
                                printed.</note>) The Soviets permitted close-up inspection only of
                            those equipment items about which they had reason to suppose we already
                            possessed rather complete information, or which had no important
                            relationship to modern air combat capability; for example, their version
                            of the Nene jet engine and one of their air transport plants, which is
                            producing the IL–14.</p>
                        <p>With regard, therefore, to our first specific purpose—to measure at first
                            hand their current and potential air strength and their degree of
                            readiness for global war—we obtained no new information of significance.
                            In fact, in the critical areas of long-range bomber production,
                            defensive and offensive guided missile systems, and military
                            applications of nuclear energy as well as the size, composition and
                            location of operational forces and modern industrial installations, we
                            encountered a blank wall. Nevertheless, the inspection of their aircraft
                            and equipment, limited as it was, will enable us to refine some of our
                            estimates of the quality and performance of Soviet air weapons. In this
                            respect our trip was profitable. Further, the contacts with key Soviet
                            military personalities permitted the <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                facs="0278"/>members of the group to form some opinion as to their
                            professional competence.</p>
                        <p>As to the Soviet air potential in the years ahead, our visit
                            substantially strengthened previous assessments that the U.S.S.R. can
                            reduce and is, in fact, progressively reducing the technological lead of
                            the West generally and the United States in particular.</p>
                        <p>The factors supporting this judgment include (a) their emphasis on a
                            thorough technical training of a large number of carefully selected
                            personnel; (b) the variety of aircraft under development; (c) their
                            ability to squeeze the maximum potential from a jet engine of Western
                            origin and at the same time to develop powerful new engines on their
                            own; and (d) the rapid rate of progress they have shown during the last
                            few years in the research and development field.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, given the heavy emphasis which they are placing upon the
                            creation of a new technical generation, beginning with primary education
                            and carrying through basic research and engineering development, we must
                            reckon on the possibility of their achieving a scientific breakthrough
                            and consequent technological surprise in new weapons.</p>
                        <p>Concerning our second specific purpose—to gauge Soviet intentions in the
                            matter of future military visits, as well as their motives in our
                            particular instance—these three points can be made: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Soviet officials at all levels repeatedly voiced the hope that
                                    our visit would be the first of a series of encounters leading
                                    to wider exchange of information. They plainly desire an early
                                    invitation to visit the United States.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The nature of the Soviet overtures definitely indicates a
                                    desire to establish a pattern for the exchange of military
                                    information on their terms as a counter to the U.S. proposal for
                                    aerial inspection, which they continue to reject.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Judging from the political and propaganda treatment given our
                                    visit, from the studied emphasis on defensive weapons displayed,
                                    and from statements made to us, the motives behind this first
                                    invitation were to further the general Soviet foreign policy
                                    line of reduction of armaments, and the lessening of
                                    international tensions, with the ultimate purpose of weakening
                                    the Free World’s alliance system.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Concerning our third specific purpose—to appraise the reaction of other
                            delegations—the representatives of countries in the Soviet orbit, so far
                            as we were in a position to judge, associated themselves with the
                            general Soviet line. With regard to our allies, the representatives of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations appeared to look to
                            the United States for leadership. Their outward attitude was, in effect,
                            “You show us the way. We’ll follow.” The British delegation acted
                            somewhat more <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0279"/>independently. We
                            believe, however, that in general the members of the RAF delegation are
                            in accord with our views.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation</hi></p>
                        <p>I am not prepared, of course, to render advice concerning the numerous
                            political factors that must be taken into account in measuring the
                            desirability of future reciprocal military visits. From a military
                            viewpoint, however, my judgment is that the Soviets would undoubtedly
                            gain from visits to the United States useful knowledge of air techniques
                            and equipment, while we on our side would gain only to the extent that
                            they can be persuaded to raise the curtain around their military
                            establishment on subsequent visits by us.</p>
                        <p>If, therefore, it should be the decision of the United States Government
                            to adopt a policy of reciprocal military visits, I recommend that such
                            visits be under the following conditions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That they be started with a clear understanding that they will
                                    be on a trial basis, subject to a more convincing show of
                                    forthrightness on the part of the Soviet Union.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That their visits to the United States be under appropriate
                                    military supervision.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That such visits be carefully controlled with a view toward
                                    bringing our knowledge of the Soviet air position up to a level
                                    corresponding to their knowledge of ours.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>That consideration be given to the advisability of widening
                                    any invitations that the U.S. might extend to include nations of
                                    our alliance system as well as Soviet satellites, rather than
                                    confining this to a bilateral arrangement between the U.S. and
                                    the U.S.S.R.</item>

                                    elections. Everyone concerned is for it—but the reason the Sec.
                                    is clearing the matter with the Pres. is we may think it
                                    important to clear it with the Democrats. It will be done
                                    through the Heritage Foundation. The Pres. does not see how they
                                    can make a political football of it. He would not mind taking it

                                <p>“The Sec. asked if he mentioned the project to <persName

                                    he will go ahead.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</p></note>
                            This letter was for the purpose of informing him of the Department’s
                            proposal to invite two or three representatives of the Soviet bloc
                            countries to come to the United States for a fifteen-day period in order
                            to familiarize themselves with the two-party electoral process whereby
                            the Chief Executive and members of Congress are chosen. No one else was
                            present. Governor <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> read
                            the letter with great care. I explained the advantages we consider can
                            be derived from these invitations, whether accepted or not. He then
                            became interested in the whole exchange program and asked me to describe
                            the workings of the Immigration law and the part the fingerprinting
                            requirement plays. This I did, and pointed out, inter alia, that the
                            Soviet Government’s refusal to permit their nationals to be
                            fingerprinted was being used by them as a means to control the travel of
                            their citizens to the United States. However, our Government had granted
                            a number of special visas to those documented as officials, in instances
                            wherein the visit was in our interest, and thus some sixty or so Soviet
                                <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0281"/>citizens had actually come
                            here this year to international congresses and as a result of exchange
                            visits.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> then asked me
                            what were the negative aspects of the proposal. I said there seemed to
                            be only two. One involved the possibility of demonstrations,
                            particularly by citizens of Eastern European extraction, and the other
                            the presumption that upon return home the visitors would report
                            unfavorably on our electoral processes. I explained that the first
                            objection could be avoided by careful planning of the itinerary. In the
                            case of the second, our media outlets would be able to counter such
                            reports, perhaps by playing back actual quotes made while here. In any
                            case, it was hardly likely that the captive peoples, particularly in the
                            satellites, would believe critical reports, which incidentally they
                            would be getting from their own media anyway. He warned that in the
                            closing stages of the campaign there might be a spate of extreme
                            anti-communist statements by various candidates, which might be
                            considered insulting by the guests. To my expression of belief that this
                            campaign would not find communism a major issue, he replied Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was forcing it on
                            him and that he was not too sanguine it would not become one. He added
                            he himself had no intention of exacerbating the issue of communists in
                            government. (These remarks were obviously prompted by the press
                            conference he had held yesterday.)<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">Not

                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had
                            knowledge of and approved the <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of
                            inviting the Soviet bloc representatives, and that as a matter of course
                            it was thought desirable he also be apprised of it. In order that there
                            might be no misunderstanding as to why, I said that the possibility had
                            been considered that the arrival of Soviet bloc representatives in this
                            country could become a partisan issue in the campaign. He said he did
                            not think it would, and it was quite clear from the way he expressed
                            himself that he for one would not criticize the administration in this
                            respect. He did add, however, that certain local candidates with
                            minority constituents might indulge themselves. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA1">Stevenson</persName> then offered the opinion that
                            the invitation was a “good <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss>”,
                            particularly as it gave both the opportunity to the communists to view
                            free elections and also to us to ask for reciprocity. He said he would
                            be very glad to receive the visiting delegations, but hoped it could be
                            limited to one occasion in view of the great pressures he would be under
                            at the closing stages of the campaign.</p>

                            other arrangements would probably be made by the Government Affairs

                        <p>On September 28, the Department of State announced that it had recently
                            issued invitations through its missions abroad to the Governments of the
                            Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania to send
                            representatives to the United States in October “to view at first hand
                            the free electoral processes in this country.” The Department indicated
                            that it assumed, on the basis of reciprocity, that Americans would be
                            invited to view elections in their countries on the next appropriate
                            occasion. For text of the announcement, as well as that of the formal

                            29, the Soviet Government accepted the invitation and invited American
                            representatives to visit the Soviet Union during the election of the

                            to the Soviet Union, Romania had also accepted the invitation, but that
                            Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had declined. The Department also
                            announced the composition of the Soviet Delegation, which was to arrive

                            in America had “strengthened our conviction in the superiority of our

                            them. Under <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0285"/>Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that the decision to
                            suspend the exchanges had been made in discussion with the President
                            following the Hungarian crisis and that it was to be a “temporary
                            suspension pending clarification and a new evaluation of the situation.”
                            It was decided that in any discussion with the press on this subject, it
                            should be emphasized that the suspension was temporary and “the
                            inference should be avoided that our past policy of exchanges has been
                            dictated by any desire to help the USSR at the expense of the U.S.”
                            (Department of State, Secretary’s Staff Meetings: Lot 63 D 75) Later
                            that day, the following responses were given by a Department of State
                            spokesman to questions raised about the possible suspension of East-West
                            exchanges at the Department’s press briefing: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>“A. Well, in view of recent developments, proposed Governmental
                                    exchanges with the Soviet Union have been suspended during a
                                    reappraisal of the program. This reappraisal is continuing.</p>
                                <p>“Q. When was the decision made?</p>
                                <p>“A. I don’t have any specific date. It has been some weeks.</p>

                                    Exchanges’ and this refers—as I have made clear—specifically to
                                    US-USSR exchanges.</p>
                                <p>“Q. Have we told the Soviet Governmental authorities to whom we
                                    have been proposing these exchanges, about our decision to
                                    suspend this program?</p>

                            been queried on its intentions with regard to several technical

                            and EWC share the British view that exchanges with the U.S.S.R. should
                            be resumed on a gradual basis; there remains the question of the method
                            and timing of resumption.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName> was informed
                            that American public opinion, (as reflected by recent polls), most
                            editorial comment, and the views of American intellectual and scientific
                            circles were in favor of resumption. It was the Ambassador’s view that
                            if the American public would support exchanges with the Soviet Union, as
                            appeared to be the case, then he would favor resumption as in the
                            national interest. If there is general agreement to resume, the
                            Ambassador felt no useful purpose would be served by linking resumption
                            to Soviet behavior in Eastern Europe or to current Soviet attacks on the
                            United States in the General Assembly. While it is desirable on
                            appropriate occasions to combat the Soviet standard line on East-West
                            exchanges by stressing our belief that exchanges can fruitfully take
                            place only in a favorable political environment and cannot as the
                            Soviets contend create such an atmosphere, the issue now is whether we
                            should resume exchanges or not. If it is agreed that it is <pb n="257"
                                xml:id="pg_257" facs="0287"/>in the national interest to do so, we
                            should not attempt to make resumption conditional on certain changes in
                            Soviet behavior, notwithstanding the propaganda opportunities inherent
                            in such an approach. He would recommend that no formal reply be made to
                            the Soviet Aide-Mémoire; that, instead, the Soviet Embassy be permitted
                            to deduce from the Department’s actions that the suspension was lifted.
                            He would agree that a suitable first step would be for the Department to
                            inform the Soviet Embassy that the American mass feeding delegation was
                            now ready to return the visit of the Soviet group last fall.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was careful to point out that the policy should not be one
                            of full scale resumption without qualification. He felt we should
                            proceed cautiously in order not to find ourselves confronted with the
                            necessity of a further suspension in the event, as is very possible,
                            that Soviet behavior in Poland or increased anti-United States campaign
                            would require such action. In short, he believed we should start very
                            slowly and be guided in the development of a program for exchanges by
                            future Soviet behavior and the state of our relations with the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCEC1">Bohlen</persName> felt that
                            although American cultural performances in the U.S.S.R. are useful in
                            combating the Soviet charge that the U.S. is a cultural desert and
                            personal contacts between scholars and scientists have merit, exchanges
                            of technical delegations are the most beneficial to the United
                            States.…Tourism he felt had little impact on Soviet society, and while
                            he had no objection to controlled student exchanges he did not share the
                            British estimate of potential gain in this field. Although there had
                            been signs of recent student unrest in the Soviet Union, he was
                            convinced that disaffection had not and would not reach such proportions
                            as to represent a real threat to the Soviet social order. He did not
                            feel that the Soviet regime would have to resort to coercive measures to
                            cope with this problem. Because of the hunger of Soviet youth for
                            education and its awareness that only through education could their
                            status in Soviet society be improved, the threat of expulsion for
                            non-conformism would be adequate.</p>
                        <p>As to cultural exchanges, the Ambassador felt the American position
                            should rest not only on Soviet unwillingness to comply with the
                            fingerprinting requirement but also on the hostility of American public
                            opinion to the Soviet Union at the present time. By mentioning the
                            latter, we would prepare the ground for official discouragement (for
                            security or other reasons) of a large-scale Soviet cultural invasion in
                            the event the fingerprinting requirement should be lifted at the current
                            session of Congress.</p>

                            exchanges with the USSR some time this spring. We believe it would be
                            natural and unobtrusive to resume exchanges with the Russians by
                            claiming from them their reciprocal obligations to receive American mass
                            feeding experts in the USSR this spring. Russian mass feeding experts
                            (concerned with Army feeding techniques, disaster relief feeding, large
                            institutional provisioning) visited the United States last fall; the
                            reciprocal visit of the US experts to Russia was cancelled by our
                            suspension of exchanges with the USSR.<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">Not

                        <p>During the coming seven or eight months, we propose to effect exchanges
                            with the USSR in the fields of iron and steel technology, coal mining,
                            peat mining, and public health. The British are also very much
                            interested in resuming their exchange program with the USSR, for reasons
                            similar to ours. You will recollect that this was discussed with

                        <p>1. Possible student exchange with the Soviet Union and other East
                            European countries has been under active consideration ever since the
                            Geneva Conference. One of the 17 proposals put forward by the three
                            Western Foreign Ministers at Geneva on October 31, 1955, specifically
                            called for exchange of students.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">See <ref

                            June 29, 1956, the President approved the recommendation of the National
                            Security Council that the U.S. should seek exchanges with the countries
                            of Eastern Europe, including the USSR,<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3"><ref
                                    target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> along the lines of the

                            the initiative in suggesting exchange of students as a topic for
                            negotiations in the overall discussions on exchanges scheduled for late
                            October.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. fingerprinting requirements, which had previously frustrated any
                            student exchanges with the Soviet bloc, have now been amended by
                            Congress to permit waiver of these requirements for visits of less than
                            12 months, and the necessary implementing action has already been taken
                            by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d112fn5">On October 10 the Department of State announced

                            General that he waive inadmissibility for Soviet bloc exchangees who are
                            members of the Communist Party or affiliated organizations, since it is
                            anticipated that the majority of the bloc exchangees will be members of
                            such organizations.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus, at the present time there are at last indications that a modest
                            student exchange program might be successfully arranged with the Soviet
                            Union and other East European governments.</p>
                        <p>5. Two concrete projects to comprise a government-financed student
                            exchange program with the Soviet Union and other East European countries
                            have been submitted to the Special Committee on Soviet and Related
                            Problems in order to achieve full interagency understanding of, and
                            support for, the program. The two projects, both of which would be
                            sponsored by the Department of State, are complementary, though somewhat
                            different in scope.</p>
                        <p>6. The first project has been drawn up by the International Educational
                            Exchange Service of the Bureau of Public Affairs of the Department of
                            State, in conjunction with the East-West Contacts Staff. This project
                            calls for an extension to Eastern Europe of the rather extensive program
                            of educational exchange with friendly and neutral countries which has
                            been underway for some years under the terms of Public Law 402.<note

                            the U.S. of around $26,000,000. Except for a small program recently
                            launched with Yugoslavia, all IES exchanges have been with non-Communist
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>7. Here is a brief summary of the IES project as submitted to the Special
                            Committee. It is apparent that the plan calls for a pilot operation
                            only. Moreover, details of the plan are quite tentative, and its
                            administration must be quite flexible. <list>

                                    17 research scholars, and nine teachers. An effort will be made
                                    in administering the program to see that there is adequate

                            “beginning.” The Commission stresses the need for caution and
                            flexibility, and “accepts the assurance of the Department that exchanges
                            will be carried out only as it is determined that this can be done on
                            the basis of reciprocity, as Congress intended, and with adequate
                            provisions for sufficient freedom of movement and protection of the
                            educational content of such exchanges as to warrant a reasonable
                            expectation that the goals prescribed by Congress for these programs can
                            be achieved.”</p>

                                    exchange with Communist countries has already been manifest. The

                        <p>12. The Special Committee on Soviet and Related Problems finds that the
                            program for student and educational exchanges with the USSR and other
                            countries of Eastern Europe set forth in the two projects proposed by
                            the International Exchange Service and the East-West Contacts Staff of
                            the Department of State, and outlined in paragraphs 7 and 9 above, is a
                            logical, timely, and highly desirable first step in the right direction
                            and recommends that the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> concur in
                            this finding.</p>

                            to begin in Washington on October 28. He summarized U.S.-USSR exchanges
                            for the past few years and noted several of the disadvantages arising
                            from legislative and Department of Justice requirements. It was pointed
                            out that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5607<note n="3"

                            charges the Department with its implementation in conjunction with the
                            Department of Justice, and that both Departments were directed to
                            develop and apply internal security safeguards. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> stated the present system, which
                            requires that the Department secure sponsors for Soviet bloc visitors,
                            has been burdensome and disliked by American schools and individuals who
                            have undertaken to act in this capacity.</p>
                        <p>The exchange proposals were presented to the Board. In one, the U.S. and
                            USSR would exchange 100 students for a period of six weeks in the summer
                            of 1958 or later at a cost of about $100,000. The second proposal was
                            for a U.S.-Soviet European bloc exchange of 114 persons, students and
                            teachers for one year, leaders and specialists for six months. The
                            latter program would cost about $550,000. It was generally agreed that
                            the objectives of both programs accord with <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA1"
                                >Larson</persName> stated his conviction that a six-week program is
                            much too short to be effective and suggested that anything less than a
                            year is inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> pointed out
                            that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy requires the U.S. to
                            take the initiative in such exchanges as a positive instrument of U.S.
                            foreign policy. Since the U.S. negotiators in the coming talks must know
                            the boundaries of their authority, particularly with regard to internal
                            security requirements, he said that the present State and Justice
                            positions would be discussed at the Cabinet meeting next week.</p>
                        <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>During the discussion of the financing of such programs, it was agreed
                            that no attempt should be made to seek funds or supplemental
                            appropriation for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58. Without
                            excluding the possibility of some funds being found within the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’58 exchange program, it was thought best
                            that East-West programs should be presented as part of <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ’59. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA1"
                                >Macy</persName> of the Budget Bureau said that he expects that in
                            the coming election year there will be quicker Congressional action on
                            budget requests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SA1">John Reilly</persName> (Justice) said that
                            he was under instructions from the Attorney General to say that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> could not take on the job of
                            surveillance. He also said that it was the view in Justice that there
                            were provisions in the Immigration and Naturalization Act which might
                            preclude group or category waivers.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that any East-West program should begin modestly; that the
                            exchanges should embrace not only the USSR but the European Soviet bloc;
                            and that flexibility in approach should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Later, the Under Secretary said that some formal action would be required
                            by agreement between the Secretary and the Attorney General or, failing
                            this, a determination by the President, as regards the surveillance and
                            waiver aspects of the exchanges. The Under Secretary asked that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> study this matter to
                            determine precisely the position which should be adopted by the
                            Secretary at the coming Cabinet meeting; also, that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> should set up a briefing of the
                            Secretary on this subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> prepared a memorandum for the

                                    >OCB</gloss> meeting and sent it to Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> as an attachment to a letter
                                dated October 16. In the memorandum <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                    >Cutler</persName> stated that the President apparently had
                                forgotten that the security regulations governing exchanges had been
                                discussed by the National Security Council the previous year, and
                                that <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> believed that it
                                was preferable to continue discussion of the issue, if the Secretary
                                of State and the Attorney General could not reach agreement, at the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> rather than the Cabinet
                                level. In a covering letter. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                    >Cutler</persName> wrote that the Attorney General had indicated
                                there had been no discussion with the Secretary of State since the
                                previous year about the regulations. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                    >Cutler</persName> suggested that <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Brownell</persName> meet to work out
                                revisions in the regulations and only if they were unsuccessful
                                would <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> schedule the
                                issue for discussion at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                        <p>The negotiations were discussed at the Secretary of State’s Staff meeting
                            on November 26, at which Under Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> presided. According to the notes
                            of the meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In reply to the Under Secretary’s comment on the rapid progress
                                    of the exchange negotiations with the Soviets, Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> stated that a slowdown of
                                    the negotiations was planned. He indicated that the Soviets were
                                    eager to obtain the rights for a direct flight over the Pole to
                                    the US, whereas we were desirous of obtaining a satisfactory
                                    agreement on radio-TV exchanges. Despite the considerable area
                                    of agreement there was some doubt in Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName>’s mind as to how
                                    faithfully these agreements would be carried out. He felt that
                                    we held an unusual advantage in these negotiations since we
                                    agreed in principle ad referendum to the appropriate American
                                    industry or association which would bear the final
                                    responsibility for the support of these exchanges. In response
                                    to a query from the Under Secretary, Mr. <persName

                            meeting of December 10, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LWSB1"
                                >Lacy</persName> reported that the talks “had slowed down to a crawl
                            in order that they could be protracted. Fifty separate exchanges have
                            been discussed, half introduced by the Russians and half by us. About
                            twenty-five have been agreed, generally in the ratio of one to one. The
                            outstanding item the Russians want is the right for direct airflights to
                            the US while the outstanding item we want is the right to present
                            American TV <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>and radio shows to
                            the Russian people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName>
                            believes that the Russians will accept part of our radio and TV offer in
                            the hope that we will agree to discuss direct airflights. It appears
                            that it may be possible to negotiate an improvement concerning the free

                            propaganda from the Soviet side about the progress of the talks. In some
                            instances the Russians had indicated that the talks were progressing
                            satisfactorily, while in other cases they were reported as being

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> spoke of the
                            landing of the Greek airmen on Cyprus and of the treatment they received
                            from the British authorities. Without stressing the incident, he
                            indicated that the British would not have acted as they did unless they
                            had general U.S. support on the Cyprus question. As a result of Greek
                            reaction his Government had had to cancel the visit of the British fleet
                            scheduled for June 2.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0302"/>
                        <p>On the overall Cyprus question the Greeks were exasperated because the
                            U.K. had not given them the island as promised in the past and because
                            of incidents such as the above. However the main source of
                            dissatisfaction was the belief that the U.S. supported the U.K. This was
                            causing a very serious situation in Greece and would affect Greece’s
                            support of U.S. policies. The Ambassador believed our position was due
                            to U.K. and French pressure and doubted if it reflected our real
                            feelings. He quoted the President as having told him he was surprised
                            that the U.K. had not found a solution to the problem.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d117fn2">Not further identified.</note> The Ambassador spoke
                            sincerely of his admiration for the U.S. and of his belief that with the
                            formation of Western Union, America’s freedom of action had been
                            increased. Only the U.S. could do something constructive about Cyprus.
                            He said Greece did not necessarily want public debate and desired to be
                            reasonable. This was a question on which it would be easy for the U.S.
                            to be on the right side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had sincere friendships for both Greece and
                            the U.K. and that we do not act arbitrarily. We act from one dominant
                            motive: our desire to keep the Free World free and strong. Greece knows
                            this from the time when she was in danger. It is not easy to keep a
                            coalition of free states together. Our actions are not due to
                            favoritism. It is incorrect to assume that our actions are dictated by
                            the U.K. Some things go on beneath the surface.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized two points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We pay careful and sympathetic heed to what has been
                                    said.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Our action will be based on what we think is the best way to
                                    meet the overriding peril of our time.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>We sympathize with the aspirations of those wanting self-determination.
                            We appeal to Greece to keep this matter within reasonable bounds.</p>

                                >Melas</persName> called in emotional state yesterday and denounced
                            UK invitation re Cyprus in bitter terms and at length, due to inclusion
                            of Turkey. He was informed that acceptance was naturally question for
                            Greek Government to determine but we felt his Government should consider
                            matter carefully and we hoped invitation would be accepted. He was
                            reminded that Greece should not make it difficult for her friends to
                            support her and that discussion of defense questions made inclusion of
                            Greece’s ally Turkey not inappropriate. He was in no way mollified and
                            went away repeating imprecations against UK for “once more following its
                            policy of divide and rule”.</p>
                        <p>You may inform Greek Government that … since our opinion is requested we
                            regard invitation as progressive step and believe it is important to
                            accept the invitation and enter negotiations in good faith. This is
                            first time British have been willing discuss Cyprus with other powers
                            and if Greeks refused offer they would not only lose sympathy but would
                            place themselves in difficult position as members of <gloss

                            matters. Greece, Turkey and UK have primary interest in area and to us
                            it seems eminently reasonable they <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274"

                            to urge <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to advance date
                            of conference to 10th or 15th and Secretary <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275"

                                >Macmillan</persName>. Secretary pointed out if Greeks did not table
                            Cyprus on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda before August 20,
                            they were not debarred from doing so later since they could always raise
                            question in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> under the “urgency”
                            procedure. <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> replied if meeting were
                            delayed to August 29 Greeks, for public opinion reasons, would have to
                            raise question at UNGA.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently Secretary spoke to <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> re Cyprus talks. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> said he could not advance the date of the
                            conference and that it was up to the Greeks to do what they wanted re
                            UNGA agenda. He thought that if they put Cyprus on the agenda before the
                            talks it would not be a friendly or constructive act but it was up to
                            them.</p>

                            but doubt Greeks equally prepared discuss matter constructively. Hope we

                            agenda, hope they can be disabused this score. 3. In Greece anti-British
                            propaganda re Cyprus continuing at high level despite Greek assurances
                            it would be toned down. U.K. would appreciate our pointing out to Greeks
                            forcefully as possible this does not help final solution.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> Secretary inquired whether British
                            have plan for Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName>

                        <p>You are requested make forceful presentation points contained paragraph 1
                            above. Manner presentation your discretion, but re point 3 suggest
                            discussion radio broadcasts to Cyprus.</p>

                        <p>You should also point out that continuing demonstrations and disorders in
                            Cyprus will have effect prejudicing Greek position in tripartite talks.
                            By sponsoring Cyprus cause in international forum and claiming right
                            speak for Cypriots with UK, Greece has implicitly assumed some
                            responsibility for Cypriot behavior. Greek Government protestations it
                            has no power influence Cypriots cannot be accepted at face value. This
                            is two way street. If Greek Government policies can be influenced by
                            pressures from Cypriots and ethnarchy it also has responsibility exert
                            influence on population Cyprus through all means available.<note n="3"

                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s tactics at forthcoming conference
                            regarding Cyprus would initially be to obtain formal declarations by
                            Greece and Turkey of their respective positions. Cabinet had taken no
                            decision about any hard and fast British plan but great deal of thought
                            had been given to problem and many combinations and permutations had
                            been considered. Therefore it could be “played by ear” following Greek
                            and Turkish declarations. He emphasized that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> certainly did not wish to produce a plan which would be
                            acceptable neither to Greece or Turkey and if Greece’s only position was
                            enosis in near future then conference would be abortive. On other hand
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> indicated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> was particularly <pb
                                n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0307"/>anxious to reach acceptable
                            solution. He said he understood that Greek cabinet was divided on issue
                            and in this connection he referred to recent articles in Turkish press
                            to effect that if Greece felt free to abrogate unilaterally Treaty of
                                Lausanne<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">On July 24, 1923, Turkey signed
                                a treaty of peace with Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Greece,
                                Yugoslavia, and Rumania. Among its other provisions, the Treaty of
                                Lausanne resulted in Turkish recognition of Britain’s 1914
                                annexation of Cyprus and the renunciation of Turkey’s claim to
                                control the island. For text of the treaty of Lausanne, see the
                                League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 28, p. 11.</note> there were
                            articles which Turkey for its part might wish to change. This has in
                            turn been taken up in Greek press.</p>
                        <p>Since British undoubtedly know what position Turkey will take at
                            Conference their tactics are obviously designed to force Greece to
                            define its attitude. If it is arbitrary and unreasonable Great Britain
                            will not have lost Turkey’s support. If it provides basis for compromise
                            meeting could well be productive.</p>

                                size-up of the situation, which is subject to confirmation as
                                further facts are known, is as follows. After Cypriot-Turkish
                                demonstration in London, the Turkish Government presumably felt it
                                important to have corresponding demonstrations in various points in
                                Turkey. Demonstrations got under way in Istanbul and Izmir
                                particularly, with the acquiescence <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
                                    facs="0315"/>of the local police. Rioting quickly got out of
                                hand and the police possibly had no instructions to take vigorous
                                action. Meanwhile rabble elements and professional looters took over
                                and looting became indiscriminate.</item>

                            <item>Although the primary target was Greek, the Armenians, Jews and
                                some foreigners had a rough time of it and even some Turks suffered.
                                Finally the army intervened and the mobs dispersed. The army will
                                probably continue to maintain order during the forthcoming Bank
                                conference; it is not probable that the representatives at the
                                conference are in any physical danger. Tanks and troops are very
                                much in evidence and will presumably be held ready to meet any
                                emergency.</item>

                            <item>Long range consequences are hard to judge and might be most
                                serious. Leading Turkish elements are apparently deeply humiliated
                                and distressed and there appears to be an opportunity to reestablish
                                situation without lasting harm to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                Greek reaction remains reasonably tempered. This will require wisdom
                                and restraint in a highly volatile and explosive situation. It is
                                doubtful that the Communists had a directing hand in this situation
                                but they undoubtedly will endeavor to profit by the general
                                confusion resulting from these incidents.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Greek Ambassador called today immediately after returning from his
                            participation in the London talks on Cyprus to recapitulate briefly the
                            course of the conference and its disappointing outcome. He said that
                            Greece had an absolutely clear conscience as to its behavior. It had
                            gone to London with the sincere intention of making a constructive
                            contribution and it had stated its views with <pb n="286"
                                xml:id="pg_286" facs="0316"/>such moderation as to evoke praise from
                            the British participants themselves. The Ambassador contrasted the Greek
                            restraint with the “fantastic” charges and wild statements made by the
                            Turks. The Greek record certainly proved, he said, that his country had
                            steadfastly based its policy on the ideals of that great statesman,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName>,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d128fn2">Eleutherios Venizelos, Greek statesman and former
                                Prime Minister.</note> whose vision had laid the foundations of
                            modem Greek-Turkish friendship. Furthermore, Greece had recently taken
                            the lead in bringing Yugoslavia into a Balkan Alliance when the memory
                            was still fresh of armed Communist aggression on Greece originating from
                            Yugoslav territory. The Ambassador could not accept, he stated
                            emphatically, any imputation that Greece had done anything to threaten
                            the security of Turkey or to justify the hostile Turkish attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his Government did not envisage success from a
                            conference to which Britain had invited a country which had no right to
                            discuss Cyprus. The Greeks had repeatedly given assurances of special
                            treatment for the Turkish minority, but the basic issue of the
                            self-determination of the Cypriots was a question to be discussed solely
                            by Great Britain and Greece. The Ambassador was convinced that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, who had worked so
                            hard to get these talks started had at no time envisaged that they would
                            be <hi rend="italic">tri</hi> partite.</p>
                        <p>The British proposals, when they were finally made, ostensibly suggested
                            self-government, but they were, according to the Ambassador, the very
                            negation of self-government: they recommended the establishment of a
                            control committee in London. This was nothing but a condominium
                            arrangement, in which the minority and the British would dominate the
                            majority (Greek) interest. As a further indication that the British were
                            not “serious” in their proposals, the Ambassador said that, in the final
                            London meeting, the Turks were “made to ask questions” which elicited
                            answers from the British Government to the effect that the question of
                            the international status of Cyprus or self-determination were not to be
                            discussed in the foreseeable future. This proved that, despite the
                            constructive attitude with which Greece had approached the conference,
                            others, “with encouragement from various sources”, had no intention of
                            trying to work out a solution.</p>
                        <p>In this connection Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>
                            said he must take issue with the Ambassador’s interpretation. All of our
                            information indicated that the British had suggested the talks and
                            entered into them in good faith. (The Ambassador obviously refused to
                            accept this.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> added
                            that he believed the conference had not been completely negative; the
                            British proposals represented some progress and he <pb n="287"
                                xml:id="pg_287" facs="0317"/>hoped everyone concerned would give
                            very serious consideration to them.</p>
                        <p>When the conversation turned to the recent unfortunate anti-Greek riots
                            in Istanbul and Izmir, the Ambassador said the fact that demonstrations
                            began simultaneously in widely scattered areas and that “bombs” were set
                            in Greek churches indicated advance planning. He also denied in most
                            vehement terms that the dynamiting of the Turkish Consulate in Salonika
                            was “done by a Greek hand.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said that we were
                            shocked by the outbreak of violence in Turkey. Our views had been made
                            known to the Turkish Government, and at the same time we had urged that
                            they do everything in their power to prevent worsening of their
                            relations within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and in the Balkan
                            Alliance. As the Ambassador probably knew, we had informed the Greek
                            Government of our gratification at the steps taken by the Greek
                            Government to prevent retaliatory demonstrations in Greece and to
                            protect Turkish property. However, we were greatly concerned at the
                            growing indications of the revival of old animosities which the Greek
                            Government—and the Ambassador personally—had done so much to suppress.
                            It was understandable that emotions were running high at the present
                            time, but it appeared to us that all of the reasons which had existed in
                            the time of <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> for trying
                            to bring about close Greek-Turk friendship still obtained. Any attempt
                            to assess responsibility for the present situation was irrelevant when
                            larger issues were at stake. The gravity of the situation was
                            unmistakable when the Greek Foreign Minister informed us that, if the
                            Turkish Government refused to accept the revised version of a Note which
                            it rejected in its first form as containing unacceptable aspersions on
                            Turkish officials, the Greek Government would sever diplomatic relations
                            with Turkey. The Greek Ambassador was visibly shaken by this
                            information, which he had not heard from his Foreign Office. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said that, according
                            to a subsequent message, the Greek Cabinet had, for the time being at
                            least, rejected the <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of a break in
                            diplomatic relations, but the fact that such a step was seriously
                            considered and might still be a possibility indicated the degree to
                            which relations had deteriorated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1"
                                >Jernegan</persName> also referred to the Greek announcement that
                            its forces would not participate in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> maneuvers. This would be a great blow to Allied unity,
                            and he hoped the Greek Government could reconsider its decision. To
                            justify the Greek position, the Ambassador pointed out the danger of
                            unfortunate incidents if Greek and Turkish units should participate in
                            joint military exercises at this time.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador left he asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1"
                                >Jernegan</persName> how he felt about the forthcoming <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1"
                                >Jernegan</persName> said he contemplated the prospect of discussion
                            on the Cyprus question with <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0318"
                            />consternation and fear. He believed further public debate could serve
                            no one’s interests and would only exacerbate feelings now at fever
                            pitch. He would hope that the question could be discussed in some other
                            forum than that of the General Assembly. It was noteworthy that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName>, though not agreeing to
                            this suggestion, did not immediately state that his Government could
                            under no circumstances agree to keeping Cyprus off the <gloss

                                indicated that he had followed the “deterioration” of Greek-Turkish
                                relations over the Cyprus issue with “concern” and noted that

                                The Secretary added that over the past decade Greece and Turkey had
                                cooperated to deter “Communist ambitions” in the eastern
                                Mediterranean and noted that he found it difficult to believe that

                                of the past several weeks. <persName>Dulles</persName> reminded the

                                bulwark and urged the Prime Minister to make sure that the
                                “effectiveness” of the Greek-Turkish partnership was not ruined by
                                present conflicts. An identical message was also sent to the Turkish
                                Prime Minister. Telegram 823 also transmitted the text of a
                                statement that the Department planned to release to the press on
                                September 18. It indicated that the Department had expressed “deep
                                concern” over the violence in Istanbul and Izmir and noted that the

                            recently, this plea for public voicing US views on events is coupled

                        <p>I expect you will have had a full report on the Tripartite Conference on
                            Cyprus from your people here, with whom we have been in close touch. I
                            deeply regret that we were not able to persuade the Greeks and the Turks
                            to accept our proposals for a settlement, but I still hope that with
                            time they will come round to accepting them as at least a basis for
                            further discussion. In our desire to find a way out of this most
                            unfortunate and dangerous dispute, we took an unprecedented step in
                            agreeing to discuss with two foreign governments the internal affairs of
                            an indisputably British territory. We also invited them to join with us
                            in working out a system of self-government. This offer remains open. We
                            are very grateful for the support which our efforts received through
                            your Embassies in London, Athens and Ankara. Meanwhile, although we
                            still await the official reply from Athens, the indications are that the
                            Greek Government are determined to reject our proposals and to go ahead
                            once more with their appeal to the United Nations. I am convinced that
                            it could only make matters worse if the Greeks succeeded in getting the
                            matter debated again in the United Nations. There is no hope that this
                            would lead to a solution, while it is certain that the discussion would
                            further inflame Greco-Turkish relations and increase the strain upon
                            their co-operation in the North Atlantic alliance. It would certainly
                            encourage further disorder and terrorism in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if the Cyprus item can be kept off the General
                            Assembly’s agenda, there would be a chance for passions to cool, and
                            progress to be resumed. For our part, we will continue to make it clear
                            that the British proposals still stand; that we are prepared to consider
                            amendments or counter-proposals; and that we intend to resume
                            negotiations with the other two Governments as soon as conditions
                            allow.</p>
                        <p>For these practical reasons and not simply because of Article 2(VII) of
                            the Charter, we are bound to oppose the Greeks on the inscription of the
                            item. I very much hope that you will take the same view. It is likely
                            that the attitude of the United States Delegation towards inscription
                            will be decisive. This dispute with <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293"
                                facs="0323"/>Greece is a great sorrow to us in this country, who
                            have such a long tradition of friendship with the Greek people. But we
                            cannot lose sight of the fact that it is the internal exigencies of
                            Greek politics which have inflamed the situation in and about Cyprus and
                            that the trouble will go on so long as the Greeks continue to foment it.
                            The only thing which will make them pause is a clear rebuff by a good
                            majority at the United Nations. We assume that you will support us in
                            any case on the substance of the question as you did last year. But in
                            view of the really grave consequences which could so easily follow from
                            debating Cyprus in the United Nations at the present time, when passions
                            are running high, I do most sincerely hope that you will use your great
                            influence to prevent the item from securing inscription.</p>

                                <p>It would be contrary to our general policy to oppose inscription.
                                    Indeed, I do not now recall that we have ever done so. We are
                                    also deeply concerned as to repercussions in Greece and on Greek

                            <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName>’s statement before the
                            General Committee will be along the following lines.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations themselves decided that it was inappropriate to
                            discuss this question last year. It is even more so now. It seems to us
                            clear that public debate of this most difficult problem can only make
                            matters worse. The best hope of reconciling the conflicting views of the
                            three Governments primarily concerned and of promoting a settlement must
                            be through diplomacy and confidential talks. It was with this conviction
                            that we took the unusual step of calling a conference to deal with a
                            matter of strictly British jurisdiction. After the first days had
                            revealed the different positions we put before the conference
                            constructive proposals which made the most of the considerable area of
                            common ground.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> will explain these
                            proposals. You will have seen them but I would like to draw your
                            attention particularly to the following points which we will emphasise: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>The constitution is to be a liberal one designed very
                                    sincerely to lead to the fullest measure of internal
                                    self-government compatible with the strategic requirements of
                                    the present international situation.</item>
                                <label>(b)</label>
                                <item>There would be from the outset an Assembly with an elected
                                    majority. All departments of the Cyprus Government would be
                                    progressively transferred to Cypriot Ministers responsible to
                                    the Assembly, with the sole exception of foreign affairs,
                                    defence and <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0325"/>public
                                    security. These must be reserved since the Cypriots could not
                                    alone sustain these responsibilities. But otherwise it is
                                    certainly our intention to make as rapid progress as conditions
                                    allow.</item>
                                <label>(c)</label>
                                <item>A Cypriot Chief Minister would head the new Cypriot
                                    administration.</item>
                                <label>(d)</label>
                                <item>Since it is only too clear that constitutional progress in
                                    Cyprus depends upon the cooperation of [or] at least the tacit
                                    assent of the Greek and Turkish Governments, we proposed a
                                    tripartite committee with the following tasks:— <list>

                                        <item>To examine the detailed proposals to be drawn up by

                        <p>Our statement will not deny that the first results of the conference were
                            disappointing. But although formal tripartite discussions seem difficult
                            to arrange at this moment, Her Majesty’s Government are determined to
                            persevere with friendly and informal consultation. The conference is
                            suspended not ended. Our proposals stand, and we are prepared to
                            consider amendments or counter proposals at any time.</p>
                        <p>Finally we proposed that when self-government was in working order the
                            full conference should meet again with the advantage of the presence of
                            representative Cypriots to discuss the whole position.</p>
                        <p>All these proposals taken together seem to us a fair and generous basis
                            for advance. We feel therefore that discussion at the United Nations can
                            only hinder and not help. The situation is extremely delicate. The
                            relations between friends and allies are strained; if irreparable damage
                            is not to be done, tempers must be given time to cool.</p>
                        <p>So much for what <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> will
                            say. He will also have my speech at the conference on September 6 to
                            guide him. Since events have shown that the success of self-government
                            in Cyprus largely depends on the attitude of the Greeks and the Turks it
                            would surely be unwise to go into any further detail especially on such
                            questions as the protection of minorities which will require very
                            delicate negotiation. The Turks believe that our proposals go too far
                            and are premature. Any attempt to go further would meet the sharpest
                            reaction in that quarter.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>I know that you do not see eye to eye with us on the principle of
                            opposing the inscription of items of this kind on the agenda of the
                            United Nations. But I do feel that by any standard the case against the
                            inscription of the Cyprus item is overwhelming. We have just received
                            the Greek reply to our London proposals. It is a tendentious document,
                            which chooses to misinterpret our proposals by underrating the
                            constitutional offer and alleging that the tripartite committee is
                            designed to impede rather than promote self-government. The reply refers
                            specifically to the Greek “success” in getting the Cyprus item inscribed
                            on the agenda of the United Nations last year. This, I think, proves how
                            much last year’s inscription of the item has had to do with the
                            uncompromising attitude which the Greeks have adopted since. If the
                            Greeks get the same encouragement this year it can only make them more
                            intransigent and, conversely, make the Turks even more rigid. That is
                            why I feel so strongly that it is in the interest of all of us to keep
                            the item off the agenda.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that I am as unhappy as you are about the effect of this
                            Cyprus dispute on Greece’s relations with N.A.T.O. As regards the
                            internal situation in Greece I think it suffers partly from there being
                            no effective Prime Minister and partly from the shock caused by the
                            tragic events in Istanbul and Smyrna. I do not think that discussion at
                            the United Nations is going to help on either of these points. I must
                            say frankly that I do not see what more we can do to make things better
                            as long as the Greek Government reject our proposals for self-government
                            unless accompanied by an immediate pledge of self-determination. This
                            ignores the facts of life; including British strategic needs and the
                            Turkish determination not to see the last of their off-shore islands
                            pass into Greek hands. In any case I find it hard to believe that the
                            Greek Government’s ultimate loyalty to N.A.T.O.—from which Greece
                            derives such immense advantages—really depends upon their having their
                            whole way over Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks themselves recognised during the London Conference that we
                            must retain sovereignty in Cyprus in the immediate future. Any
                            resolution by the United Nations, short of an outright rejection of
                            inscription would, however moderate its terms, make our task in Cyprus
                            that much the more difficult. Rioting and terrorism in Cyprus, and the
                            inevitable measures to suppress them must make Anglo-Greek relations
                            still more difficult. The repercussions in Turkey could be equally
                            grave.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the position in Turkey gives no less case for anxiety than the
                            position in Greece. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has just told me of
                            a talk he has had with the Turkish Prime Minister. There is no doubt at
                            all that at the moment Cyprus is the essential issue in <pb n="297"
                                xml:id="pg_297" facs="0327"/>Turkish politics. The Chancellor was
                            deeply impressed by the Prime Minister’s concern over the internal
                            situation in Turkey. I think we ought to give equal importance to the
                            Turkish as to the Greek aspect of this unhappy business.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons I must ask you to use your great influence against
                            the inscription of this item. The present indications are that the vote
                            will be a close one and that the attitude of the United States will
                            probably be decisive. Acting in harmony we could, I believe, prevent
                            further discussion of this vexed problem in an atmosphere which is full
                            of such explosive possibilities.</p>

                        <p>840. In present circumstances, I am convinced General Assembly discussion
                            Cyprus question would lead to intemperate debate and might well cause
                            incidents in Greece and Turkey which would destroy remains of
                            Greek-Turkish cooperation. Importance free world unity and threat to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> far exceeds that of Cyprus
                            question. I have therefore decided we must seek persuade Greece not
                            press for consideration Cyprus item in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            and that we must actively seek prevent inscription if Greeks insist upon
                            pressing consideration Cyprus item this session. In reaching this
                            conclusion I am aware U.S. will be criticized for opposing aspirations
                            dependent people and that SovBloc may take advantage situation. Also
                            realize that for present we will probably lose ability influence Greek
                            Government. However importance maintaining maximum possible free world
                            unity is overriding.</p>
                        <p>I therefore ask you use best efforts persuade Greek Government not press
                            for consideration Cyprus item this session and suggest approach somewhat
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>In U.S. opinion present grave crisis between Greece and Turkey would
                            become even more serious if discussed in <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss>. We believe this might be fatal blow Balkan Pact and
                            cause grave breach <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense which
                            is basis our unity and strength. Also such a public <pb n="298"
                                xml:id="pg_298" facs="0328"/>discussion Cyprus question now would
                            make possibility any solution even more difficult. We convinced that
                            after recent deplorable events best and most statesmanlike course is to
                            let question remain in abeyance for immediate present as far as <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is concerned. We do not feel question
                            should be ignored or forgotten. We are not supporting colonialism or
                            opposing self-determination.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief sincere efforts of parties most concerned to work toward
                            mutually satisfactory solution represents best and perhaps only feasible
                            way of resolving Cyprus problem. This is also within spirit <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, whose members are pledged to employ all
                            possible methods of solving problems among themselves before resorting
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forum. In our considered opinion
                            recent UK proposals represent progress and development self-government
                            for Cypriot people offers best prospect for ultimate solution acceptable
                            to parties concerned and in interests free world unity. We have been
                            assured by UK that, despite inconclusive outcome London talks, UK
                            prepared proceed with sincere and determined efforts give
                            self-government to Cypriot people and UK further prepared give
                            sympathetic consideration to any amendments or counter-proposals to
                            suggestions they made in London. UK position can be interpreted as
                            carrying implication that international status Cyprus need not remain
                            unchanged in perpetuity. We believe Greek Government, which we know
                            desires eventual application principle self-determination to Cyprus,
                            would be well-advised to cooperate now with UK and use its influence
                            with Cypriot people to participate in orderly steps toward
                            self-government. We can further assure Greek Government that U.S. will
                            actively and vigorously use its influence induce and assist UK to move
                            toward this end.</p>
                        <p>We hope Greek leaders will continue show statesmanship by remembering
                            free world unity must be placed ahead problems existing between
                            individual members. Since this our conviction, we ask Greek Government
                            not press for consideration Cyprus this session and must state that in
                            view shortness time we cannot delay making known confidentially to other
                            delegations we intend oppose inscription Cyprus item. We hope Greek
                            Government will quickly decide not press question so that we will not
                            have to come into open opposition and actively oppose inscription. If
                            Greek Government agrees, we will do all in our power assist it to carry
                            out this decision with dignity.</p>
                        <p>There are at least two ways in which Greeks could do this.</p>

                                be as non-controversial as possible and would conclude with
                                statement by Greece of its decision not to press consideration

                            on UNGA Agenda. <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> predicted, in highly
                            emotional reaction, four immediate results following announcement of
                            vote, probably September 22 or 23: (1) Government would undoubtedly
                            fall; (2) he himself would immediately resign; (3) Balkan Alliance would
                            collapse; and (4) serious anti-American riots would break out in
                            Greece.</p>

                            them to take all feasible precautions. You may, at your discretion, also
                            call on Greek authorities to grant every possible protection.</p>

                                <p>“The Secretary telephoned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                        >Allen</persName> to inquire about the status of the cables
                                    to Greece. The Secretary said he was not clear as to whether he
                                    should do anything about them or not. <persName

                                    be a leak.</p>
                                <p>“The Secretary said we would be working on a statement which

                                    the Greeks felt about this situation. The Secretary said he
                                    feared we were committed re inscription. <persName

                                    up for this action. The Secretary agreed, saying what we said in
                                    this connection would have a great deal of significance. They
                                    also discussed the Secretary’s conversation with <persName

                            marshalled all pertinent arguments. After bringing him away from three
                            successive attitudes, none of which was acceptable even to himself, we
                            centered talk on what might be productive under UK assurances backed by
                            US promises of inducement and assistance (paragraph 4 reference
                            telegram). He said this was only possible stand on which Greek
                            Government would dare to face people if inscription position abandoned.
                            He said these assurances as stated in <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss> would be scornfully rejected in present tense
                            atmosphere, and 11th hour pressures in form of promises after recent
                            bitter experiences, would be highly suspect even though personally he,
                            and he thought <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName>, would like to work
                            with US on that basis. Nonetheless he would ask
                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> to explore with Secretary
                            whether more specific and concrete proposals can be obtained as only

                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> recommendations must be debated

                            Reaction to Secretary’s message on Turkish outrages delivered
                                Sunday<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">September 18; see <ref
                                    target="#d129fn3">footnote 3, Document 129</ref>.</note> has
                            been most violent and inscription is now basic issue in both foreign and
                            domestic policy. Canellopoulos said flatly and with no hysterics that
                            with abandonment inscription on no better grounds than presented in
                            reference telegram, government would not last one hour and I believe
                            him. That by itself might be tolerable, but the alienation to [<hi
                                rend="italic">of</hi>] Greece might not be as temporary as assumed
                            in reference telegram. To me this would be great blow to our entire
                            post-war foreign policy which found both concrete and symbolic
                            expression in Greek-American cooperation leading to expulsion of
                            Communist guerrillas from Greece in 1947–1949. Our intervention in
                            Greece in 1947 marked turning point in steady expansionism of Soviet in
                            post-World War II years. As a symbol of US determination to stand firm
                            against Soviet Communist power, Greece is unique.</p>
                        <p>Greece, contiguous with Soviet Eastern European bloc, has many
                            historical, religious and cultural affiliations with countries in that
                            bloc. We can hardly assume that given a deterioration in US-Greek
                            relations, Greece could not by process of peaceful infiltration become
                            either a people’s democracy or a neutralist fellow-travelling state.
                            Greece is already the object of a two-sided though not necessarily
                            coordinated campaign from Belgrade and Moscow. Social and economic
                            conditions here are such as to constitute no real obstacle to the loss
                            of Greece to the Communist bloc if we allow our own influence to be
                            destroyed by an insensitive unrealistic policy.</p>
                        <p>The fall of the present government at this time would open field to
                            leftist and anti-US elements. The more moderate and pro-US political
                            leaders who might under other circumstances form a new government would
                            be completely discredited and silenced. In short, in opposing Greek
                            request for inscription, we take great risk of setting in motion forces
                            which will seriously threaten entire system of security in this part of
                            world without active cooperation of Greece is beyond our comprehension.
                            Spectacle of US abandoning Greece will have worldwide repercussions.</p>
                        <p>While question of US position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            generally falls outside purview of US-Greek relations, we cannot help
                            wondering whether taking a position that question which demonstrably is
                            disturbing international peace and security should not be discussed
                            would at some future time come to haunt us in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> deliberations. For example <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                                facs="0333"/>since a year and a half our protestations that we are
                            not opposing self-determination have met only cynical response. Is it
                            not in our interest to maintain the principle in connection with captive
                            nations now under Soviet control on a question which we might one day
                            wish to press within <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework?</p>
                        <p>We are equally concerned with possibility that despite efforts of US to
                            prevent inscription of Cyprus issue on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            agenda, question might nevertheless be inscribed by virtue of support
                            that Greece may receive from Afro-Asian, Soviet and Latin Americans.
                            Canellopoulos mentioned this and, as for himself, rejected with disgust
                            the thought that Greece could so be separated from her allies on whom
                            her future welfare as well as her moral standing in world depend. A
                            successor government may well decide differently. If in present strained
                            situation Greeks find they can achieve success for their national effort
                            through support from those countries against opposition of their <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, it is not difficult to
                            conjecture where Opportunistic foreign policy might lead them.</p>

                            inscribe the Cyprus question. Both the United States and the United

                                    on the Cyprus matter. He said that he had sent me a written
                                    message, but he wanted to reinforce it personally. I said that
                                    it had been a difficult decision to take, but having taken it,
                                    we went through with it in helping to get the votes necessary to
                                    succeed. Otherwise, the British would have been defeated.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he was
                                    well aware of that fact. He went on to say he was determined to
                                    carry the thing through to a successful conclusion, and would
                                    make some constructive proposals in the very near future.”

                            in seeking to work towards a solution of the problem in consultation
                            with the Turkish and Greek Governments, but I fear that neither of them
                            are likely to agree on any steps towards self-government in the near
                            future. Such steps would be too much for Turkey and not enough for
                            Greece. Therefore I am glad to have heard from you that the United
                            Kingdom will soon decide on its own initiative to take some steps
                            towards self-government. Also, I recall the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>–Churchill Declaration of June 29, 1954 that
                            they would “earnestly strive by every peaceful means to secure the
                            independence of all countries whose peoples desire and are capable of
                            sustaining an independent existence. We welcome the processes of
                            development, where still needed, that lead toward that goal.”<note n="4"

                        <p>I have written frankly, believing that this is the best basis for working
                            out mutually satisfactory positions on this matter. I need not emphasize
                            the traditional and popular feelings in the United States on colonial
                            questions. I sincerely hope that we shall both find the means to
                            continue our cooperation on the Cyprus question.</p>

                                >Foster</persName></hi>: It was good of you to let me have, in your
                            letter of October 5,<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2"><ref target="#d141"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra.</hi></ref></note> your thoughts on
                            Cyprus. I agree entirely with you that the Cyprus situation remains a
                            cause of concern both in the island itself and because of its effects
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The rejection by the Greek and Turkish Governments, for opposite reasons,
                            of our proposals for self-government in Cyprus is bound to remain a
                            cause of real difficulty. There are perhaps grounds for hope that the
                            new Greek Government may be less uncompromising than its predecessor.
                            But there remains the Turkish objection to any form of self-government
                            until the Greek demand for self-determination has been withdrawn. This
                            is a formidable obstacle.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless we have every intention of doing whatever is possible to
                            break the deadlock in Cyprus. The new Governor has lost no time in
                            consulting the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities. He has also
                            explained the meaning of the British proposals in a broadcast of which I
                            enclose a copy.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">The text of the broadcast by
                                Field Marshal Sir <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">John
                                    Harding</persName>, appointed September 25 as Governor of
                                Cyprus, is not printed.</note> I commend to your attention
                            especially the concluding passages of this broadcast, in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> makes it clear that we are
                            closing no doors.</p>
                        <p>To our regret (and perhaps also to his own) Archbishop Makarios has told
                            the Governor that he cannot accept our formula as satisfactory. This is
                            unfortunate, the more so as there is some reason to believe that the
                            Archbishop personally may now be willing to consider some compromise
                            solution. But so long as the extremists are dominant and men of goodwill
                            are intimidated, it is hard for the leaders to be conciliatory. Thus our
                            first task in Cyprus is to restore conditions of security and order in
                            which reason and conciliation can gain a foothold.</p>
                        <p>However, the new Greek Foreign Minister<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">On

                            without hope that the talks with the Archbishop may be resumed.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile we are working on the details of the constitutional
                            arrangements which I outlined at the London Conference last month. Just
                            when these will be published must partly depend on circumstances,
                            including political developments in Cyprus and any changes in the
                            attitudes of Greece and Turkey. But, despite the obstacles, it is our
                            firm intention to press forward, and in this I know we can count on your
                            continued understanding and support.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Greek Foreign Minister opened the conversation by asking the
                            Secretary whether he felt confident about the success of the coming
                            discussions in Geneva. The Secretary said that he thought there was
                            about an even chance that some good might come out of them although he
                            was not encouraged by the recent course of action of the Soviets in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that he wished
                            to speak about a few developments concerning Greece and that he
                            regretted things were not as good as they could be. Public opinion in
                            Greece had been extremely disturbed since the unfortunate outbreak in
                            Turkey a month ago and, with the prospect of new elections in Greece,
                            the <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0338"/>Communists were exploiting
                            the situation. The Communist Party in Greece is a strong one and used
                            with skill from Moscow. The government is anxious to reestablish the
                            situation as nearly as possible as it was before last month. To do this
                            it needs help, both moral and material. On the first score, the Greek
                            Government appreciates the help which the U.S. furnished in convincing
                            the Turks to take the various steps which they did. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> remarked that unfortunately a number of
                            things which we said in voicing our repugnance at the things done by the
                            Turks were never adequately reported by the Greeks; for example, the
                            letter which the Secretary sent to Senator <persName corresp="#p_CHE1"
                                >Capehart</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">Not found in
                                Department of State files.</note> and statements made in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Greek press portrayed the U.S. as
                            indifferent and as equating the victim and the wrongdoer. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that the press in Greece
                            is not subject to government discipline and that the things which the
                            Secretary mentioned did not reflect the spirit of the government. In
                            reply to the Secretary’s statement that there was undoubtedly a strong
                            tendency on the part of the Greek people to feel deserted, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that the Greeks are a
                            sentimental people; sometimes this sentimentality is an obstacle and
                            sometimes an advantage. It is up to us now to exploit it to our
                            advantage and it must be made clear to the Greek people that the moral
                            part of the situation has been set straight. The Secretary commented
                            that the ceremony that day at Izmir<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">On

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> then referred to the
                            present financial difficulties of the Greek Government. He said he
                            understood that the Turks have asked for aid. The Secretary commented
                            that they have been asking for aid for some time but that we had not
                            been persuaded it was necessary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> said he did not wish to imply that it might
                            not be necessary but that any action to assist the Turks should be
                            considered in the light of the Greek financial problem. The Secretary
                            said he could give Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName>
                            assurance that the United States will do nothing precipitate and that we
                            will do nothing in this respect without relation to Greek sensibilities.
                            He said a telegram would be sent immediately to the Department informing
                            it of this assurance.<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">Transmitted in <gloss

                                corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that because of the
                            relationship of the Greek financial picture to Greece’s responsibilities
                            in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> organization, he had
                            informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1">Perkins</persName> that
                            unless Greece received financial help it would have <pb n="309"

                            economic index figure, balancing its budget and supporting its currency.
                            He said that he had taken up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1"
                                >Perkins</persName> the consideration of offshore procurement of
                            munitions in Greece which is an important item in Greek manufacturing.
                            He said he had also presented the full picture to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCW1">Cannon</persName>. He expressed the hope that the
                            Secretary would consider the problem as urgently as possible, since
                            delay would create a situation that would affect the Greek elections
                            next year. He commented that the Greeks know Communists from several
                            years of guerilla warfare and that it was clear that the next election
                            would be fought on the question of international relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that the last
                            matter he wished to raise was Greek relations with the British. He
                            commented that the gap between the British and the Archbishop of Cyprus
                            is deep but not very wide and that he was seeing Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> tomorrow. The
                            Secretary said that he felt the Cyprus situation had gone sour because
                            the Greek Government had pushed it too hard and fast and because the
                            British had moved too slowly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> said he was asking the U.S. to help in getting

                                >Harding</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"

                                appointed Governor of Cyprus to replace Sir Robert Armitage. Early
                                in October, <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> arrived
                                in Cyprus and had a series of discussions with <persName

                                they had been unable to reach agreement.</note> Such negotiations
                            are the best way to proceed. If the meeting is handled from Greece it
                            makes the Cypriot nationalists traitors. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> said that while the negotiations were going on
                            the Greek Government might hold discussions with the British behind the
                            scenes. He said he might later ask the Secretary to intervene to give
                            the negotiations a final push. The Secretary said he would try to honor
                            any reasonable request of that nature. We had said in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that such negotiations were the best way
                            to handle the problem. He could not, however, guarantee that he would
                            act because he did not know what the exact nature of the request might
                            be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that it was
                            important to get the Cyprus question settled because the Communists were
                            using it as they always did the colonial issue. The Secretary agreed
                            that it was the type of thing the Communists were eager to exploit. In
                            the U.S. our sentiments are almost always on the side of colonial
                            peoples, although sometimes we have to keep our sentiments under control
                            as we also have ties with colonial powers. It is important to find
                            peaceful solutions to colonial issues. If they break out into violence
                            the Communists know how to use that. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> said it was important for <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to understand that the Greek
                            Government has its public pressures just as <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> has <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0340"
                            />his. The Secretary said critics of the present British Government were
                            attacking it for giving up the Suez base and pointing out that no sooner
                            had the base been taken over by Egypt than the Communists had moved in.
                            Similarly, with respect to Cyprus, it is important to make sure that it
                            did not pass under Communist control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said that he expected
                            that he would be queried by the press about his conference with the
                            Secretary and that he intended to say that this was the first
                            opportunity he had had to meet the Secretary and that they had discussed
                            a broad range of matters, including the forthcoming conference in
                            Geneva.</p>

                            aim at elections within next year or so, which might show strong
                            Communist vote. This might help sober Moderates. While British want
                            agreement with Greeks they must be careful to handle in way not to

                                    >Aldrich</persName>, the Greek Ambassador found this a

                        <p>Cyprus question is becoming central national issue of Greek electorate in
                            approaching elections. Whatever may have been true in earlier years, I
                            am convinced Cyprus question is genuine political and national problem
                            of paramount importance in both Greek internal and external policy. We
                            have done our best to warn Greek authorities of danger to Greece of
                            permitting Cyprus question to become touchstone of their relations with
                            outside world and particularly of their relations with US, which are of
                            such tangible benefit to Greece in economic and military spheres. Leader
                            of present government is fully aware of this danger but is perhaps at
                            moment even more keenly sensitive to deep-seated sentiments of
                            electorate on which he will depend so soon for his political
                            future.…</p>
                        <p>Because of this situation it is of utmost importance that we be as
                            clear-headed as possible as to fundamentals of our position on Cyprus
                            question and that we not be tempted to take positions either
                            diplomatically or publicly which we may later have to modify or abandon.
                            While present Greek bitterness and resentment over our position on
                            Cyprus is largely irrational and unjustified, they do have some grounds
                            in reproaching us for, as they see it, our strong pressure in inducing
                            them take part in London tripartite talks since they reason that we
                            should not have done so unless we had sufficient assurances re British
                            and Turk intentions to make sure conference would not be the unmitigated
                            failure they felt it to have been.</p>
                        <p>As a case in point I would refer to <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"

                            endeavor to persuade Greeks not put Cyprus on UNGA agenda, authorized me
                            to assure Greek Government that “US will actively and vigorously use its
                            influence induce and assist UK to move toward” self-government. I did so
                            inform Greek Government. In US “talking paper” handed to the Greek
                            Foreign Minister at about same time in New York,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d145fn4">Not found.</note> the US merely pledged itself “to
                            continue to interest itself in the Cyprus situation”. Similarly
                            restrained language was used by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1"
                                >Lodge</persName> in his public presentation before UNGA general
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>That we shall continue to interest ourselves in Cyprus question is
                            obvious. If, however, we intend to adopt an active and vigorous policy,
                            that is another matter. These differentiations are not lost upon
                            Greeks.</p>

                        <p>The same talking paper refers to deep embarrassment of Turkish Government
                            over anti-Greek riots and its disposition seek amends, and accepts this
                            assertion as an argument in favor of Greece’s pursuing quiet policy on
                            Cyprus. Turkish Government has recently made it known that its position
                            on Cyprus remains unchanged. We have also noted that in <persName

                            self-government until Greek demands or self-determination withdrawn is
                            described as “a formidable obstacle”. If Turkish position remains as
                            stated and is accepted by British as virtual veto, there would appear to
                            be little point in encouraging Greeks to believe that a solution is in
                            sight. Moreover fact that British Government persists in belief that it
                            is “internal exigencies of Greek politics which have inflamed situation
                            in and about Cyprus and that trouble will go on so long as Greeks
                            continue to foment it” (<persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName>’s recent message to Secretary) shows that British

                        <p>Unless we have intention and capability of giving Greece effective
                            support on Cyprus issue within the limits of a formula including early
                            self-government plus some assurance for an evolution which could lead to
                            self-determination, we should refrain from risky course of holding out
                            hopes which British and Turks can frustrate.</p>

                                the people of Cyprus, within the framework of the treaties and

                                >Theotokis</persName>. There was little need to dwell on favorable
                            features latest British formula since Prime Minister and Foreign
                            Minister share our belief that it represents real step forward.
                            Uppermost in their minds now was the problem facing them as result of
                            rejection of the British proposal by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> about which they had heard from <persName

                                >Makarios</persName> attitude would be exploited to jeopardize their

                            British formula represented progress but that this would have to be
                            qualified by expression to effect that decision in matter up to Cypriot

                                >Theotokis</persName> inquired whether it would be possible to bring

                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He thought this could take
                            both public and private forms. He seemed to have in mind that whatever
                            was said by the US Government publicly on latest British formula should
                            be devised with eye to possible impact on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and his followers in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Re “private approach” he wondered whether appropriate American official
                            might not be able to convey to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> a warning that Cyprus case could hardly expect

                            such forward move by British should be rejected so summarily. Asked
                            whether he thought any American advice would be effective with <persName

                                >Theotokis</persName> recalled that he and <persName

                            possibility that at some difficult stage in negotiations American
                            assistance might be required, and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had agreed that this might be beneficial.</p>

                        <p>While I made it clear to <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName>
                            that course he was suggesting was untried and would require careful
                            weighing of implications, and I therefore gave him no encouragement,
                            there may in fact be some merit in such intercession with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> at appropriate time, perhaps
                            through some suitable unofficial American having background which would

                            Secretary December 15, <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                            said that Greek Government had been weak and timid in recent discussions
                            on Cyprus and he hoped Secretary would tell <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> that point had been reached where necessary
                            for them to agree on something and not keep discussions going forever.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> should be urged to
                            tell Archbishop to see <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>
                            and move on toward agreement. Secretary said his reports indicated there
                            had been encouraging progress and he hoped UK as well as Greeks would
                            continue to bear in mind essentiality of early agreement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary saw Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> this morning. Latter said British proposals
                            put in such a way as to be practically unintelligible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had stated UK position in
                            satisfactory form in House of Commons debate. Formula should be couched
                            in such a way as to be understandable by public. Principal objections
                            were to double negative in first paragraph, dependence of future action
                            toward self-determination upon views of other countries in area and
                            absence of specific length of time at end of which decision would be
                            made re self-determination.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he could not get into middle of question of drafting. That
                            was for Greece and UK to work out. He felt that double negative was
                            awkward but that rest was not too bad. He said present draft represents
                            tremendous advance in substance from which Greek Government could take
                            great satisfaction. It had achieved substance of victory and should not
                            risk losing it by striving for too much perfection in wording. Extremely
                            important get matter settled quickly.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed with
                            Secretary to eliminate double negative.</p>

                            that negotiations be resumed at this time. The Prime Minister replied
                            very curtly that he did not think so at all. Had the British formula
                            been a good one, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would
                            have already resumed negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1"
                                >Thurston</persName> reminded the Prime Minister that the revised
                            formula was a distinct improvement over anything that had been offered
                            by the British so far, since it assured self-government at once and
                            self-determination in the future. The Prime Minister remarked that he
                            had no means of bringing pressure upon or even influencing <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to resume negotiations. He
                            wished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> to understand
                            that this was not a case for his Government to decide upon. Had it been
                            so, everything would be much simpler. He would have been able to take
                            decisions himself and on the spot. He pointed out to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>, should the Archbishop turn
                            down any such recommendation, that would automatically blow up his
                            Government. He went on to say, … that nothing would have pleased him
                            more than the resumption of discussions between <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>, but that as things stand at
                            present there is nothing he can do to influence <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He, the Prime Minister, … is
                            forced to work for almost 22 hours out of every 24, and 6 to 8 hours a
                            day are devoted to Cyprus. He cannot possibly continue in this way, and

                            elections. He referred to the difficulties in communicating with

                            exasperating factor.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> said he
                            would venture to quote certain excerpts from a report concerning a
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            during the first week of December.<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4"
                                >Presumably a reference to the conversation reported on in <ref
                                    target="#d150">Document 150</ref>.</note> This Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> did in confidence and added
                            that the source was a reliable one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1"
                                >Thurston</persName> stated that according to this report, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> unquestionably wished to
                            reach an agreement soon with the British and was ready to try to obtain
                            it by further negotiations of the present British offer. Furthermore,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was reported as
                            being on this occasion more confident that he could control the
                            extremists and get support for a negotiated settlement. In this
                            connection he was not disturbed by the prospect that the Greek
                            Government would seek continuance of negotiations. It would appear, said
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>, from what <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had said in the course of
                            this conversation, that the Archbishop might be prepared to resume his
                            talks at this time, particularly after the clarifications made by the
                            British in their revised formula. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1"
                                >Thurston</persName> laid some emphasis on that part of the
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in
                            which the Archbishop had said that he had great esteem for the personal
                            integrity of Governor <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>.
                            It could be, added Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> is the man with
                            whom <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would prefer to
                            pursue his negotiations. If that were the case, the Prime Minister
                            asked, why had <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> not
                            already done so? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName>
                            remarked that—perhaps the Archbishop has felt all this time that
                            something is happening and has purposely postponed the resumption of
                            talks—or, it could well be that he is just waiting for a word of
                            encouragement from the Greek Government.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed great interest in this estimate of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>’ attitude .… He said that he
                            had asked the Foreign Minister this morning to look into the possibility
                            of resuming negotiations with the British on the basis of their revised
                            formula and of his own memorandum of December 5.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d152fn5">The text of the British memorandum was transmitted
                                in despatch 542 from Athens, December 6. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 747C.00/12–655)</note> He added that he would ask Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> to get in touch with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was greatly concerned over the new rise
                            of anti-American feeling amongst the people in the course of the last
                            two or three days. This, he thought, was a most aggravating symptom,
                            particularly after the very great effort he had made personally to calm
                            public opinion during the last two months. He asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> very earnestly to realize that
                            it is of the <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0354"/>utmost importance
                            that the Greek people should always believe that the U.S. are at their
                            side .… It is of the greatest importance not for himself or for the sake
                            of his Government, but for Greece as a whole, as well as for Turkey and
                            for the Balkan Pact. It is the only way for Greece to remain faithful to
                            her alliances. What Greece needs at present is a little “patting on the
                            back”. With the feeling of bitterness and hatred which exists toward the
                            British, the Turks, the French, and others, nothing will stop the people
                            from turning toward Russia if they should be led to believe that the
                            U.S. no longer stands at their side. The Prime Minister had just asked
                            the Foreign Minister to make a public statement denying the reports
                            which had appeared in the press of the last two days in connection with
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> talks in Paris, with a view to
                            dispelling the fears and doubts which had again begun to seize the
                                people.<note n="6" xml:id="d152fn6">Not printed.</note> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> remarked that surely
                            the Prime Minister remembers the assurances given on numerous occasions
                            of the sympathy with which the U.S. Government views the Cyprus issue,
                            as well as the belief that time is working on Greece’s side, while at
                            the same time his Government reserves for itself the right to use its
                            own judgement as to the advisability of this or that policy or method
                            followed by Greece. He assured the Prime Minister that the U.S.
                            Government will continue to use its influence in all directions with a
                            view to bringing about a relief of tension and an ultimate satisfactory
                            settlement for all parties concerned. Proof of the continued interest of
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> himself is that even after his meeting
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> and with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, the Secretary again
                            used his influence with the result that an improvement is in prospect
                            with regard to the wording of the first paragraph of the revised British
                            formula.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he would soon send an envoy to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. At the same time, he asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> for his Government’s
                            assistance in convincing the British to resume negotiations on the basis
                            of their revised formula and of his recent memorandum. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> made an appeal to the Prime
                            Minister for the resumption of negotiations at this time. The Christmas
                            holidays are approaching, he said, and the Western world is in bad need
                            of some good news, particularly in the light of recent Soviet moves. His
                            Government feels that this is a historic opportunity which should not be
                            lost. If allowed to drag on, there is no way of knowing what the present
                            situation may lead to. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1"
                                >Harding</persName> may be forced to take still further measures,
                            and bombs now exploding in Constitution Square are certainly not going
                            to help matters for any one of the parties concerned. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> asked the Prime Minister how
                                <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0355"/>the Greek Government could
                            now assume the grave responsibility of refraining from encouraging
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to resume
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister referred to the deterioration in Greece’s relations
                            with Turkey. The statements recently made in Ankara had been very badly
                            received by the people (he was obviously referring to the recent
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>–Inonu debate in the
                            Turkish Chamber). He was concerned about the disclosures made by the
                            judiciary of Salonika with regard to the explosion in the Turkish
                            Consulate. Unfortunately, he said, the judiciary had rendered their
                            decision. …</p>
                        <p>Just as the Chargé d’Affaires was taking his leave, the Prime Minister
                            remarked very casually that he did not think a solution would be found
                            for the Cyprus issue until after elections. He asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> if he agreed with him. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRL1">Thurston</persName> replied that he
                            believed that the sooner negotiations were resumed and a solution found,
                            the better it would be for all concerned. The Prime Minister did not
                            seem to think that would be possible. Anyway, he said, it would not be
                            long before elections are held. He had almost made up his mind either to
                            have an election or to resign in a fortnight or so. He went on to say
                            that he liked to get things done and that he could not put up with the
                            present state of affairs much longer. Everything was at a standstill, he
                            said. In the course of the next fifteen days he would either decide on
                            elections or he would resign.</p>

                        <p>1785. I am seriously disturbed at reluctance Greek Government to accept
                            what seems to me a substantial victory for Greece in Cyprus problem. I
                            believe modified UK formula represents such a victory and will lead
                            inevitably to self-determination for people of Cyprus. Differences
                            between UK and Greek positions are too small to permit continuation of
                            dispute which may jeopardize long-term <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"
                                facs="0356"/>interests of Greece and endanger vitally essential,
                            free-world alliances.</p>
                        <p>I have done my best to urge UK to bring its policy more in line with
                            Greek and Cypriot desires and I believe my efforts have borne fruit.
                            However it will be difficult for me continue to argue Greek case with
                            conviction if Greek Government is unable accept a formula which concedes
                            the application of eventual self-determination or if Greek Government
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> insist on definite
                            time schedule.</p>
                        <p>Cannot Greek Government take position that in getting UK to offer such a
                            formula it has won recognition of principle of self-determination for
                            Cypriot people? I fear Greeks would really lose many of their friends if
                            it became known they refused a British formula which would generally be
                            interpreted as reasonable.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore this may be high tide for Greece on Cyprus problem and if
                            Greek Government does not try to ride into harbor now, it may find no
                            such favorable opportunity for some years to come. Present British
                            Government and future ones might not be willing make such a good offer
                            as now stands. Certainly a worsening of situation on Cyprus will make
                            concessions by either side more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Unless you perceive objections I should like you to express orally and in
                            your own words to Prime Minister and Foreign Minister such foregoing
                            views as you deem appropriate.</p>
                        <p>If in your considered opinion approach along foregoing lines would be
                            futile or counterproductive I would like your recommendations as to
                            alternate courses of action. Do you think <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> genuinely desires solution now or prefers

                            reported to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, who sat

                                >Theotokis</persName> had made three objections: (1) the double

                            the vagueness of the timing.</p>
                        <p><persName>Harold</persName> told me that they could change the double
                            negative, that there was no basis for inferring a Turkey veto power and
                            that timing could not be made definite.<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">See

                        <p>Thereupon immediately following Council meeting I talked with <persName

                            Greek acceptance of the formula with the double negative eliminated.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> said they <pb

                            impression that <persName>Harold</persName> knew I would report to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName>, as above, and
                            desired me to do so, although of course all of this took place in
                            somewhat hurried and very informal atmosphere and it is possible a
                            misunderstanding may have occurred. In any case I continue to believe
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> should give serious and urgent
                            consideration to alternate phraseology which, in my view, would not
                            alter substance of formula. I suggest that this controversial sentence
                            in formula could be redrafted and if necessary lengthened so that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s offer to meet wishes of Cypriots
                            could be set forth more positively and more clearly; having in mind that
                            it will one day become public. Frankly, I understand that Greek
                            Government is somewhat suspicious of present wording. Finally, in event
                            question again comes before <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I believe
                            such change would improve <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s

                            In Department view revised formula represents fair offer and in U.S.
                            interest to continue work for understanding based on it, despite risk

                            Department has had extensive discussions with <gloss target="#t_HMG1"

                            Such an understanding resulting in decrease in bloodshed and opening way
                            to eventual self-determination would do him great credit as churchman

                            Secretary (January 9 meeting is Attachment B; January 13 meeting is
                            Attachment C<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">Neither printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> summarized these two
                            meetings briefly by saying that at the first one Sir
                                <persName>John</persName> and the Archbishop had had a go at a
                            formula, and that the Archbishop had raised three points which <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had taken into account in revising the
                            formula discussed at the January 9 meeting. At the second meeting on
                            January 13, the revised formula (Attachment D) had been given to the
                            Archbishop, but Sir <persName>John</persName> had reported that this
                            meeting was profoundly unsatisfactory <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333"
                                facs="0363"/>The Secretary inquired whether the three points raised
                            at the January 9 meeting by the Archbishop were the same three points
                            which had been raised with him by the Greek Foreign Minister in Paris
                            (i.e., the double negative; Turkish veto; and vagueness of the phrase on
                            timing). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> said
                            the Archbishop had not raised the double negative and that the points
                            mentioned at the January 9 meeting were different from those which the
                            Greek Foreign Minister had raised with the Secretary in Paris. All this,
                            he said, was clear in the report of that meeting which he had given the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> then said he wished to
                            sum up Field Marshal <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>’s
                            conclusions as follows: <list>

                                <item>Sir <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">John Harding</persName> is
                                    convinced that the Archbishop will not accept any formula which

                                <item>Sir <persName>John</persName> is also convinced that if the
                                    formula given the Archbishop on January 13 is amended, the
                                    Archbishop will raise further objections. In other words, if the
                                    British amend the formula further, and risk a violent adverse
                                    objection by Ankara, the Archbishop will simply raise further
                                    objections and will not accept a reasonable formula;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Sir <persName>John</persName> is profoundly dissatisfied with
                                    the Archbishop’s attitude regarding the use of violence and
                                    terrorism, and is convinced that the Archbishop will not give up
                                    terrorism as one of his negotiating weapons;</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Sir <persName>John</persName> recommends that <gloss
                                        target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> stand pat on the formula put to
                                    the Archbishop on January 13, and instruct him to make it as the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>On this basis, London instructed Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1"
                                >Roger</persName> to approach the Secretary and to stress the
                            Archbishop’s attitude on terrorism. The British Government is not asking
                            the US Government to take any new position. It is grateful for the
                            instructions which have already been sent to Consul <persName

                            is in touch with Consul <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Courtney</persName>
                            and has said that if <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Courtney</persName>
                            could intervene and could see the Archbishop just before <persName
                                corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>’s final meeting with him to
                            put the January 13 formula as the final UK offer, it would be very
                            helpful. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> stressed that
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> was not suggesting that the US
                            Government take a new position, but that it authorize and instruct
                            Consul <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Courtney</persName> to see the
                            Archbishop again just before Sir <persName>John</persName> makes his
                            final offer on the basis of his present US instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName>’s
                            view as to what extent the Archbishop is operating on his own and to
                            what extent is he working with the Greek Government. Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> replied that he could not answer
                            this precisely. The Archbishop had his own council. He <pb n="334"
                                xml:id="pg_334" facs="0364"/>believed that the Greek Government was
                            not prepared to put pressure on the Archbishop to go further than the
                            latter was willing to go. In other words, in this matter the Archbishop
                            was the tail wagging the Greek dog. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1"
                                >Roger</persName> added that the UK Ambassador in Athens had been
                            instructed to give the Greek Government a full account of Sir
                                <persName>John</persName>’s meetings with the Archbishop on January
                            9 and 13.</p>
                        <p>He also said that the UK Government agreed with Sir
                                <persName>John</persName> that they were getting to the end of the
                            discussions with the Archbishop. UK public opinion would not understand
                            why talks were going on when terrorism involving British deaths was
                            continuing unabated. The British Government could not justify the
                            negotiations dragging on indefinitely and believed the time had come to
                            bring the discussions to an end on the basis of making the January 13
                            formula as a final offer.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> then asked the
                            Secretary his reaction to what he had said, and the Secretary replied
                            that he could not give him an immediate reaction but would have to study
                            the papers and memoranda which Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1"
                                >Roger</persName> had given him. The Secretary said that during the
                            1930’s he had written a book on war, peace, and change,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d157fn6">Reference is to <persName>Dulles</persName>’ book,
                                    <hi rend="italic">War, Peace and Change</hi> (New York: Harper
                                &amp; Brothers, 1939).</note> pointing out that when change was
                            indicated, it was necessary to go out to meet the situation and not to
                            let it wait, because the longer it waited, the more difficult it became.
                            If changing situations could be recognized in advance, and met,
                            frequently solutions could be obtained on a basis which was no longer
                            practicable as the situation deteriorated. The French had not recognized
                            this, and this had been to a considerable extent responsible for the
                            difficulties in Indochina and North Africa. The Secretary said he was
                            not prejudging the British position with respect to Cyprus, but was
                            stating a general principle in which he believed.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> said he agreed with
                            this principle and the British had followed it in many places including,
                            most recently, Malaya. He said the British were taking a serious risk in
                            Malaya and Kenya by moving toward self-government when terrorism was
                            still continuing, but this risk they felt obliged to take to keep in
                            step with the times. The Cyprus situation was different, however, in
                            that it did not just involve the simple problem of colonial rule in
                            dependent territory evolving toward self-government, since Turkey was
                            involved. There were limits beyond which the British could not go
                            without having the Turks blow up, which would create real UK-Turkish
                            problems, increase the present difficulties between Greece and Turkey,
                            and hence impair and undermine the whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> foundation.</p>
                        <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>It was left that the Secretary and the Department would study the papers
                            and would communicate with the British in due course, particularly with
                            respect to their request that the US Consul in Cyprus be instructed on
                            the basis of his present substantive instructions, to approach the
                            Archbishop just before Sir <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">John

                                    asked whether we had indicated our view that the present British
                                    proposal is an extremely negative document. Mr. <persName

                                    realistic to expect the Archbishop to condemn publicly the
                                    Cypriot nationalist movement as “terroristic”. The desired
                                    result might be achieved, the Embassy concluded, if <persName

                                        advantage to that, from British viewpoint, would be that

                            formula would not commit himself in advance to any particular form of
                            constitution. This would be subject future negotiations within framework
                            principles of formula. Also, if form of constitution is evolved through
                            gradual negotiation it more apt to be useful than if Archbishop and his
                            advisors hastily lay down conditions on which they require advance
                            assent.</p>
                        <p>Department appreciates Archbishop’s desire see constitution before
                            supporting formula, but suggests he would be in stronger position should

                            If he publicly states in advance conditions under which self-government
                            would be acceptable, he would be exposed criticism from extreme

                        <p>At the same time, it is our view that the legitimate interests of our

                            appropriate occasions we have sought to reconcile the various points of
                            view through quiet diplomacy rather than through public debate.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Cyprus question can be solved only when those who are
                            primarily concerned have come to the point where they trust and

                            and in course hours discussion urged repeatedly and as strongly as I
                            could that if agreement now to be reached, which we firmly believe
                            possible, each side must place necessary degree of trust on other.
                            Department’s caution was timely and he was at pains to make explicit
                            that US was not underwriting British offer; nor was I either advocate
                            for British or attempting to act as intermediary. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said he had not been advised
                            by Greek Government of President’s letter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> turned immediately to
                            question of constitution and concentrated with great earnestness on
                            point of proportionate representation in legislature. He asked if I
                            could tell him what form of constitution US Govt would regard as
                            providing genuine self government. I said that I could not of course
                            give him either official statement or personal opinion on specific
                            constitutional provisions, but as he knew and President said Americans
                            believed fundamentally in ideal of self-rule and right of peoples to
                            governments of their own choice. Moreover, again there was no doubt in
                            my mind what British intended and there was no rush carry out intention
                            to give wide measure of self government and, in their words, work for
                            final solution which would include satisfaction of wishes of people of
                            Cyprus. I understood British position to be that exact definition of
                            composition of legislature was one of several matters which could be
                            accomplished only in open discussions and they had stated principles
                            which they believed constitution should contain in such way as to make
                            possible necessary cooperation of all elements. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> acknowledged that mutual
                            trust was required but insisted that permission merely of “an elected
                            majority” was not sufficient guarantee, only opened up danger of dispute
                            with Turks later, was not necessary for Turk’s agreement now to
                            cooperate, and did not give him sufficient reason for his confidence and
                            understanding which I was requesting. He said this several different
                            times in different ways but did not deviate at all from his contention,
                            and said this was a fundamental matter of substance. Repeatedly he asked
                            “if British intend government to be self government why can they not now
                            make clear statement on this point?” He indicated no wish to bring up
                            any other constitutional points and virtually said this was only
                            remaining difference.</p>
                        <p>On question of amnesty he apparently now was quite flexible dismissing it
                            as “subject for later discussion and agreement reached <pb n="343"
                                xml:id="pg_343" facs="0373"/>on constitution” and at least implying
                            that he could not expect it to obstruct cooperation.</p>

                                    >Courtney</persName> learned that in the Archbishop’s view,
                                “total amnesty” meant that no death sentence for “political”
                                offenses would be carried out; all sentences for
                                “political-criminal” activities set by regular courts would be
                                reviewed; all sentences imposed under emergency regulations would be
                                lifted; and all political prisoners and detainees would be released.

                        <p>Believe fact that British spokesman at September London Conference

                            “proportionate representation” and they have since eliminated it, is a
                            direct factor in reviving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> mistrust and has, besides, weakened their

                            British do actually intend that Greek Cypriots should have majority in
                            Assembly (which I believe they do) but at same time allow Turks to have

                            are evidently still difficulties in the way of full agreement between
                            the Archbishop and ourselves, though until the Colonial Secretary has
                            returned and been able to report in person, we cannot tell just how wide
                            the gap still is.</p>
                        <p>In all the circumstances we cannot delay further before making our
                            position public. Parliament is deeply interested in this question and
                            has shown great forbearance. They should not be kept in the dark longer
                            than is absolutely necessary especially since there have been many leaks
                            from the Greek side. The correspondence with the Archbishop, which we
                            intend to publish in full with the Archbishop’s agreement, will show the
                            extent of common ground as well as the remaining differences. It may
                            thus be expected to reassure the moderates in Cyprus and so strengthen
                            the Archbishop against the extremists. I am also mindful of the
                            positions of the Greek and Turkish Governments both of whom have their
                            internal difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Our objective remains of course to reach agreement with the communities
                            in Cyprus. Meanwhile I think our statement will have the advantage of
                            clearing the atmosphere and I hope it will be beneficial not least in
                            making apparent the sincerity of our position.</p>
                        <p>I am indeed grateful for the assistance you have given us in this long
                            and difficult negotiation. I was especially grateful for your support

                            immediately ahead. Sequence of events may well be drawing Greece into
                            real crisis in its relations with Western allies and we must expect that
                            US relationship with Greece will be subject severe strain in coming
                            months.</p>

                            embittered than that which followed Istanbul riots last September.
                            Prospects that <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            Government would have opportunity get itself organized and get down to
                            work now jeopardized as popular passions mounting to peak which some
                            local observers say unknown since Italian invasion 1940. Thus far
                            government has kept cool head and police and military authorities are in
                            control of situation, but government leaders are finding themselves
                            impelled to give consideration to courses of action in foreign policy
                            which likely prove injurious US interests.</p>
                        <p>For example, serious study being given proposal to send Cabinet Minister
                            on special mission to Arab Capitals to make sure Arab support for
                            Greek-Cypriot cause. Greek church has, as previously reported, appealed
                            to Moscow Patriarch for support. Greek journalist has been informed by
                            Yugoslav military Attaché that Tito trying to arrange meeting with King

                        <p>Under pressure of violent press and popular emotionalism government will
                            thus find it hard not to risk some dramatic move aimed at showing
                            “independent” Greek foreign policy. I feel sure Greek Government will
                            not yield to this temptation if provided with some tangible evidence
                            that Greece is not isolated or “abandoned” by all her allies. Now even
                            more than last September the key to Greece’s remaining firmly within
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> family lies in US willingness

                        <p>In connection with foregoing I noted with special interest comments made

                                they stressed that the United States recognizes that the “breakdown

                            <p rend="center">March 13, 1956</p>
                            <p>American Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1">Cavendish W.
                                    Cannon</persName> called on Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> shortly after noon today
                                to discuss matters of mutual interest. He took occasion to express
                                the sympathetic concern of the United States Government and the
                                American people over the recent developments in Cyprus and to convey
                                to the Foreign Minister the text of the statement issued in
                                Washington yesterday by the State Department.</p>
                            <p>This statement emphasized that the United States Government had no
                                advance information of the deportation of Archbishop Makarios. It
                                disclosed that the United States is making a careful study of the
                                situation and expects to make certain recommendations when that
                                study is completed. It recalled the continued interest of the United
                                States in the establishment of a government truly representative of
                                the people of Cyprus, and said that until the negotiations were
                                interrupted recently the United States had been encouraged by the
                                steady progress made during the last few months.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador himself, in reviewing this progress, recalled that
                                agreement had been reached on the principle of self-determination,
                                on a wide measure of self-government as a transitory stage and on
                                satisfying the aspirations of the Cypriot people in the final
                                solution.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador expressed the confident belief that, taking into
                                account the very substantial progress along the lines of these broad
                                principles, a way could surely be found to work out the details and
                                the timing, complicated and difficult though these may be. The
                                important thing is to re-create an atmosphere in which the questions
                                can be calmly re-examined.</p>
                            <p>Finally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1">Cannon</persName>
                                said he had taken particular note of the dignity and statesmanship
                                with which the Greek Government had dealt with the current
                                situation.</p>

                                Cairo, then to Paris, and finally to London.</note> Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone Kirkpatrick</persName> said that he was
                            very concerned over the problem of “squaring the circle”, by which he
                            meant how to reconcile Turkish and Greek interests. …</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> continued that the
                            Turkish point of view was not sufficiently appreciated in the United
                            States. The plain facts were that Cyprus could not be given to Greece
                            without provoking a war between Greece and Turkey. Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> said he wished to make it plain
                            that he was not defending the Turkish point of view. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> had taken the position at the
                            London conference that Turkey did not want either self-determination or
                            self-government for Cyprus and that if the British did not agree with
                            the Turkish position, Turkey would have to reconsider its relations with
                            Britain. <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> had said as much
                            right in Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName>’s office and
                            Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> had had to reply “with
                            some acerbity”. The Turks insisted on equal representation for Turks and
                            Greeks in any legislature that was set up in Cyprus. At the same time,
                            the Archbishop in the negotiations had insisted on a Greek majority and
                            the negotiations had broken down when the British, having in mind their
                            pledge to the Turks to consult them regarding this point, had had to
                            tell the Archbishop that they could not agree to his conditions in
                            advance of the proposed constitutional consultations which were to be
                            carried out by Lord Radcliffe.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> commented that as far
                            as the Turkish attitude was concerned it was necessary to recall that
                            for five hundred years the Greeks had been “shouting it from the house
                            tops” that they would like to conquer and dismember Turkey. It was
                            natural in view of this history that the Turks should oppose the cession
                            to Greece of <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0382"/>the last remaining
                            block of Greek-speaking people outside Greek possession. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he was aware of this
                            feeling on the part of the Turks but he wondered how justified it was.
                            Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> replied that
                            regardless of the justification, the feeling existed. …</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> went on to read from a
                            telegram in front of him which gave the text of a proposed U.S. Senate
                            resolution regarding Cyprus, in which reference was made to the
                            traditional American support of the principle of self-determination. He
                            said that he would like to point out that the United States had not
                            always supported the principle of self-determination in every given
                            case, any more than had Great Britain. There were cases where national
                            security or the preservation of world peace were overriding
                            considerations. He cited the Sudeten Germans, Trieste, and Austria as
                            instances in which the United States had not supported the principle of
                            self-determination. … Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> took issue with Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName>’s comments regarding
                            the exceptions which he had cited, pointing out that the Trieste problem
                            had been solved along lines which very largely gave the Italians to
                            Italy and the Slavs to Yugoslavia and that the United States had not
                            been a party to the 1938 Munich agreement on Czechoslovakia. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> agreed with Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> that Austria presented
                            a difficult problem but expressed the personal view that if in the
                            future the Austrian people should decide overwhelmingly that they wanted
                            to join Germany it would be hard to deny this. Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> rejoined that while it was true
                            that the Trieste problem had eventually been settled more or less along
                            ethnic lines, neither the United States nor Great Britain had been very
                            worried about the wishes of the inhabitants of the Zone at the time of
                            the 1948 Italian elections, when we had come out in favor of the entire
                            territory going to Italy. As far as the Sudetens were concerned, he
                            thought that our concurrence in 1945 in the return of the territory to
                            Czechoslovakia was proof of our real attitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> commented that while
                            there might be some exceptions, it was certainly true that in the vast
                            majority of cases the United States had been in favor of
                            self-determination. With regard to the deportation of Archbishop
                            Makarios to the Seychelles he said that some people in the Middle East
                            and Asia were concerned over this development since they thought of
                            other nationalist leaders like Zaghloul<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">Sa’d
                                Zaghlul, Egyptian politician and prominent nationalist, who was
                                exiled on two occasions for his nationalist activities—once to Malta
                                in 1919 and a second time to Aden and Gibraltar in 1922.</note> who
                            had been sent to the Seychelles and who had eventually returned to their
                            countries with increased stature. Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Ivone</persName> remarked that he did not think it was possible for
                            the Archbishop to have greater stature than he already possessed in <pb
                                n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0383"/>Cyprus, and in Greece, where he
                            was able to give orders to the Greek Government. He said that one thing
                            which had struck him in talking to the Colonial Secretary, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LBA1">Lennox-Boyd</persName>, after latter’s return from
                            a recent trip to Cyprus, was the extent to which it was commonly
                            believed all over the Island that the Archbishop was behind the
                            terrorists. Whatever the actual connection of the Archbishop with the
                            terrorists the point was that this was the general impression in Cyprus.
                            This of course greatly increased the standing of the terrorists in the
                            community.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> inquired whether it
                            would not be possible to make public more of the evidence which the
                            British Government apparently had, linking the Archbishop with the
                            terrorist movement. Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName>
                            said he could see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName>’s
                            point, but the release of the information might raise certain
                            difficulties. At all events, there was enough evidence, he felt, to show
                            that the Archbishop was supporting the terrorists and was supplying them
                            with money, especially money which he obtained in the United States,
                            although whether he was actually directing the terrorist operations was
                            another question. He was probably more the “chairman of the board” than
                            the “managing director”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> inquired regarding Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName>’s reference to the
                            collection of money by the Archbishop in the United States and said that
                            he did not recall this. Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Ivone</persName> said that the last time the Archbishop had gone to
                            the United States, about eighteen months ago, he was reported to have
                            raised and brought back considerable funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he wanted to
                            assure Sir <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> that we fully
                            understood the fact that the British were dealing with an immensely
                            complex problem in Cyprus and that we were anxious to be as helpful and
                            sympathetic as possible in bringing about a reasonable solution. Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Ivone</persName> expressed his
                            appreciation for this statement.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> next spoke of a
                            press interview held on March 18, 1956 at the Turkish Embassy in
                            Washington which was attended by the Turkish Ambassador, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GH1">Görk</persName>, and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS1">Sarper</persName>. The reports of this meeting
                            indicated that Turkey would be willing to go to war if Cyprus became
                            independent or was granted self-determination. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> said that with the previous
                            knowledge of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George V. Allen</persName>
                            he had issued a press communiqué in reply which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> had acknowledged to be
                            moderate.</p>
                        <p>In general Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> said
                            his Government felt negotiations had come so close to success that it
                            was regrettable that they were now in abeyance. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> wondered when the British
                            Government would commence real self-government on the Island of Cyprus
                            in which each community would be proportionately represented. He
                            concluded by emphasizing that only two things were needed to restore the
                            situation: first, the restoration of Archbishop Makarios, whom no one
                            could replace; and, secondly, real self-government for Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that these developments had occurred while he was
                            away, but that he had since tried to acquaint himself with them. It had
                            seemed that for a moment agreement was very close. He did not want to
                            express judgment as to the responsibility for the breaking of the
                            negotiations, but it was certainly regrettable. He believed that the
                            ground which had been gained could be recaptured and further advances
                            made.</p>
                        <p>It was important to do away with the mood of terrorism and violence. He
                            hoped the Government of Greece could contribute as this would help to
                            achieve the result which they wanted. He said <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0389"/>that the Government of Greece had shown
                            a responsible attitude on the whole, but did feel that the radio
                            broadcasts had been inflammatory. He asked that the Government of Greece
                            do all it could as he was confident the matter could be pushed through
                            to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> replied that the
                            Greek Government was not pulling the strings which caused the <gloss
                                target="#t_EOKA1">EOKA</gloss> violence on Cyprus. He mentioned
                            British methods on the island, such as the deportation of the
                            Archbishop, the use of dogs in searching Cypriot churches, and the
                            curfew, as things which in themselves were contributory to the
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not mean to suggest that this was
                            one-sided. Referring to Greece’s participation in the Malta maneuvers
                            and to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’
                            statement, the Secretary said that Greece had made a real
                            contribution.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> referred to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s statement
                            in his press conference of April 4, 1956 to the effect that peace could
                            only be preserved in the Middle East if all the people of that area had
                            the opportunity of achieving their legitimate aspirations.<note n="5"

                                the Greek view was that Cyprus issue could never be resolved until
                                some date had been set.</note>). Aside from fact that this would
                            impose new condition which would be difficult to negotiate, United

                            felt unless something constructive could be expected it would be unwise
                            particularly since airing dispute between Greece, Turkey and United
                            Kingdom would be exploited by Soviet propaganda and perhaps weaken
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Secretary agreed it not wise
                            raise question for debate since it would not advance solution to
                            problem. He might himself refer to issue in passing merely to identify
                            the kind of problems with which we were confronted. He said discussion
                            of issue was not end in itself but merely means to an end, and thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> wise in not
                            precipitating debate unless it would be helpful. He felt matters of this
                            nature should be of concern to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            but at much earlier date. Situation should never have been permitted to

                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> we should endeavor avoid possibility
                            disputes this nature reaching stage where free world collaboration
                            impeded.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> asked that United States
                            endeavor improve Turkish attitude, and hoped we could inform United
                            Kingdom that if Cyprus again raised in United Nations they could not
                            expect United States attitude would be same as in past. He also hoped we
                            would urge upon British necessity for finding prompt solution. He said
                            Greeks did not want to take matter to United Nations since that might
                            create new strains in relations between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Selwyn</hi>: I continue to be apprehensive with
                            regard to the many facets of the Cyprus question which are of the utmost
                                <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0393"/>importance not only to
                            Britain, but also to the entire Western Alliance. As you know from our
                            several talks on the subject I am well aware of the difficulties which
                            it presents to you. I have clearly in mind the importance of Cyprus as a
                            British base.</p>
                        <p>I would greatly appreciate hearing from you with regard to the results of
                            any further examination of this problem which you and your colleagues
                            may have made in light of our conversation in Paris,<note n="2"

                                tension on Cyprus in April and May. On May 27, as a result of
                                opposition to the Greek Government’s policies on Cyprus, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> resigned. The government
                                was accused of failing to support the case of self-determination for
                                Cyprus.</note></p>
                        <p>It would seem that now, even more than when we spoke about it on May 3,
                            would be a propitious time to take steps which might break what appears
                            to be a deadlock between violence and its suppression. In considering
                            such steps I hope that the possibility of finding some way to resume
                            negotiations with Archbishop Makarios will not be excluded. I realize
                            that this presents very great difficulties, but it seems to me
                            improbable that another person can in present or foreseeable
                            circumstances carry on negotiations in his absence with any degree of
                            support among the Cypriots. Such a person would have to win away the
                            loyalty which the Archbishop now receives from the Greek populace and,
                            during a time when passions are high, achieve a reasonable understanding
                            which would be supported by the people.</p>
                        <p>I am taking the opportunity to write you again on this unhappy subject in
                            the earnest belief that a frank exchange of views is in our mutual
                            interest. I would also reiterate that we stand ready to use our best
                            influence to facilitate the attainment of an understanding.<note n="4"

                                Harding</persName> is here and we have had some long talks over this
                            anxious Cyprus business. I would like to give you for your own personal
                            information one or two conclusions which emerge. First, as to the
                            security situation. We have now reached the stage at which we are able
                            to hit back at the terrorists, and to continue this process. Our forces
                            had a marked success against the guerilla bands about a week ago. The
                            whole operation was planned with great care and was well executed. As a
                            result we have broken up two of the bands and have captured the leaders
                            of two more. <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> estimates
                            that there are probably five or six more bands, of moderate size, in
                            various parts of the island, but their total strength is probably not
                            more than sixty full-time terrorists. Therefore this aspect of security
                            should continue to show improvement over the next few months.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there has always been a real anxiety about Greek and
                            Turkish communal riots in Cyprus. Though the Turks say less than the
                            Greeks it does not mean that they feel less, and their anxiety about
                            their future has put them into a highly excitable state. They are
                            violently determined against Enosis. There is also a considerable
                            population of Turkish-Cypriots in Turkey itself which plays its part in
                            moulding Turkish opinion. I believe they number a quarter of a million
                            or more. If anything in the nature of widespread communal disturbances
                            were to break out this would put a heavy and most disagreeable task upon
                            our forces which would have to try to keep the parties apart and restore
                            order. This could be more costly in casualties than anything we have to
                            cope with now, and would divert our forces from operations against the
                            terrorists.</p>
                        <p>We are of course also discussing the various political aspects of this
                            problem. The truth is that the offer which we made to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> at the end of our last
                            negotiations went beyond what the Turks themselves thought we should
                            have offered. This the Turkish Prime Minister has said publicly. To
                            attempt to get results by offering more in this direction would
                            inevitably entail strong Turkish reactions which would have very serious
                            consequences for the security and stability of the Middle East as a
                            whole. Nor would I feel confident of facilities in Cyprus under present
                            conditions unless we had control of internal security. Athens Radio has
                            made it plain <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0395"/>enough that the
                            Greeks would not in any event be willing to allow our facilities in
                            Cyprus to be used for any purposes connected with the Middle East. That
                            is just what we might want them for. A N.A.T.O. base by itself would
                            meet only part of our needs.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that either of our countries would be really happy if we
                            were only able to counter a threat to vital oil supplies in the Persian
                            Gulf from landing grounds in Arab lands.</p>
                        <p>You will know that Kuwait by itself has now twenty per cent of the proved
                            oil reserves of the world, and all the indications are that the economy
                            of Western Europe will increasingly depend on oil supplies from that
                            area over the next twenty years or more. I just cannot take the risk of
                            finding ourselves unable to protect these supplies should the need
                            arise. But I did want you to know that I am working hard and will
                            attempt to find some means of reconciling our needs with rival Greek and
                            Turkish aspirations in the island.</p>
                        <p>If any new thought emerges from all this effort I will not hesitate to
                            let you know, and of course <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn

                                    p.m., <persName>Dulles</persName> met with the President. Among
                                    the topics of conversation was Cyprus. According to the
                                    memorandum of conversation, the following exchange occurred:</p>
                                <p>“We went over the letter from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                        >Eden</persName> about Cyprus which we agreed was not very
                                    informative. We discussed generally the weakening British
                                    position, both political and economic.</p>
                                <p>“In the course of a somewhat rambling discussion, the President
                                    raised the question as to whether it was feasible to separate
                                    the Turkish population from the Greek. I said my recollection
                                    was that this was not regarded as practical because they were
                                    working in the mines and were part of the general life of the
                                    island. We discussed the proximity of the island to Turkey and
                                    the strong opposition that Turkey would have to its becoming
                                    Greek.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with the

                                    the President and that he was struck by the length and lack of
                                    substance of the Prime Minister’s communication. According to
                                    the Ambassador, the message was an attempt to impress the
                                    President with the fact that Britain was giving serious
                                    consideration to a solution of the Cyprus problem. (Department

                                he had learned of a proposed British approach on the Cyprus problem.
                                The British planned to make a public statement on Cyprus that would
                                indicate they were prepared to proceed with the formulation of a
                                constitution and that Lord Radcliffe was ready to travel to Cyprus
                                for that purpose. <persName corresp="#p_AWW1">Aldrich</persName>
                                reported that the constitution would provide a bicameral legislature
                                with the first chamber on a proportional basis according to
                                population and the second divided equally between Greeks and Turks.
                                Unless the Turkish reaction to the proposal was so negative as to
                                make it completely unacceptable, <persName corresp="#p_AWW1"
                                    >Aldrich</persName> continued, the British planned to indicate
                                that after a suitable period, possibly 10 years, they might refer
                                the matter to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to discuss
                                whether transfer of sovereignty of the island, if approved by a

                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 747C.00/6–1556)</note> However, there was one
                            significant change in procedure, namely that British approach to Turks
                            would be undertaken before you had an opportunity to comment. Cabinet
                            felt that you might prefer not to be associated with the approach to the
                            Turks and thus be in a position to deny foreknowledge. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> was concerned that this
                            procedural development might be contrary to promise he had given me that
                            no steps would be taken without first receiving US comments. It was of
                            course one of main purposes my conversation reported <gloss
                                target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5803 to head off British action
                            without reference to Washington. On other hand he did make clear on that
                            occasion that views he was expressing and the substance of the proposal
                            were yet to be determined by cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Only substantive addition to proposed statement resulting from Cabinet
                            meeting appears to be that, in addition to other stipulated conditions
                            for eventual transfer sovereignty, it would also be provided that a
                            security treaty relating to the island would be concluded <pb n="367"
                                xml:id="pg_367" facs="0397"/>between the British, Greeks and Turks.
                            This designed assure Turks that they would ultimately have major say in
                            transfer together with UK and Greece.</p>
                        <p>British Ambassador Ankara has been instructed to raise proposed statement
                            with Turks today, and if he is successful in reaching them, British
                            anticipate instructing <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> to
                            see you tomorrow. With regard to British course in the event of a
                            strongly adverse Turkish reaction, <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> said that he anticipates the Turks may “go through
                            the roof”. If they do so, British will, as forecast <gloss
                                target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5803, revise statement to omit
                            section on self-determination. However, before making such revision they
                            will wish to take into account estimate of British Ambassador in Ankara,
                            on whose judgment they rely heavily. If he really considers statement on
                            self-determination would result in Turkish withdrawal from <gloss

                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s attitude implied, however,
                            that if the Turkish reaction seems likely to entail almost anything less
                            drastic than withdrawal, British will proceed with statement as now

                                    <persName>Dulles</persName>, June 19, transmitting a message
                                from <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> to
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName>. The message indicated that the main
                                British problem in handling Cyprus was the Turks. According to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>, the new British
                                proposal provided “reasonable safeguards” for the Turkish position,
                                but the Turks would need “a lot of persuading” if they were to
                                accept this. (Department of State, Presidential Correspondence: Lot

                            outlined the British proposal for a solution of the Cyprus question. The
                            Secretary read this proposal very carefully.</p>
                        <p>He asked what was the relative size of the Turkish population on the
                            Island and was told that it was about one-fifth. He said that this would
                            then not give the Turkish Cypriots a veto on the question of
                            self-determination since a two-thirds majority was required. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> agreed. The
                            Secretary then observed that this was obviously an important statement
                            which he desired to study and on which he would want advice. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> then described the
                            statement as being the absolute limit to which the British would go. He
                            said it was imaginative; that it might, with the support of our friends,
                            win world opinion. He continued by saying that the British Government
                            had shown it to the Turkish Government yesterday and that it had had a
                            “rough reception.” The Turkish Foreign Minister had said he wished to
                            study it but felt the plan was dangerous since it was apt to make the
                            Greeks more intransigent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked if the treaty provisions of the plan did not
                            give the Turks in effect a veto, since if they did not adhere, the plan
                            would not commence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1"
                                >Coulson</persName> agreed that this was so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> said that, acting
                            on instructions, he had two questions to ask: <list>

                        <p>The Secretary answered that in order to understand the proposition better
                            he would like to ask a few questions himself. He asked whether the
                            defense treaty would run on beyond the date of “so called
                            self-determination?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1"
                                >Coulson</persName> replied in the affirmative. The Secretary then
                            asked whether if at some future date the Island wanted to join Greece
                            would the United Kingdom still be responsible for external defense? The
                            answer was “Yes.” The Secretary then asked about the provision that the
                            question of self-determination should not be raised or discussed
                            publicly or between the three powers involved. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> answered that this was to
                            prevent the Greeks from pressing the question. He believed something of
                            the sort had been done for the Saar. Miss <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                >Salt</persName> added that this provision was for the benefit of
                            the Turks and to prevent the question from being raised in the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the British had had an exchange of views with
                            the Greeks. Minister <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName>
                            replied “No,” because the British Ambassador in Athens had reported that
                            the Greeks would want to negotiate immediately. The Secretary observed
                            that we have no voice in this question except as the British Government
                            desired us to have one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1"
                                >Coulson</persName> replied that the British Government was very
                            anxious to hear our answers. The Secretary said that we would like time
                            to think the matter over. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1"
                                >Coulson</persName> indicated that they expected a formal answer
                            from the Turks fairly soon. Miss <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                >Salt</persName> added that there was already a good deal of
                            accurate press speculation and that the British would have to act fairly
                            quickly. The Secretary indicated that he would attempt to give an answer
                            the following day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> then asked if the
                            Secretary would agree not to give any details of this plan to the Greeks
                            or our Embassy in Athens since there was a considerable danger of leaks.
                            The Secretary indicated that he would restrict the information as
                                requested.<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">On June 19,

                                chance of its acceptance by Greece. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                concluded that he thought the plan had little chance of acceptance

                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government intend to press ahead with the framing of a
                            constitution for Cyprus on the lines which have been previously offered
                            for consideration. For this purpose they have decided to ask Lord
                            Radcliffe as Constitutional Commissioner to start work forthwith on the
                            framing of a constitution. It is their hope that, at an early stage, the
                            Constitutional Commissioner will be able to bring into consultation
                            representatives of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government will put such a constitution into effect as soon
                            as possible, provided that terrorism has been eliminated and law and
                            order have been fully restored.</p>
                        <p>As regards the future status of the Island, Her Majesty’s Government have
                            already accepted the principle of self-determination. It shall be a
                            condition of any change in the international status of Cyprus that a
                            treaty shall be concluded between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey,
                            regulating in their common interest the use of Cyprus for military
                            purposes. Such a treaty, which would be terminable only by agreement
                            between the parties, would provide that the United Kingdom should
                            continue to be responsible for the external defence of Cyprus and to
                            enjoy such facilities in the Island as may be necessary for this purpose
                            and for that of discharging British Treaty obligations in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean or the Middle East. Provision would be made in the Treaty
                            for defence zones over which the United Kingdom would retain permanent
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>It shall similarly be a condition that the implementation of a decision
                            to change the international status of Cyprus would be made dependent on
                            a special treaty arrangement by which the interests of minority racial
                            groups were fully safeguarded.</p>
                        <p>At the end of ten years from the date on which the new constitution comes
                            into effect, Her Majesty’s Government will be prepared to raise with
                            their fellow members of N.A.T.O. the question whether, in the situation
                            then obtaining, a change in the international status of Cyprus would be
                            compatible with the interests of Western defence in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>If not fewer than two-thirds of the members of N.A.T.O. answer the
                            question put to them in the affirmative and the treaties referred to in
                            paragraphs 3 and 4 above have been concluded, a plebiscite will be <pb

                            would be required in order that a decision involving a change in
                            international status should take effect. It is an essential element of

                        <p>During a meeting between the Secretary and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> on June 22, in the course of
                            which various other subjects were discussed, the Ambassador raised the
                            question of Cyprus. He referred to the meeting which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName> had had with the Secretary
                            on June 19 when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1">Coulson</persName>
                            presented the draft text of a proposed British announcement which
                            already was under discussion with the Turks. (The Secretary had at that
                            time made certain observations concerning the British proposal but said
                            that he wished to consider the matter further before expressing his
                            considered judgment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJESJM1"
                                >Coulson</persName> called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName>, in the Secretary’s absence, on June 20<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d180fn2">The highlights of the Department’s reaction to the
                                latest British proposals on Cyprus were transmitted to London in
                                telegram 7694, June 21. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                                747C.00/6–2156) Among the Department’s objections to the proposal
                                was the statement that no move in the direction of
                                self-determination should be made before the conclusion of a
                                British-Turkish-Greek defense treaty. This condition, the Department
                                argued, would be interpreted by Greece as an attempt to give Turkey
                                a “built-in veto” with which to block any progress toward
                                self-determination.</note> and was informed of the Department’s
                            reaction to the suggestions <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0402"
                            />which had been put forth by the British. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> wished to pursue this
                            discussion with the Secretary.)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the British thus far had received no answer from
                            the Turks, although there were indications that the Turks would be most
                            reluctant to acquiesce in the proposals. He said that, as he understood
                            it, three reservations had been expressed by the Department: (1) upon
                            the wisdom of the “built-in veto” which the Turks would have over the
                            implementation of the self-determination feature of the proposal after
                            the expiration of a ten-year period of self-government; (2) upon the
                            British view that the plan should not be discussed with the Greeks
                            before it was made public; and (3) regarding the arrangements for
                            assuring an elected majority in the Parliament under the proposed
                            Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the Ambassador said that it was extremely difficult to
                            evaluate the Turkish position since, on the whole, they were extremely
                            inarticulate and often failed to make a case for themselves. It
                            appeared, however, that the Turks felt that the safeguards incorporated
                            in the plan were inadequate for their purposes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the principal objection to the British
                            proposal, as he saw it, was the provision that settlement of the
                            question of self-determination would depend upon a British-Greek-Turkish
                            treaty, even in advance of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            consideration of the problem. He said that at present the Turks would
                            have no legal basis to obstruct a settlement, but that under the terms
                            of the proposals, if they were accepted by the Greeks and Turks, they
                            would know that they would have the legal power to stall the
                            implementation of the self-determination feature. Thus, the British
                            would be depriving themselves of their present sole legal responsibility
                            in the matter and would bring about a divided authority which might
                            cause trouble in future years.</p>
                        <p>The comment was made to the British Ambassador that, aside from the
                            question of the Turkish attitude, it might be conceivable that the
                            situation in ten years would be such as to render it inadvisable for the
                            Greeks themselves to have the veto power implicit in the proposals. The
                            plan as now worded would, for example, effectively preclude the
                            establishment of Cyprus independence under dominion status or as part of
                            the Commonwealth if the political situation in Greece or the attitudes
                            of the Cypriots themselves in the years ahead should render it otherwise
                            feasible to consider a solution along those lines. The Secretary
                            remarked that the British goal was highly commendable, that he fully
                            appreciated the difficulties confronting the British Government in
                            trying to work out a solution to this enormously complicated problem,
                            and that he knew the proposals put forward had been formulated in good
                            faith and in an earnest effort to find some satisfactory course. He was,
                            nevertheless, seriously concerned over the possible implications.</p>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that he thought neither the Greeks nor the Turks
                            could effectively block implementation of the plan at the expiration of
                            the ten-year period in view of the fact that they could not withstand
                            the international pressures for a just solution. He remarked, in this
                            connection, that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> itself would be
                            seized with the problem and would apply pressures against the Greeks and
                            the Turks to undertake the proposed treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that neither the Greeks nor the Turks were nearly
                            as sensitive to international pressures as the United States or Great
                            Britain; he doubted that it would be safe to rely upon this as an
                            assurance that the treaty would be concluded. He pointed out that,
                            according to his understanding of the proposals, the matter would not be
                            referred to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the absence of the
                            treaty itself; thus it would be difficult to envisage a situation in
                            which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could effectively pressure
                            the Greeks and Turks to come to an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that while some difficulties might be involved in
                            concluding the treaty, a ten-year period was provided for an
                            introduction of a constitution and the establishment and refinement of
                            self-government. That in itself would be a great gain. He indicated, in
                            response to the Secretary’s question, that the self-government aspects
                            of the proposals could go forward in the absence of a Greek-Turkish
                            agreement either to undertake a treaty for the defense of Cyprus, or an
                            agreement on the part of the Greeks and Turks not to raise the question
                            of self-determination during the ten-year period mentioned in the
                            proposals. The Secretary observed that he had not understood the
                            proposed statement to indicate that to be the case.</p>
                        <p>Responding to further questions by the Secretary, the Ambassador
                            expressed his understanding that Greek and Turkish agreement was not
                            needed to put into motion the self-government provisions, but that they
                            merely had to “acquiesce.” The Secretary asked what the situation would
                            be, for example, if two years following the institution of
                            self-government, the Greeks should press the question of
                            self-determination and ask that this matter be inscribed on the agenda
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador’s reply was
                            that the British would naturally oppose inscription, but he was not
                            clear as to the effect such Greek action would have upon the time
                            schedule for carrying out the self-determination feature of the
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he assumed the primary question which had been
                            put to him was whether we would urge the Turks to accept the British
                            proposals. The Ambassador responded that it was whether we would use our
                            influence with the Turks in this matter and persuade them to acquiesce
                            in the proposals. The Secretary said that he frankly had grave
                            reservations about the merits of the proposals. He believed that
                            confusion would be compounded if an <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374"
                                facs="0404"/>arrangement were concluded whereby the concurrence of
                            both Greece and Turkey would be needed before any determination were
                            made on self-determination, rather than maintaining a situation in which
                            the UK would retain its present rights. He thought that under the plan
                            both Greece and Turkey would be given legal rights which they do not now
                            possess, and that this would greatly decrease the flexibility of the
                            British in disposing of the problem. He repeated that he appreciated the
                            great effort which the British were making and realized that, from the
                            British viewpoint, they had proposed a considerable step forward. From
                            his viewpoint, however, he frankly doubted that the plan would work.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the British Ambassador commented with a smile that he was
                            inclined to say “What would you have us do?” The Secretary, also
                            jokingly, replied, “While you may be inclined to do so, you have not
                            asked the question.” The Ambassador responded that he did not have
                            instructions to put this question to us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary summed up his position by saying that he did not think it
                            was a good <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> to diffuse the present
                            role of the British and create a situation in which three powers, rather
                            than one, would have legal authority for agreeing to any course of
                            action. He felt that even if Greece and Turkey should accept the present
                            plan, which appeared unlikely, it would create a situation which ten
                            years hence would be more insoluble than that existing at the present
                            time. He expressed considerable doubt that, even if Turkey should
                            acquiesce, the Greek Government would do so. In the circumstances, he
                            questioned the wisdom of the US undertaking to persuade the Turks to
                            accept the plan.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FAB1">Foster</persName> has told me of the
                            statement which you propose to make on the Cyprus question. He has, I
                            think, some questions which he has raised with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger Makins</persName>. Is it wise, I wonder,
                            for you to dilute your own authority by giving both Greece and Turkey
                            what amounts to an indefinite veto power over any future change in the
                            international status of Cyprus? Might not that further complicate a
                            problem already complicated enough? Of course, they have legitimate
                            interests which should be taken into account. But it seems to me
                            important that the United Kingdom should retain a sufficient initiative
                            and flexibility in its own hands to meet the changing circumstances
                            which are bound to occur in a situation as complicated and as charged

                        <p>The Ambassador called pursuant to my telephone call to him in order to
                            pick up the message from the President to Sir <persName

                        <p>I said to the Ambassador, in giving him the message, that I thought he
                            should know that this was not a perfunctory message, <pb n="376"
                                xml:id="pg_376" facs="0406"/>but that the President had given
                            considerable thought to the problem and that we had discussed it
                            together over the telephone. I also said that while I had made a first
                            draft of the message, the President himself had changed it around so
                            that it would, he thought, accurately reflect his thinking in the way he
                            would like to express himself.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador spoke of the “leak” of our criticism of their proposed

                                the article, suggested that the writer must have had a direct
                                conversation with someone in the Department. According to <persName

                        <p>I expressed my surprise that there should have been any such “leak”,

                            <p>Following the signature of the Agreements regarding St, Lucia and
                                Ascension Islands, I told the Ambassador I had looked into the
                                matter of the “leak” regarding the Cyprus situation. I said that
                                what had happened was that a Reuter’s correspondent had come into
                                the Department and seen a very junior officer, bringing with him a
                                Drew Middleton dispatch about Cyprus. This Middleton dispatch itself
                                disclosed a considerable amount about the British intentions. The
                                correspondent then tried to draw out the Departmental official as to
                                what the attitude of the United States would be. I was reliably
                                informed that he had said he had no <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                    >idea</gloss>, but there then followed what the officer thought
                                was a purely informal conversation about the Middleton dispatch, in
                                the course of which this officer had expressed it as his personal
                                view that such a plan as Middleton reported might be deemed
                                objectionable because it gave the Turks a built-in veto against a
                                change in the international status of Cyprus.</p>
                            <p>I said that while I greatly regretted what had happened, it was not a
                                “leak” of anything that had taken place between the Ambassador and
                                me, as to which the officer in question was totally ignorant.</p>

                            be put into cold storage. Hence the period of years and a submission to

                        <p>You will have heard that the initial Turkish reaction to our proposals
                            was sharp and tough.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">In telegram 2169 from

                            violent than I expected, I am not entirely surprised. The Greeks are
                            good talkers, the Turks are not. But they have a habit of boiling slowly
                            inside. When the lid of the kettle finally blows off, it can be very
                            unpleasant for anyone nearby. Our Ambassador has warned us of the danger
                            of a serious crisis in Anglo-Turkish relations.</p>
                        <p>All this is troublesome to us because we certainly need the Turks both
                            for the Baghdad Pact and for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            Indeed I am sure that you will agree that if anyone holds a strategic
                            position it is they.</p>
                        <p>However we have done all we can to put arguments for our proposals to
                            them and expect to have their considered reply in a day or two. It may
                            be that they will produce some suggestions of their own.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I do not propose to make any kind of public statement,
                            difficult as it will be to refuse our Parliament any information.</p>
                        <p>It was because I am sure that we will never get this matter solved
                            without agreement on military matters that we introduced the conception
                            of a Tripartite Treaty. I do not think that there is anything very new
                            in this.</p>
                        <p>Our formula has much to recommend it to the Greeks. No doubt they will
                            always ask for more. But, all else apart, I am sure <pb n="378"
                                xml:id="pg_378" facs="0408"/>that we cannot go further in placating
                            them without disaster in our relations with the Turks.</p>

                            view and expressed Turkey’s determination to prevent the island from
                            passing to the Greeks. Both leaders emphasized that Turkey was satisfied
                            with the status quo under the British and would not accept the transfer
                            of Cyprus to Greece. Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> reported
                            that he had the impression that the Turkish Government would not yield
                            on this matter and would act decisively “with possible serious
                            consequences” before it would permit the island to be transferred to

                                <p>“Apropos of his visit to Turkey, the Vice President said that he
                                    was amazed to find that the Turks had a positively pathological
                                    attitude on the Cyprus problem. The Prime Minister had even gone
                                    so far as to suggest that if Cyprus was joined to Greece, the
                                    Turks would go to war to prevent it. He had subsequently
                                    modified this statement. The reason for Turkish alarm over
                                    Cyprus, said the Vice President, was rather the closeness of the
                                    island to the Turkish <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0409"

                        </list>
                        <p>When the British Ambassador called this afternoon he said he would like
                            first to bring the Secretary up to date on the latest Cyprus
                            developments. The British Government had felt that it must try some new
                            initiative in this matter and had worked out a plan which it had hoped
                            would be acceptable to Turkey. The British Government would have liked
                            United States support for its proposals with the Turks and eventually
                            with the Greeks. The Ambassador wished the Secretary to know that all
                            available arguments had been used with the Turks to obtain their
                            acceptance but without success. The British had often thought the United
                            States under-estimated the depth of Turkish feeling on Cyprus, but the
                            Turkish reaction had been so strong that it appeared even the British
                            may have been guilty of the same fault. The Turkish response to the
                            proposals, though courteous, was exceedingly strong. In fact, they put
                            the blunt question as to whether it was British policy to abandon
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>When it was apparent no progress could be made along these lines, the
                            British Government had reluctantly decided to abandon this attempt.
                            Finally Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> made this
                            position clear yesterday in Parliament and at the same time announced
                            the British intention of moving ahead with the drafting of a
                            constitution and the immediate <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0410"
                            />dispatch of Lord Radcliffe to Cyprus for preliminary soundings.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">For text of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                    >Eden</persName>’s statement of July 12, see <hi rend="italic"
                                    >H.C. Debs.</hi> 5th series, vol. 556, cols. 595–602.</note>
                            This move involved a calculated risk because it was embarked upon
                            without awaiting the complete cessation of terrorist activities and
                            might be interpreted as a weakening of British policy with respect to
                            Cyprus. <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> hoped to find some support
                            from the United States in this new move.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would be prepared to give support to what
                            appeared to be a sound and constructive step forward. He was sorry that
                            we had not been able to support the previous proposals with the Turks
                            but he doubted whether, even with United States support, the Turks could
                            have been persuaded to agree. The Ambassador knew, the Secretary said,
                            of our reservations on the proposals, which appeared to give both the
                            Greeks and Turks a permanent power of veto and which therefore
                            restricted British freedom of action and flexibility in moving ahead on
                            the question. The Secretary asked whether the Ambassador had any
                            concrete suggestion as to the form of United States support for the new
                            British step. The Ambassador indicated that a public statement would be
                            most welcome, and the sooner the better. The Secretary said he saw no
                            reason why one could not be issued at once.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question about Archbishop Makarios, the Ambassador referred
                            to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement yesterday
                            that, if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> were willing
                            to condemn violence, a new situation would be created. In this
                            connection Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> mentioned
                            secret minutes of Ethnarchy Council deliberations recently captured by
                            the British which seemed to indicate clearly that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had not been negotiating in
                            good faith. He also referred to the Department’s earlier comments<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">Not further identified.</note> on the section
                            of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement which
                            referred to the Lausanne Treaty. He had called our comments to the
                            attention of London but apparently the text had not been changed. He
                            pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had not
                            stated a British position but had merely summarized the Turkish view on
                            the Lausanne Treaty, which was that any change in the status of Cyprus
                            would, by invalidating one provision of the Lausanne Treaty, open up
                            other provisions. In this connection, they had specifically mentioned
                            Western Thrace, the Patriarchate and Greek community in Istanbul, and
                            the Aegean Islands.</p>

                        <p>The Greek Ambassador called today at his request to inform the Secretary
                            that the statement issued by the Department on Saturday (attached)<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Not found attached. The statement released on
                                Saturday, July 14, reads: “The United States welcomes the intention
                                of the British Government, as announced by Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>, to proceed with the

                                171 to Athens, July 14; <hi rend="italic"
                                >ibid.,</hi>747C.00/7–1456)</note> had greatly disturbed his
                            Government, which felt that it denoted an alarming change in United
                            States policy on the Cyprus question. He considered it at variance with
                            the earlier friendly remarks of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> at the time of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> exile, when he said that the
                            United States stood ready to help its two friends, Britain and Greece,
                            who were at odds over the Cyprus question. This new pronouncement, taken
                            within the context of the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            statement, seemed to support the British and Turkish view that Turkey
                            had a right to have the deciding voice regarding the fate of Cyprus. The
                            Ambassador referred to the “pre-arranged proposals” which had been
                            discussed with the Turks and not with the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary informed the Ambassador firmly that he was incorrect if by
                            “pre-arranged” he meant to imply that the United States knew about these
                            proposals before they were made to the Turks. He emphasized that we had
                            no knowledge of them or their content until after they had been
                            presented in Ankara by the British. The Ambassador hastily explained
                            that he meant the proposals had been pre-arranged between the British
                            and the Turks in order to make it appear to the world that no
                            self-determination could ever be granted to Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the statement, the Secretary said that the British
                            also objected to our statement, but for different reasons, because it
                            did not indicate support for anything in the British policy except the
                            offer of early self-government. The Secretary said that our position
                            with respect to self-government was well known: that we wanted more
                            self-government everywhere in the world where people were far enough
                            advanced to have a voice in running their own affairs. The United
                            States, he thought, was entitled to have its policy on this matter
                            without regard to the opinions of other governments, and to state
                            publicly at any time our support for <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382"
                                facs="0412"/>moves toward self-government. He assured the Ambassador
                            that United States policy toward Greece remained unchanged.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, after thanking the Secretary for his assurances,
                            commented that the Turks were “getting out of hand.” They had been
                            making threatening and belligerent statements during recent weeks which
                            went quite beyond the limits of comprehension. He referred to the
                            communiqué just issued by the Assembly group of the Turkish Democrat
                            Party, which stated that, if Greece attempts to annex Cyprus, Turkey
                            will lay claim to Western Thrace and the Dodecanese. The Ambassador
                            pointed out that of course there was no question of “annexation” and
                            spoke emotionally of Turkey’s having renounced categorically and in
                            perpetuity any rights to Cyprus when it signed the Lausanne Treaty.
                            Turkey now pretended that any change in the status quo on Cyprus would

                            the Patriarchate. The Secretary indicated that his legal advisers were
                            inclined to believe there was no sound basis in international law for
                            the thesis that modification of the status quo on Cyprus would
                            automatically reopen the Treaty.</p>

                                    Skouras</persName>, President of Twentieth Century Fox Films,
                                had undertaken, on his own initiative, a mission to persuade the
                                Governments of Greece and Turkey to disengage from the Cyprus
                                problem and to allow the British and the Cypriots to settle the
                                issue. Although Skouras had contact with <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> of Greece. Since you are
                            interested in the question and since he may wish to discuss it with you,
                            a summary follows:</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0413"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that a satisfactory
                            solution depended on (1) an end of terrorism, (2) some means of
                            satisfying the Turks and (3) British sovereignty over base areas to be
                            retained permanently following self-determination.</p>
                        <p>Skouras transmitted this to <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> and obtained the following reply:</p>
                        <p>Greece believes a solution would be possible if the British (1) clearly
                            recognized self-determination, (2) agreed to a plebiscite within eight
                            years (date to be determined by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            considering the international situation), (3) returned <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in time to sign agreement,
                            (4) retained only Foreign Affairs and Defense during the period of
                            self-government and granted a progressive amnesty.</p>
                        <p>If the plebiscite favored union with Greece, Turkish interests (according
                            to the Greeks) could be secured by (1) a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> limit on Greek forces on Cyprus, (2) creation of a
                            free port to protect Turkish trade, (3) Turkish civil rights to be
                            protected by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In reporting the above to the British Ambassador to Athens, Skouras put
                            in the suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            could be returned to London instead of to Cyprus.</p>

                                    a.m., during a conversation with the President,
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> raised the subject of Cyprus. A
                                    memorandum of the discussion reads:</p>
                                <p>“In connection with the attitude of Greece, I spoke of the Cyprus
                                    matter and said that there was a recommendation to me that the
                                    US should try to get into the solution of the Cyprus problem and
                                    take some initiative and offer its good offices to the three
                                    principal parties. The President said this was all right if we
                                    had what we thought was an answer. However, we should not get in
                                    unless we had some pretty clear <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                        >idea</gloss> as to where we could come out.” (Eisenhower

                            I attach a paper setting forth our intermediate and eventual goals in
                            the Cyprus question and the steps we think we should take to reach
                            them.</p>
                        <p>We believe the controversy is now at a point where the disputants are
                            unlikely to come to any settlement unless they have outside help. If you
                            agree, I feel strongly that <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Julius

                            <p>I recommend that we take the initiative in an attempt to bring about
                                an early settlement of the dispute over Cyprus. It is not likely
                                that the disputants will be able to reach an agreement without
                                outside help, and if a solution is not found the damage to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance and to the
                                British position in the Middle East will be very great. There is
                                every advantage in finding a solution before the next General

                                    a Committee of Three on Non-Military Cooperation was established
                                    to advise the Council on ways to improve and promote cooperation

                                as a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> settlement, it will go
                                far toward meeting the universal expectancy that some striking
                                result will emerge following the creation of the special Committee
                                of Three Foreign Ministers. Such an important, tangible success
                                would give great encouragement and confidence for the future of the
                                coalition. Another beneficial result would be to assure the United
                                Kingdom of a strong military bastion in the Eastern Mediterranean
                                not plagued with local hostility. The British position in the Middle
                                East has been seriously weakened and it is vitally in the interest
                                of the West that it be salvaged and strengthened. If this is not
                                done, the availability of Middle East oil to the UK and Western
                                Europe may be seriously threatened.</p>
                            <p>We should commence by discussing prospects of settlement secretly
                                with the British, and if general agreement is found, subsequently
                                with the Greeks and Turks. The latter will be the most difficult. At
                                some point it would probably be necessary for representatives
                                authorized to speak for the UK and Greece to go secretly to the
                                Seychelles Islands and obtain the approval of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to any agreed solution. I
                                suggest that discussions be begun based on the following:</p>
                            <p>A general election called by the sovereign power, the United Kingdom,
                                should be held, under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                supervision, of a constituent assembly; the Committee of Supervision
                                to consist of from three to five members, not including British,
                                Greek or Turkish representatives. After the election, the
                                constitution would be written and self-government given to the
                                island; the British Governor reserving only control over foreign
                                affairs, defense, and the right to intervene to restore public order
                                in the event of a really serious threat. (If necessary to obtain
                                Greek agreement, this right might be further qualified by making its
                                use dependent on a finding by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1"
                                    >SACEUR</gloss> that the disruption of public order was of such
                                character as to endanger Western defense.) The constitution would
                                include the usual, recognized guarantee for minorities to protect
                                the Turkish population. <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0420"
                                />Additional protection and assurance to the Turkish Government
                                could be given by provision in the constitution which would accord
                                the minority in the legislative assembly the right to appeal against
                                certain categories of legislation, the broad definition of which
                                would be any act which discriminated against the minority. I believe
                                it is possible for qualified constitutional lawyers to produce
                                definitions of such legislation. As it is probably not feasible to
                                create a Supreme Court with power to pass on the constitutionality
                                of legislative acts, a substitute could be found in a panel of
                                eminent jurists named by each of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> powers. A prescribed number of these jurists would
                                be empowered to give a binding decision on the appeal. A petition
                                signed by a pre-determined percentage of members of the legislature,
                                calculated to represent a majority of the number of Turkish
                                representatives, would constitute a judicial appeal.</p>
                            <p>It would be agreed that this period of self-government would run for
                                ten years during which time there would be no change in the
                                international status of the Island. At the end of the ten year
                                period, a plebiscite would be held, again supervised by <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, under which the population of
                                Cyprus would have the right to vote for: (1) union with Greece; (2)
                                local autonomy under the Greek crown; (3) full independence; or (4)
                                a self-governing status under British sovereignty, all to continue
                                minority guarantees. …</p>
                            <p>The British would agree to concentrate their military establishments
                                in a given area which I believe they are already doing, including
                                adequate port facilities. This area would continue to remain under
                                British sovereignty regardless of the outcome of the plebiscite. As
                                these bases would be sovereign British territory, it would be
                                understood that the UK would make arrangements for joint use of any
                                facility with any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nation. In
                                return for the specific recognition by the British of the right of
                                self-determination, the Greeks would agree that even in the event
                                the plebiscite resulted in union with Greece, Greek armed forces on
                                the Island would be limited to police. They would agree not to
                                fortify or to send troops except at the request of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council or on agreement by the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council.</p>
                            <p>The entire settlement would be guaranteed by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers. This would have to be
                                done by individual governments—we should have to go to the
                                Senate—but the guarantee should be made to appear to be a collective
                                action in so far as possible. It might also be found necessary to
                                include the island in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                area, although this is not likely.</p>
                            <p>A further protection for the Turkish minority might be provided by a
                                Tripartite treaty among Great Britain, Greece and Turkey.</p>
                            <p>The general settlement would also have to include arrangements for

                                advisable for the British to agree to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                    >Makarios</persName>’s return to Cyprus.</p>
                            <p>Domestic political pressures impel the British and Greek Governments
                                to seek a genuine solution. On the other hand domestic political
                                pressures impel the Turkish Government to oppose any solution. It is
                                strongly committed to the continuance of the British presence on
                                Cyprus, failing which it claims the Island should revert to Turkey.
                                In the troubled domestic political and economic situation in Turkey,
                                this is the one subject on which all elements agree. The Turks
                                object to another Greek island so close to their coast and to Greek
                                domination of the Turkish minority on Cyprus. They claim that the
                                Treaty of Lausanne created a balanced pattern for the Eastern
                                Mediterranean which should not be disturbed. They insist on a
                                “maintenance of the status quo”. They are stubborn.</p>
                            <p>However, they are also realists and will probably accept a changing
                                situation if they realize it is inevitable. When it appeared that
                                the <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName>–<persName
                                    corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> talks might succeed last
                                winter, their attitude was described by the British Ambassador at
                                Ankara as “grudging acceptance of a fait accompli”.</p>
                            <p>Before a plan is proposed to the Turks, a concerted effort should be
                                made to convince them that we consider they have a legitimate, but
                                not decisive, interest in the evolving political situation on
                                Cyprus. This interest is based on geography and the Turkish
                                minority, not on the Treaty of Lausanne. We consider it unrealistic
                                to talk of maintaining the status quo. The Island has already
                                changed in two years from a peaceful British Colony to a place where
                                18,000 British troops are having difficulty in keeping order.
                                British public opinion will not indefinitely support the use of so
                                many troops for this purpose and therefore the situation will
                                inevitably continue to change. We fully support the British
                                intention of maintaining troops on the Island and share the British
                                belief that to restore stability the population must be allowed,
                                under British and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> supervision,
                                to work out its own political problems. If this evolution is
                                encouraged to proceed peacefully, we believe that tensions on the
                                Island will decrease .… It could also be pointed out that the
                                extensive Turkish minority in Metropolitan Greece has been well
                                treated by the Greek authorities.</p>
                            <p>If the Turks make a point of the Treaty of Lausanne, we will have to
                                make clear that this Treaty simply recognized British sovereignty
                                over Cyprus which had existed de facto since it was annexed by the
                                British on November 5, 1914. We consider that Lausanne <pb n="392"
                                    xml:id="pg_392" facs="0422"/>gave the British complete
                                sovereignty including the right to make any changes in its status
                                which it may wish.</p>

                            heaped upon Greece and to abandon Cyprus cause. This he excluded. The
                            other would be to “fight back” and to accept support from any quarter.
                            He was now weighing his second line of policy.</p>
                        <p>Noting that British had sought absolutely no contact with him since
                            February elections and that he was completely in dark re their
                            intentions, and that he is definitely not threatening to turn toward
                            Russia, he stated that it was only natural that he should turn to US
                            Government for help and protection. What is US point of view on how
                            solution can be found, and what is US willing to do about it? He wished
                            me convey to my government his request that US undertake role of
                            mediation between Greece–UK on Cyprus. Could he have an answer within
                            one week? What ever nature of reply or even if no reply forthcoming, he
                            had within next week or ten days to make fundamental decisions re his
                            future course.</p>
                        <p>In replying to <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> I
                            reviewed many occasions on which US active interest Cyprus question had
                            been manifested and assured him our efforts were not at an end. He
                            asserted belief we have failed influence British and expressed doubt
                            latter wanted solution. This led to discussion in which I stressed
                            damage done to Greek position by <gloss target="#t_EOKA1">EOKA</gloss>
                            terrorism and Athens radio broadcasts. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> categorically denied that his government in
                            any way involved in <gloss target="#t_EOKA1">EOKA</gloss> violence.
                            Wherever responsibility for violence might be, it was resorted to
                            because British refused give democratic self-government to Cypriot
                            people. Where was Radcliffe’s famous constitution? If British really
                            intend to give self-government to Cyprus, why have they taken so long to
                            produce this document? Its publication would prove British bona fides in
                            an instant. Instead they offer life sentences and concentration
                            camps.</p>
                        <p>Key to problem is liberal constitution and amnesty. Self-determination
                            can be postponed indefinitely and be worked out over years between
                            Cypriots and British or by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            Cypriot people may in end not wish sever British tie for economic and
                            other reasons. Perhaps they will decide for independence in
                            Commonwealth, …. There is impressive range of solutions and Greek
                            position not inflexible. But only political solution will stop violence
                            and further deterioration in Greek-allied relations.</p>

                                    do what we can in the endeavor to find a solution. We recognize

                            development of the Cyprus question as affecting the United States and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and to assess whether there is

                        <p>The United States as the leader of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            is witnessing a dispute which for a year has made real cooperation
                            between two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members and a third
                            member impossible. It has weakened <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            internally and has also weakened outside respect for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a cohesive group.</p>
                        <p>The differing positions of the three members have become so hardened by
                            mutual mistrust and by mutual public condemnation that agreement is
                            unlikely without outside assistance. Certainly the history of the Cyprus
                            question for the past two and a half years shows steady deterioration. A
                            permanent improvement is unlikely unless these countries are helped to
                            reestablish contact, discussion and some understanding. For the past
                            year there have been no useful discussions between Greece and the United
                            Kingdom or Turkey. Even if the British are now able to restore order and
                            to offer a fair constitution, it is unlikely that the Cypriots would
                            accept it without considerable encouragement from Greece. Greece and
                            Turkey almost certainly cannot extricate themselves from their present
                            public positions and assume more useful roles in finding a solution
                            without an active display of American interest. All this would be
                            worsened by a third and more vehement quarrel in the U.N. General
                            Assembly.</p>

                        <p>Thus the Cyprus situation will almost certainly not be improved unless

                            assumes a more <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0429"/>active role in
                            bringing its allies together. The following considerations would bear
                            upon the decision as to what the United States might do: <list>

                                <item>Both the British and Greek Governments are under pressure to

                                <item>The Turkish position has hardened since the United States has
                                    been less active in recent months and as the Greek attitude has
                                    become more flexible. Turkish realism would probably dictate a
                                    less intransigent attitude if faced by joint US-UK proposals for
                                    a reasonable settlement which would take into account Turkish
                                    interest in and sensitivity over the matter.</item>

                                    this relatively small island should be settled could probably be
                                    turned to good account.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Experience has demonstrated that the mere dispatch of messages to the
                            several parties in the dispute is not an effective means of dealing with
                            the matter. It is also clear that a meeting of the three powers would
                            probably be counterproductive and would lead to highly publicized
                            intemperate oratory. It would seem in the circumstance that the United
                            States should designate an experienced officer to go to London, Athens
                            and Ankara to have talks quietly and informally.</p>
                        <p>This officer should seek to find and widen such common ground as may form
                            the basis for a solution. He should report on his findings before
                            committing U.S. prestige to any major understandings. He should avoid
                            publicity and for this purpose a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            cover might be useful.</p>
                        <p>The officer will see that the two main focuses of dispute have been (a)
                            the Greek and Cypriot demand for immediate self-government for the
                            island and (b) the Greek and Cypriot desire for self-determination.
                            (There is little real dissension on continued use of British bases.) Of
                            the two, the issue of self-determination is the more difficult since the
                            Turkish Government has taken a strong stand against it. On the other
                            hand, the British Prime Minister has publicly recognized that the
                            principle of self-determination is applicable to Cyprus under certain
                            circumstances. Our own position is defined by the President’s letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> (Tab A<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d192fn2">Not found attached, but printed as <ref
                                    target="#d161">Document 161</ref>.</note>) stating that “the
                            basic right of peoples to governments of their own choice” (Joint
                            Declaration of Washington) is applicable to Cyprus. The Greek
                            Government, moreover, has indicated its willingness to put settlement of
                            this matter aside for ultimate disposition by the British and Cypriots
                            or by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It may be possible with
                            U.S. assistance <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0430"/>to reduce to
                            manageable proportions the emotions involved in the self-determination
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>On the issue of self-government, our negotiator will find considerable
                            common ground. The U.K. already has asked Lord Radcliffe to draft a
                            constitution. The Greek Prime Minister has said that requirements for a
                            solution are a liberal constitution and amnesty for the revolutionaries.
                            If the British can expedite the promulgation of a liberal constitution
                            with a minimum of power reserved to the British Governor, our
                            representative may find that the Greeks can be persuaded to accept such
                            a solution. The Greeks, moreover, may come to see that the gap between a
                            full measure of self-government and self-determination is not great. As
                            for the Cypriots, there is reason to believe that Greek influence over
                            the Cyprus Ethnarchy may now be sufficient to obtain acceptance and to
                            bring an end to the current violence. The Turks, we believe, should be
                            urged by us to agree on at least two important grounds: (a) that
                            self-government has now become a cardinal principle of British colonial
                            policy, from which there should be no exception in the case of Cyprus;
                            and (b) that self-government is a right that can hardly be denied in the
                            free world which the Atlantic Community protects. It must, of course, be
                            recognized that Turkish agreement regarding self-government would depend
                            upon the nature of the protection afforded to the Turkish minority.</p>

                                    >Document 191</ref>.</note> I had long conversation today with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> and set forth
                            U.S. concern at deterioration Greek Government position, referred to
                            reports of recent conversations of Greeks with our Embassy Athens in
                            which Greeks appeared prepared to take more reasonable attitude than
                            heretofore with regard to Cyprus and emphasized our feeling that any
                            opportunity to capitalize on such Greek conciliatory attitude toward
                            solution of Cyprus problem should in our view be seized upon. I informed
                            him that Greeks sent message to Secretary asking U.S. “mediation” but
                            that U.S. has no present plan to accede to such request. I summarized
                            substance Acting Secretary’s response, specifically our expression
                            gratification at attitude Greek Government reflected in current
                            proposals they have made to U.S. which I noted are largely consistent
                            with British position as set forth to me by <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName> on various occasions….Regarding Cyprus I
                            inquired extent of British current contact with Greek Government and
                            whether British have any plans to take advantage present atmosphere to
                            confer with Greeks specifically in regard to steps toward
                            self-government on island.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> …. confirmed that
                            reports reaching British from Greek sources, including those from
                            British Embassy Athens, suggest that Greek Government is currently
                            taking line that it is prepared to support more reasonable arrangement
                            for self-government than heretofore and not to insist on implementation
                            of self-determination at this time…. practical steps would be either for
                            Greeks to make their position public or at least to make known their
                            attitude to Ethnarchy and Greek Cypriots. At present he said there is
                            every evidence that Greek Government is continuing to take contrary line
                            publicly and with Greek Cypriots. I suggested it might be difficult for
                            Government of Greece to take public line until they are aware of whole
                            nature of self-government package which is to be presented to Greek
                            Cypriots but that it seemed to us that British might well explore
                            possibilities more directly and more specifically with Greek Government
                            now on basis of current indications of its attitude. I asked whether
                            British have any intention of discussing with Greek Government Lord
                            Radcliffe’s proposals for constitution. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName>
                            <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0432"/>replied in negative.
                            Radcliffe’s plan is to proceed to Cyprus second time within next 2 weeks
                            and to endeavor to discuss his concepts with Greek Cypriots and other
                            elements on island. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName>
                            said he would hope that if Greek Government’s attitude is genuine it
                            might be possible for that government to facilitate such discussions
                            rather than as at present letting it be known on island that Greeks
                            coming forward for such discussions are traitors to Greek cause.</p>

                        <p>…<persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> emphasized that
                            British have not made any decision to go to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. They are apparently concerned at possibility <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration would give Soviets
                            undesirable opportunity to raise issues regarding Malaya and other
                            empire areas. I reiterated United States concern that if Cyprus is taken
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, United States and United Kingdom
                            may find themselves separated on colonial aspects of problem, and
                            inquired how British would envisage presenting case to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in such fashion as to contribute to
                            solution rather than as purely negative commendatory action.</p>
                        <p>Specifically I asked whether British would envisage seeking resolution
                            favoring self-government. He doubted British would be prepared to go
                            that far and again stated that no decision has been taken and matter
                            still under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Conversation then turned to extent British current contact with Greek
                            Government which I had mentioned earlier. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName> said Embassy Athens has relatively normal
                            contact and that there is some indication that Greeks are considering
                            re-establishing Ambassador in London. He noted Greek opposition circles
                            have been criticizing government on grounds that its views on Cyprus are
                            now largely represented in London by British Parliamentary opposition
                            elements and urging that Greek Ambassador return to London. I again took
                            occasion to emphasize United States conviction that, whatever reasons
                            for apparent more conciliatory attitude Greek Government and even if
                            attitude is more apparent than real, interest of all dictate every
                            effort be made to take all possible steps to ensure that no opportunity
                            is overlooked to advance Cyprus problem toward solution. While I am not
                            wholly sanguine that British disposed move ahead this matter as fast as
                            we would like and while it is obvious that Suez developments have an
                            impact on British thinking tending to make them even more cautious in
                            taking any steps which would prejudice firmness of their control over
                            Cyprus base at this time, it is my view that they are in fact steadily
                            moving toward some sort of realistic constitution for island and that
                            Lord Radcliffe’s efforts in that direction are being expedited.
                            Subsequent to drafting the foregoing, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> told me at lunch today that <persName

                            agreed Greeks appear more conciliatory this moment and, although noting
                            Cyprus problem not of importance Suez, professed concur my view that no
                            opportunity should be lost to move toward solution and that critical
                            situation regarding Suez itself makes progress in Cyprus issue more
                            necessary. Have just received <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>

                            Greek proposals as set forth to us, specifically (1) reaffirmation of
                            British acceptance principle self determination at appropriate time
                            which seemed to be covered by <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1"
                                >Harding</persName>’s broadcast; (2) reservation to British of
                            police powers for some period in addition to indefinite continuance
                            defense and foreign affairs in British hands to reassure British and
                            Turks that self government is not step on slippery slope to enosis, and
                            (3) bi-cameral parliament with upper house having veto over minority
                            rights, education, religion, etc. I indicated this position seemed
                            generally close to line British have been taking for some time. As
                            indicated above <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName>’s
                            response was to effect that Greek professions in this direction would be
                            more valuable and could be taken more seriously if they were prepared to
                            state this position publicly or effectively to Greek Cypriots.</p>

                        <p>On September 6, during the course of a discussion with the President,
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> raised the problem of Cyprus. According
                            to the memorandum of conversation, the following exchange occurred:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I discussed the Cyprus matter with the President along the line
                                    of the recommendation to me of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                        >Rountree</persName> of September 4, 1956. I referred to the
                                    prior talk I had had with the President when he said that before
                                    we got in we should have some <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                        >idea</gloss> where we might perhaps come out. I said it
                                    seemed the Greeks might now be willing to settle on a basis
                                    which would deal with self-government <pb n="405"
                                        xml:id="pg_405" facs="0435"/>but leave at status quo the
                                    question of self-determination. If so, this might provide a
                                    basis for settlement. Certainly the present Government was the
                                    best one to deal with and unless something could be worked out
                                    with it it might fall and a government with considerable
                                    Communist influence take its place.</p>
                                <p>“… The President agreed that under the circumstances it would be
                                    in order to proceed. I said I assumed we would talk first with
                                    the British and not go further unless they were acquiescent. I
                                    said the recommendation was that <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                        >Julius Holmes</persName> be asked to take this. The
                                    President thought he would be a good negotiator for the
                                    purpose.” (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, Meetings with the

                        <p>Mr. Skouras had two purposes in calling on the Secretary: First, he gave
                            the Secretary a brief review of his travels this summer. During these
                            travels he had called first on the British Prime Minister and the
                            British Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>On June 20th Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            hinted to Skouras that the British had a plan which would lead to
                            eventual self-determination. This referred to the British proposals
                            which were submitted to the Secretary on June 19th.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d196fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Documents 178</ref> and
                                    <ref target="#d179">179</ref>.</note> Skouras said that later
                            these plans had appeared in the British press and that there had been a
                            strong Turkish reaction against them. Next Mr. Skouras saw Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> and Foreign
                            Minister Averoff in Athens on about July 5th. He gathered from them that
                            the Greek Government felt heavily burdened by the Cyprus question and
                            was looking for any reasonable solution which would permit them to save
                            face and not be weighed down with this problem. Finally he saw Mr.
                                <persName>Koraltan</persName>, President of the Turkish Parliament.
                            He explained to Mr. Koraltan the Greek proposals as contained in Athens
                            Embassy Despatch No. 66.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">Not printed, but
                                see <ref target="#d191fn5">footnote 5, Document 191</ref>.</note> He
                            said that Mr. Koraltan was interested. Mr. Skouras was <pb n="406"
                                xml:id="pg_406" facs="0436"/>unable to see Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> or President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC1">Bayar</persName> and admitted that the Turkish
                            attitude was extremely stiff. He attempted to show them that good
                            relations between Greece and Turkey were infinitely more important than
                            the Cyprus question and urged that the Greeks and Turks should try to
                            work this problem out between them. This suggestion does not appear to
                            have been taken up.</p>
                        <p>The second point in Mr. <persName>Skouras</persName>’ discussion was that
                            as a result of his trip he had become convinced that the only way in
                            which the Cyprus question could be solved would be to give the island
                            Commonwealth status. He realized that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> felt Cyprus was too small to be a Commonwealth, but he
                            felt this consideration should not be conclusive. He pointed out that if
                            Cyprus were given Commonwealth status within the British Commonwealth of
                            Nations Turkey could not reasonably object and he was sure that the
                            Greek Government would accept. He also claimed that the Cypriots would
                            accept. He said this latter belief was based on what Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> had told him. It
                            was pointed out to Mr. Skouras that if Cyprus were to be given
                            Commonwealth status it would have the right to leave the Commonwealth
                            and that in effect this might be the same as eventual enosis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Skouras</persName> said that he would submit a full report
                            to the Secretary later.<note n="4" xml:id="d196fn4">In a letter to
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName>, September 14, Skouras forwarded a

                                submitted to the President. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            received from the United States. Now the question had again been
                            inscribed by Greece and there was considerable risk that there would be
                            a damaging debate. However, if the United States were able to give
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> the same support as last year,
                            it might be possible to avoid a debate. On the other hand, if this was
                            not to be the US position, the debate might result in a diplomatic
                            defeat for <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>. To avoid this <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> might put an item of its own on the
                            Agenda to show Greece’s role in the Cyprus question. <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had not yet decided but, if it were to
                            inscribe such an item, it would have to do so by October 12 and would
                            have to make its decision about ten days before October 12. Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> realized this was
                            difficult for the United States, but it was important for <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to know since the American attitude
                            would be decisive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that there had been a big change in the
                            composition of the General Assembly which would probably result in
                            increased support for Greece. Miss <persName corresp="#p_SB1"
                                >Salt</persName> agreed, although <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> had not analyzed the situation in detail. The Secretary
                            asked if the Department had analyzed the question of our ability to
                            prevent inscription and was told this had not been done. He pointed out
                            to Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> that the item could
                            be submitted after October 12 as a matter of urgency and emphasized that
                            this had been done a good many times before. Miss <persName
                                corresp="#p_SB1">Salt</persName> replied <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> was thinking in terms of an indictment of the Greek
                            Government for inciting violence on Cyprus by Athens Radio and by other
                            means, which had occurred over a long period. It would thus be difficult
                            to maintain that an emergency had arisen after October 12. The Secretary
                            asked if the item could not be inscribed now in general terms. Miss
                                <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Salt</persName>
                            <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0438"/>replied that, in view of

                            have to be aimed specifically at Greece.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could not now say what our position would be.
                            Generally, our basic view on inscription was pretty liberal and last
                            year’s decision to oppose inscription had been difficult; also, there
                            was the practical question of how many members of the General Assembly
                            could be persuaded. He said the Department would analyze the situation
                            in terms of the chances of keeping the question off the Agenda. Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Roger</persName> asked if he could
                            receive an answer in a week or so. The Secretary said within a week he
                            could probably go over with him our analysis of the situation as
                            compared with that of the Foreign Office…. There might possibly be some
                            developments in the solution of the question itself….<note n="3"

                            and then raised question of whether in light of Suez situation, Her

                            was considered in British interest to hold line on island and proceed in
                            unhurried <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0439"/>manner with Radcliffe
                            constitution. There was no direct answer to this question, which
                            probably indicates that relation Cyprus and Suez had not been thought
                            through.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> mentioned British query to

                            on provisional agenda General Assembly. It was explained that one
                            objective our suggested informal examination of situation was to
                            determine U.S. position in U.N. Speaking direct to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said he thought it essential that British
                            complaint against Greece should be inscribed before final date of
                            provisional agenda October 12. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LBA1"
                                >Lennox-Boyd</persName> seemed to agree and although British may
                            delay until near deadline, there seems no doubt they will submit their
                            complaint. They feel their case against Greece is a strong one and that
                            there is a possibility that its inscription may result in a negotiated
                            removal of it and the Greek item or the postponement of both to the tail
                            end of the agenda.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LBA1">Lennox-Boyd</persName> reported that
                            Radcliffe had departed for Cyprus and would return in about a week. He
                            expected that within 4 or 5 weeks from now Radcliffe would submit his
                            draft constitution to Her Majesty’s Government. If the government
                            approved the draft, he was willing to show it to the Greek Government
                            before promulgation. In response to questions, he stated that personally
                            he would be willing to accept Greek comments, and if there was real
                            evidence of good faith by Greece, he would be willing to allow
                            non-substantive changes if by so doing Greece’s ability to influence the
                            Ethnarchy would be strengthened. Although he could not predict what
                            Radcliffe’s recommendations would be, he felt certain that his draft
                            constitution would be a truly liberal one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LBA1">Lennox-Boyd</persName> then volunteered his
                            position with respect to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName>: it was never intended that the exile would be
                            permanent; if the Archbishop would denounce terrorism now and for the
                            future, he would be allowed to return to Cyprus, but only after the new
                            constitution was in force and working; if even after constitution in
                            force and working, he still failed to denounce terrorism he would
                            nevertheless be released, free to go where he chose, except he would be
                            barred from Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Colonial Secretary then said he saw some possibility of a settlement
                            if Greece would completely separate self-government and
                            self-determination, settling now for the former, and if Turks could be
                            convinced that self-government was not an open door to
                            self-determination and that minority really protected.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> pointed out that from what
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> and Averoff have
                            told our representatives in Athens, the appeal to the U.S. to mediate
                            remarks by Averoff to Committee of 3 in Paris and to Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GWF1">George</persName> and him, it was our opinion that
                            Greek Government <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0440"/>is very
                            anxious for settlement, fears its political position and feels that when
                            circumstances right it can influence Cypriots. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCBP1">Peake</persName> opinioned that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> is in no great danger of
                            being ousted and that talk of losing power and painting black picture of
                            what might succeed him was designed to “make our flesh creep”. No one
                            expressed agreement with this view.</p>
                        <p>There then followed general discussion of how Greek sincerity and
                            influence with Cypriots might be tested. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName> suggested that they might be asked to send
                            word secretly to Bishop of Kitium that leading Cypriots respond to
                            Radcliffe’s invitation to consult on constitution.</p>
                        <p>The meeting lasted an hour and of course there was much more general
                            conversation of the complex subject under discussion. It ended with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> saying that they
                            would discuss the matter, think it over and communicate with us as soon
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was cordial, serious and our desire to be helpful was clearly
                            appreciated. <note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">In telegram 1254, October 5,

                                officers only, the Department made a number of comments on telegram
                                1692 that were intended for possible use in discussions with the
                                British. Among its comments, the Department noted that if the United
                                Kingdom was determined to inscribe the item regarding Greece’s
                                intervention in the Cyprus problem, it might be best to make the
                                item of a general character without naming Greece. With respect to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, the Department
                                added, any proposals must be ultimately acceptable to the Greek

                                    weakened by time and since composition of General Assembly has
                                    been considerably changed, we do not believe we could attain
                                    same result if attempted. Our preliminary analysis shows that if

                                    against UK by narrow margin. Would appreciate British

                        <p>Greeks appear to have intimation that Radcliffe constitution will be

                            that after a stated period (three years was suggested) discussions take

                            for gradual turn-over of police power to Cypriots with British to retain

                                >Harding</persName> terms, he replied that best solution would be
                            simple blanket amnesty for all concerned. He indicated willingness,
                            however, give further consideration matter which he <pb n="414"

                        <p>In conversations Greeks showed no apparent awareness of British intention
                            to inscribe complaint against them in UNGA. They fully cognizant,
                            however, that in UNGA debate British will attack them vigorously and
                            would like to avoid it if at all possible. Unless solution can be found
                            within next two or three weeks, however, Greek Government feels impelled

                            understood Turks have to be taken into account and expressed desire
                            improve Greek-Turkish relations. He felt that if substantial Anglo-Greek
                            agreement achieved, Turks would make necessary adjustments in their

                        <p>At end second session with <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>, Averoff joined us and there was brief
                            discussion of tactics and procedures. Greeks stressed need to avoid
                            unilateral announcement by British of any settlement and strongly
                            advocated simultaneous announcements in both capitals. They again placed
                            great weight on need for consultation concerning Radcliffe

                        <p>Just prior Averoff’s entry on scene, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName>, bearing in mind need bring Averoff’s helpful
                            influence to bear, had obtained Prime Minister’s consent to procedure
                            under which we would draw up brief summary of Greek Government position
                            (with view of showing it to British) and to going over this paper first
                            with Foreign Minister. Objective this procedure to reconcile differences
                            between positions of two Ministers and to obtain a clear and agreed
                            statement of Greek position without asking for formal commitments this
                            time. Text paper will be cabled Washington when it takes final form
                            after it has been reviewed by Averoff and a probable last going over

                            thought that this year would probably not be possible.</p>
                        <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed and said that it looked as though that would be the
                            case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said that if
                            the battle for inscription were lost this would hamper the prospects for
                            peace. Therefore, the UK intended to put forward a counter-item, which
                            would be directed against the Greek broadcasts and Greek help to
                            terrorists. He said that while the UK did not want “a public wrangle” on
                            the subject, he hoped that each item would cancel the other out and that
                            this would discourage the Greek Government from pressing its item. The
                            title of the item the UK had in mind was “Support from Greece for
                            terrorism in Cyprus”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> questioned this
                            title which suggested that the Greek Government was being indicted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested something like “Support from <hi rend="italic"
                                >Greeks</hi> of terrorist activities in Cyprus”. He said that the US
                            is satisfied that the present <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> government is sick to death of the Cyprus
                            business. At the same time it is subject to pressure by Greek public
                            opinion. He did not exclude the possibility that something might be
                            worked out between now and the time at which the General Assembly
                            convened which might lead to a settlement. But if an item were inscribed
                            under an inflammatory title it would place the Greek Government in a
                            position vis-à-vis Greek public opinion where the Greek Government would
                            have no freedom of action. He, therefore, hoped that the UK would find a
                            title which would not inflame them. He understood the reasons why the UK
                            might feel compelled to put forward a counter-item but suggested that if
                            they had to do so it might be something like “Support from without
                            Greece of illegal activities within Cyprus”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> questioned whether the
                            US was psychologically right in its estimate of the situation. He
                            thought that perhaps the prospects for a settlement would be improved if
                            we seemed prepared “to beat Greeks over the head”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that it was our view that the present Greek
                            Government is sick of the whole Cyprus business and was groping
                            desperately to find a way to settle matters. … He questioned the
                            advisability of publicly appearing to challenge a government’s integrity
                            and honor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> said he was inclined
                            to agree and suggested another variant: “Support from overseas of
                            terrorism in Cyprus”. This, he said, would not be provocative and would
                            leave the Greeks concerned about what might be said. After a little
                            further discussion with his advisors, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> said he would suggest to London the formula:
                            “External support for terrorism in Cyprus”. He added that he would see
                            what support he could get for the above title from London.</p>

                        <p>When it became clear from talk with Averoff yesterday that he was having
                            difficulty in obtaining Prime Minister’s approval of our initial draft,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and I suggested joint
                            meeting with both <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> and
                            Averoff which took place today and lasted more than 3 hours. As agreed,
                            I took strong line at outset that <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> here because of impression gained by Embassy in
                            many meetings with Prime Minister and his Foreign Minister that only
                            small differences existed between positions Greek and British
                            Governments, and that Greek Government was fundamentally prepared to go
                            ahead with self-government now and to postpone application of
                            self-determination principle to indefinite future. If this was not, in
                            fact, Greek position, then <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                            was wasting his time. Latter then stated that in his opinion British
                            would not agree to any proposal which committed them definitely to hold
                            plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>This approach had good effect, and session ended with <persName

                            optimistic (conversation with <persName corresp="#p_IS1"

                            agreement reached, political crisis would be inevitable. If election
                            forced, he was confident <persName corresp="#p_KC1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> raised question whether
                            anything could be done now by Greek Government to improve climate while
                            negotiations proceeding. For example, if return Radcliffe were made
                            occasion for favorable public utterance by British, could Greeks respond
                            by sending their Ambassador to London? Averoff said he had been seeking
                            opportunity do just that but with UNGA imminent it was very difficult
                            for Greek Government to “break vicious circle”. Public suspicion would
                            be aroused that Greek position weakening. This would lead to internal
                            political complications.</p>

                            considered as giving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            veto power over any Anglo-Greek agreement which might be reached.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> said that he thought
                            it might be possible to obtain a longer period than three years from the
                            Greeks if a counter proposal did not depart too radically from the basic
                            formula on self-determination. He went on to say that he had told
                            Averoff that he doubted that the British would accept the proposal
                            concerning consultation with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> as set forth in paragraph 7. A discussion then
                            followed as to the advisability of insisting with the Greeks that if an
                            agreement is reached with them it Will be applicable regardless of the
                            final attitude of the Archbishop.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> then told the British that
                            he had been authorized by Averoff to say that Greeks felt it imperative
                            to go ahead with the inscription of their item on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda, that Averoff had stated he
                            thought they would be successful in obtaining inscription but that he
                            would make a formal commitment that the Greeks would immediately move to
                            place the item at the end of the agenda. Averoff pointed out that this
                            would give 2 or 3 months during which a negotiated solution might be
                            reached. <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> said that the
                            British had definitely decided that they had no alternative but to
                            inscribe their complaints against the Greeks. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> suggested for British
                            consideration that they inform the Greek Minister advance of their
                            intention to inscribe, saying that they understood the Greeks would move
                            to have their item placed at the end of the agenda and that if this were
                            confirmed British would do likewise. <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> appeared to be impressed by this suggestion.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>There were several remarks made about the difficulty of the position
                            which the Turks would likely take particularly on the formula on
                            self-determination but nothing new emerged in this part of the
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>The general reception of the Greek terms was non-committal but was not
                            negative. <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> said that the
                            matter would be considered by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and he

                                <persName>Young</persName> this afternoon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> was profuse in his apologies
                            about delay, saying that he literally had not been able to get the
                            appropriate ministers together to consider the Greek proposal. He also
                            expressed regret that the reply was so negative in character.</p>
                        <p>He handed over a memorandum, the text of which is being transmitted in
                            the next following telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Telegram 2281,
                                October 25, transmitted the text of the British rejection of the
                                Greek proposals, which noted that the proposals did not “form a
                                realistic basis for a settlement.”(<hi rend="italic"
                                >Ibid.</hi>)</note> It was interesting to note that the copy handed
                                <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> had as a heading the
                            following: “revised formula for reply to Mister Juliett Holmes”, while
                            the original did not bear this heading.</p>
                        <p>After reading the memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> observed that the 3-year period proposed by the
                            Greeks, as compared with the 10-year period in <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss>’s proposals of last June, was obviously a starting
                            point by the Greeks and was certainly susceptible of negotiation. He
                            also took issue with the statement that the Greek proposal did not take
                            into account British continuing interest in Cyprus and the <pb n="421"
                                xml:id="pg_421" facs="0451"/>eastern Mediterranean or of Turkish
                            interests. Clarification was asked on these and other points in the
                            text, but none was forthcoming. <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said at this point that the Greek proposals were
                            also less favorable than the British plan of last June in that they did
                            not contain the security pacts. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> observed that he had no reason to believe that
                            the Greeks would not be willing to accept such pacts.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Barbour</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> tried repeatedly to get over the
                            point that it might be worthwhile for the British to make a
                            counterproposal which would be acceptable to them and which would be as
                            nearly acceptable to the Turks as possible. These suggestions met with
                            no response.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> made a great deal of the
                            known adamant attitude of the Turks, bringing out a memorandum of
                            conversation between <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> shortly after the
                            conclusion of the last Suez conference in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> recited the well-known Turkish
                            opposition to any change in the status quo.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> indicated that it was a
                            substantially firm decision by <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> that
                            they would go ahead with the Radcliffe constitution, saying that it was
                            better to take one step at a time. He felt certain that the truly
                            liberal constitution which would be developed would be unsatisfactory to
                            the Turks and they expected a serious disagreement with them about it.
                            In response to a question, <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> said that Radcliffe would probably submit this
                            report and draft constitution to the government within about 10 days
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> then asked whether
                            or not it was the intention of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to
                            consult with the Greeks and Turks or at least to show them the
                            constitution before its promulgation. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> suggested the possibility that prior consultation
                            with the Greeks might win their support for the constitution, and
                            through them it might even be possible to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>’ approval and hence
                            contribute to the cessation of terrorism and the acceptance of the
                            constitution by the Cyprus population. <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> replied that no decision had been made on the
                            question of consultation but gave it as his personal opinion that it
                            would probably be better to promulgate the constitution unilaterally,
                            possibly with showing the text to the Greeks and the Turks an hour in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>It was clear that the British have decided not to attempt a negotiated
                            solution at the present time but on the contrary intend to proceed
                            unilaterally. Presumably they believe that by the publication of a
                            liberal constitution their public position will be improved.</p>
                        <p>There followed some discussion about the inscription of the Greek and
                            British items on the agenda of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            and in response to a direct question, <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> replied that although the Greeks had been
                            notified in advance of the British intention to inscribe, there had been
                            no understanding with them to postpone both items to the end of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Agenda. He said that although
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had not yet decided <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0452"/>on the position it would take, he felt
                            that it might prove to be advantageous to have the debate early in the
                            General Assembly. To <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> query
                            as to whether or not this meant that the British had given up any hope
                            of a negotiated settlement, <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1"
                                >Nutting</persName> replied that even if the debate occurred at the
                            end of the session, the time available would be only 3 months and he
                            doubted that there was any chance of getting a settlement in that period
                            of time.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the attitude described above is a part of the current
                            British mood of self-assertion in anything having to do with the Middle
                            East. As has been shown in the Suez matter, they have taken the position
                            of “thus far and no farther”. All arguments tending to show the
                            advantages of an agreed settlement met with no success.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> whether or not he intended to go
                            to Ankara for talks with the Turks. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> replied that he was not inclined to discuss the
                            Greek proposals with the Turks in the light of the flat British
                            rejection of them. He felt that it might be worthwhile to make a general
                            sounding of the Turkish position, that he would decide about this later
                            and let <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> know whether or
                            not he intended to go to Ankara.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> feels that it would
                            nevertheless be desirable to discuss these developments generally with
                            Turks. If any appreciable give in Turkish attitude should be
                            forthcoming, we would be justified in going back at British in view of
                            importance for British position they have represented as attaching to
                            Turkish adamancy. Another reason for doing this is the fact that
                            according to report from Embassy Ankara, <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1"
                                >Birgi</persName> has a good <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss>
                            of <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> omission and it not be
                            in US interests to fail to consult with the third principal party to the
                            Cyprus controversy. Unless instructed by the Department to the contrary,

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> explained mission and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> response was
                            immediate and cordial, saying that it was understandable that the “head
                            of the family should take the initiative in settling a family row”. He
                            went on to say that Turkey was anxious to bring the Cyprus dispute to a
                            successful conclusion and, although Turkey’s interests in the problem
                            were vital and that the issue had become one of first importance in
                            terms of internal politics, Turkey, nevertheless, was prepared to do
                            everything possible to contribute to a solution. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> confirmed reports from Athens
                            that Hacopulos, a Greek member of the Turkish Parliament, was acting as
                            go-between in an endeavor to get Prime Ministers of Turkey and Greece
                            together in hopes of making progress on Cyprus and improving relations
                            in general. He said that Hacopulos was in Ankara and was to depart
                            November 3 for Athens to transmit agreement for meeting. Prime <pb
                                n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0454"/>Minister said that it would not
                            be possible for him and <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            to meet without publicity but that arrangements would probably be made
                            for Etem <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>, Acting Foreign
                            Minister, to meet Averoff, possibly some place in Europe on latter’s
                            return from UNGA. He went on to say that it might later be decided for
                            Etem <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> to attend <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, in which case he and Averoff would have
                            ample opportunity for discussion in New York. Prime Minister intimated
                            that this exchange with Greeks was on Turkish initiative and pointed to
                            this fact as evidence Turkish desires to improve situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> outlined his personal
                            opinion as to present Greek and British attitudes, saying that he was
                            convinced that Greeks were very anxious to dispose of Cyprus matter and
                            prepared to accept any reasonable formula which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> could justify with Greek
                            public opinion. He pointed out that the British were proceeding with
                            Radcliffe constitution and that in his view UK would inevitably be
                            obliged institute self-government Cyprus as soon as local conditions
                            would permit. He offered purely personal suggestion that delay in coming
                            to grips with the problem would benefit no one and that it might be
                            advantageous to assist the present British Government in setting a
                            pattern of self-government, particularly in the light of the public
                            commitment of the British Labor Party to self-determination and the
                            possibility, at least, that should Labor come to power a solution
                            favorable to Turkey might be more difficult of attainment than with the
                            present Conservative government. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> attitude was extremely friendly, including
                            repeated assurances of the importance to Turkey of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance and particularly the
                            relationship with the US. He said he would discuss our conversation with
                            the President and his colleagues, and see us again November 3.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and I were called to the
                            Foreign Office at noon today and had an hour and a half with Acting
                            Foreign Minister Etem <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName>. Much of the
                            conversation of the evening before was repeated with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> acting as interpreter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> went a little further
                            in offering as his own purely exploratory <gloss target="#t_IDEA1"
                                >idea</gloss> of a possible formula which would consist of the UK
                            consulting both Greece and Turkey with regard to the Radcliffe
                            constitution and giving both these governments an opportunity to
                            comment. The purpose of this consultation would be to permit Turkey and
                            Greece to approve the constitution. This would perhaps enable the Greek
                            Government, having once agreed, to persuade <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> to support the self-government plan and to call
                            on the Greek Cypriots for a cessation of violence. The British
                            Government would make a public statement reaffirming the applicability
                            of self-determination to Cyprus but saying that circumstances do not
                            permit its application now; that the problem must be approached in a
                            gradual and orderly manner and the first step would be self-government;
                            that after self-government <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0455"/>had
                            proved a success and when political and strategic conditions in eastern
                            Mediterranean permitted, <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would
                            address itself to the problem of self-determination. This formula would
                            have the virtue of postponing the question of self-determination to the
                            indefinite future but would set the pattern for a period during which
                            self-government could be developed, peace would reign on the island, and
                            an opportunity would be had for a reestablishment of friendly relations
                            between Greece and Turkey and between the UK and Greece.</p>
                        <p>Preceded by a long explanation of the background of Greek behavior and
                            the deterioration of Greco-Turkish relations, wherein all the blame
                            attached to Greece, Etem <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            said that in his view such a formula would not be accepted by Turkish
                            public opinion as it would be construed only as a corridor leading to
                            Enosis.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>After more general discussion, <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> whether or not he agreed that the Cyprus
                            problems should not be allowed to run on and that steps should be taken
                            forthwith to finding a settlement. To this he agreed, which is at least
                            a step away from rigid position of no change in the status quo which the
                            Turks have taken up to now. The Prime Minister’s attitude was more
                            conciliatory and forthcoming than the Foreign Minister’s position today.
                            Whether this balance was introduced by design, it is difficult to say.
                            It may be significant that <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1"
                                >Birgi</persName> was not present at the conversation with Prime
                            Minister but was present with the Foreign Minister. It should be noted
                            that in this last discussion, <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1"
                                >Birgi</persName> acted as interpreter and made little or no
                            contribution of his own to the discussion.</p>
                        <p>The interview ended with an invitation from the Foreign Minister for
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> and me to dine with
                            him and <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> privately evening
                            of November 4. He expressed hope that the Prime Minister could join us.

                                    expressed. We believe that direct US interest in this matter has
                                    influenced them to be somewhat more forthcoming in working
                                    toward settlement.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> described his conversation
                            with Turks and Greeks, particularly former, reporting that although
                            their basic position concerning their contention that any form of
                            self-government was a “corridor to Enosis” had not really changed, he
                            found a less intransigent attitude than they had previously displayed.
                            He told <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> of the
                            arrangement for a secret meeting between Etem <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> and Averoff in Paris on the latter’s return
                            from the UNGA. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> said
                            that about a week ago the Turkish Ambassador had informed him of this
                            arrangement and had made a formal request on behalf of his government
                            that the British not publish the Radcliffe report until after the
                            Greeco-Turkish meeting takes place. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName> had referred this request to Ministers but
                            as yet it had not been considered. When asked concerning <gloss

                                xml:id="pg_427" facs="0457"/>regarding publication Radcliffe report,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> replied that it
                            had not yet been considered by Cabinet and no decision has as yet been
                            made. Upon further questioning, he said that it had not been decided
                            whether or not the Greeks and Turks would be consulted on the
                            constitution prior to publication. <persName corresp="#p_BW1"
                                >Barbour</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> both urged that this be done. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> whether or not he was
                            right in assuming that in fact <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had
                            not put its mind to the Cyprus problem. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1"
                                >Kirkpatrick</persName> replied that this was so, but added that he
                            felt that they mean do so without further delay.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> said that he felt
                            that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would not be inclined toward
                            partition as a solution, or in any event would much prefer
                            self-government. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_HJC2"
                                >Holmes</persName> whether or not in his opinion the Turks could be
                            brought to approve of self-government with the question of
                            self-determination left for the very indefinite future. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> reply was that although it would
                            be difficult to obtain Turkish concurrence, he felt that it was very
                            much worth trying and that if other circumstances were right, strong
                            representations from the United States and United Kingdom might bring
                            the Turks around. <persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName>
                            said that he suspected that the Turks hoped to make some progress in the
                            secret meeting with the Greeks and then proceed to partition as a
                            solution. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                            that it would be useful to get Greeks and Turks talking, and that even
                            consideration of partition as a possible solution might tend to move
                            them both from their present positions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KSIA1">Kirkpatrick</persName> said that as far as
                            he knew <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had not decided on its
                            tactics in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and presumed that this
                            would be decided by <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> on
                            the spot. Although he personally favored adjournment of both the Greek
                            and British items to the end of the agenda, he was not sure that the
                            British delegation would act to bring this about. He pointed out that
                            the memorandum which was tabled by the British delegation yesterday was
                            one of explanation required by United Nations procedure, and that it
                            should not be construed as British intention to force an early
                            substantive debate on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>We believe that it is clear that the negative attitude expressed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> and reported in

                                    target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note> is explained by the
                            fact that the British decision to intervene in Egypt had at that time
                            been made. Although <persName corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName> may
                            not have been <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0458"/>privy to the
                            decision, the Cabinet had clearly decided not to touch the Cyprus
                            question at that time.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> feels that there is nothing
                            more for him to do until (1) the British have decided what they are to
                            do regarding the Radcliffe report, (2) until the Averoff–<persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> meeting takes place, and (3)
                            until the Cyprus position in the United Nations is more clear. He
                            therefore feels that he should return to Washington to report to
                            Department and unless instructed to the contrary will leave London

                                >Cabot</persName></hi>: As you know, the problem of Cyprus has been
                            under intensive discussion in diplomatic channels, and I thought it
                            would be useful to review briefly what has been happening before the

                            November 10<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">Apparently no change was made
                                here in the language drafted on November 9.</note> for the opening
                            of the Assembly’s regular session. Foreign Minister Averoff arrived on
                            the eighth. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> originally
                            planned to remain until about November 19. He is very anxious, however,
                            to call on the President while here and will stay on after the 19th if
                            necessary to suit the President’s schedule. The Department hopes that
                            the President will be able to see him and has sent a memorandum to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> House requesting an
                            appointment.</p>
                        <p>One of the reasons for <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’
                            decision to head his delegation is to strengthen himself at home by
                            enhancing his prestige <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0459"
                            />internationally. He will undoubtedly make a speech during the general
                            debate. He evidently is confident that the Greek request for inscription
                            of the Cyprus question will succeed, and he therefore intends to follow
                            a moderate course here. He apparently thinks that British policy in the
                            Middle East area is so unpopular that he can safely demonstrate
                            restraint in his public pronouncements at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> with respect to Cyprus and still be sure of sufficient
                            support for inscription. He also will probably want to make some general
                            statements on the world situation …. Further, the Greek Government,
                            which refrained from participating in the Suez conferences, now has
                            informed us that it will support our efforts to seek a peaceful
                            settlement through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Greeks are
                            interested in sending a contingent to the international police
                            force.</p>
                        <p>If these are <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’
                            intentions, you will probably wish to encourage him. The Department has

                        <p>If we can get this sort of restraint from <persName corresp="#p_KC1"

                            to help in bringing about some progress in the interim toward a

                            setback caused by British rejection of proposals advanced privately
                            through us by the Greek Government. We do not know what the effects of

                        <p>On the other hand, there are grounds for optimism in indications from

                            fact that a peaceful solution to the Cyprus question is dependent in
                            large part on direct Greek-Turk contacts and improved relations between
                            them. I refer particularly to Athens 1632 and Ankara 1015.<note n="5"

                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized the justice and moderation of the Greek
                            position. “Everybody knows we are right, but by talking about it we give
                            people a headache.” He had held to a moderate course and done nothing
                            “to hurt a solution” for fourteen months. <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431"
                                facs="0461"/>Time was running out. He asked if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had any suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we were not in a
                            position to offer a solution, but we felt talks between Greece and
                            Turkey were important.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister avoided this and cited as an example of Greek
                            reasonableness their willingness to let <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> decide on the nature of guarantees for bases and
                            minorities On Cyprus. This could be done by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> two, three or four years after self-government was
                            established. At this time the question of how and when to hold a
                            plebiscite could also be decided. In reply to a question he said he did
                            not intend to discuss Cyprus at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Council Meeting in December.</p>
                        <p>He cited the British deportation of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> a week after his election and said, “this was
                            the work of our allies.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed that this had
                            been hard on the Greek Government and said the US supported the <gloss
                                target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> that people are entitled to their own
                            government. It was a question of procedure.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister mentioned that after the use of Cyprus as a base for
                            operations against Egypt, the question of using Cyprus as a base has
                            become more difficult for Greece.</p>
                        <p>As to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, he expected the debate would
                            not take place until after Christmas. If there was no substantial
                            improvement by then, Greece would have to fight in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He raised the question of US support for
                            Greece in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and suggested that the
                            US inform the British that a settlement was definitely possible and that
                            if the UK did not move quickly towards such a settlement, the US would
                            have to oppose the British in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we questioned the
                            value of an acrimonious public debate, which would be exploited by the
                            Soviets. We understood the factors involved and would support every
                            effort to reach a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that if the British wanted a solution, they would
                            start by releasing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that events in
                            the Middle East had not lightened the British load.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> had sufficient prestige to lead the Cypriots in
                            any decision he made. It would be difficult for the Greek Government to
                            find a solution without him. If the British wanted to prove their good
                            faith to the Americans and to the world, they could begin with such a
                            gesture. It would improve the situation by fifty percent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said, “We may explore
                            this with our friends.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said he would
                            continue to do his best, but did not know how long he could stand. The
                            day before (November 14) in the Steering Committee he had given orders
                            to avoid debate <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0462"/>although if he
                            had fought, it would have been very popular in Greece. The Cyprus
                            situation was becoming more serious the longer it remained unsettled.
                            Time was important.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied,
                            “Your approach shows you are exercising great statesmanship. We have
                            nothing to gain by the prolongation of this unhappy crisis between our
                            three friends. Time is important and although the overall situation is
                            not favorable for a settlement of the Cyprus situation, we will do our
                            best.”</p>

                            the United States had not supported Greece as firmly as that country
                            wished on the issue of Cyprus; nevertheless Greece had remained “firmly
                            aligned” with the United States. The Under Secretary referred to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName> mission and noted that
                            although there was no agreement between Greece and Turkey, officials
                            seemed willing for the first time to have secret talks. (Eisenhower

                            luncheon. According to a memorandum of the conversation: <quote

                                    Greece. The Prime Minister had said that it was essential that

                                    regard to Cyprus. He had also stressed that the British attitude
                                    was the key to the situation. If they wanted a settlement one
                                    could be reached. The Prime Minister did not anticipate any
                                    great difficulty with the Turks if the British genuinely desired

                        <p>Pursuant to instructions contained in Department’s top secret telegram
                            907 to Paris, September 8,<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">
                                <ref target="#d194">Document 194</ref>.</note> and oral instructions
                            received from the Secretary in London on September 21, I undertook to
                            explore the positions of the United Kingdom, Greece, and Turkey with
                            respect to the Cyprus dispute. Cables which I sent from Missions abroad
                            contain a record of my discussions and this memorandum-report will be
                            brief. I visited London three times; Athens twice; and Ankara once.</p>
                        <p>The Suez crisis occurred in the midst of these conversations and was, in
                            my opinion, the principal element which handicapped progress. It is now
                            clear that at the time of my first substantive discussion with the
                            British <note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">See <ref target="#d198">Document
                                    198</ref>.</note> the decision had already been taken to
                            intervene with the French in Egypt, and they were unwilling to discuss
                            Cyprus which was their base for the military operation.</p>
                        <p>My estimate of the positions of the three disputants follows:</p>
                        <p>The controlling factor in the British attitude is that the members of the
                            Government have been giving their undivided attention to the Middle East
                            situation and have not put their minds to the possibility of a
                            negotiated settlement in Cyprus. The Radcliffe Constitution and report
                            have been completed and transmitted to <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss>. At the time of my departure from London on November
                            14, they had not yet been considered by Ministers. The question of when
                            a constitution for Cyprus would be promulgated had not been decided nor
                            had the proposal to consult the Greeks and Turks about the constitution
                            been considered. This indecision was brought about not only by
                            preoccupation with Egypt but also by the absence of Ministers, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NSHA1">Nutting</persName>’s resignation, etc … I
                            believe, however, that such a settlement would not commend itself to
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> except as a last resort.</p>
                        <p>…When I got down to specifics with <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> and Averoff, …. they did give me a proposal
                            which I was authorized to present to the British and which might have
                            served as the beginning of a negotiation had the British felt able to
                            make a counteroffer. Although the Greeks appear willing to settle for
                            self-government <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0465"/>now with the
                            question of self-determination put off to the future, they would insist
                            on some definite commitment that the principle of self-determination
                            would be applied to Cyprus at some time. I think there is no doubt that,
                            although the Greeks are prepared to take a reasonable attitude for the
                            time being, there is no doubt of their ambition to incorporate Cyprus
                            into Greek sovereignty. I have the impression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> now feels that he has the
                            British at a disadvantage because of the criticism leveled at the UK for
                            its action in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>I found the Turks, particularly the Prime Minister, considerably less
                            intransigent than their previous utterances had led us to believe.
                            Although much less adamant in their statements, I found them unwilling
                            to agree to any formula of self-government accompanied by anything that
                            resembled a commitment with regard to self-determination for the future.
                            Even the suggestion of the mildest kind of statement which might be made
                            by the UK was immediately construed as being “only a corridor to
                            Enosis”….</p>
                        <p>Although there is no specific progress toward agreement to report, I
                            believe that certain favorable results have emerged from my
                            conversations.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council spent this morning
                            mostly in a wrangle about Cyprus which was inconclusive. However, during
                            noon recess I had a good talk with the Greek Foreign Minister. <note
                                n="2" xml:id="d212fn2">According to <persName>Dulles</persName>,
                                Averoff noted that the Greek Government was willing to agree to any
                                “reasonable” solution to the Cyprus question and added that the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> government had
                                taken political risks in attempting to maintain a flexible position.
                                Averoff asked for U.S. assistance in urging the United Kingdom to
                                consult with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                                the Greeks on Radcliffe’s proposals for a constitution.
                                    <persName>Dulles</persName> agreed to speak with <persName

                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 747c.00/ 12–1356)</note> He strikes me as being
                            very reasonable. He indicated that the Greeks were prepared to support
                            the constitution, which presumably will be proposed by the British, and
                            apparently not press at this time for any action on self-determination.
                            He said however that the result would depend very much upon whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> supported it or
                            not. He said if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            supports a bad settlement, his view will prevail, and if he opposes a
                            good settlement, then, too, his view will prevail. He was very anxious
                            that the British should consult <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> and said they <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437"
                                facs="0467"/>would, if permitted, send someone to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to urge him to come out in
                            support of the present British plan. Also, he indicated that if the
                            Turks wanted partition, the Greeks would be willing to consider
                            that.</p>

                        <p>During meeting with Secretary December 13 <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1"
                                >Birgi</persName> discussed Cyprus at length. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> asserted some solution must be
                            found to avoid debate in United Nations which could only make situation
                            more complicated and perhaps more dangerous. Secretary said he had
                            received today copy of Radcliffe constitution and understood Greeks and
                            Turks had also. Constitution did not prejudge issue of
                            self-determination and he hoped Turkey would find it an acceptable basis
                            to get over present crisis. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> insisted that question of self-determination
                            must be settled now. If left open it would only cause trouble for future
                            and Turkish people would think Greece had received gift. … He stressed
                            importance of Cyprus to security of Turkey. Turkey could accept
                            Radcliffe proposal as draft provided it understood at same time that
                            when self-determination implemented it would be through partition. He
                            thought British desire for haste in making public statement on
                            constitution would only create added difficulties…. Said he recognized
                            that constitution could not be total solution. He stressed importance of
                            immediate proposal. Said he hoped Turkey could look favorably now at
                            Radcliffe constitution leaving partition for future. <persName

                            Turkey could count on United States taking more active part in Middle

                                    totally unacceptable and virtually reserved plenary powers for

                                <p>“I asked what the Greek thinking was about partition, and he said

                                <p>“He strongly urged United States “neutrality” in the forthcoming

                                    its support. He felt confident that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                        >Makarios</persName> would never approve the document.
                                    Averoff stated that in order for such a constitution to work the
                                    governor would have to be a saint as so much power was reserved
                                    to him. He said that he was going to telephone <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> in Athens to give his
                                    opinion. <persName corresp="#p_HJC2">Holmes</persName>
                                    recommended against hasty judgments based on one reading and
                                    suggested that further study of draft constitution might well
                                    lead to more favorable reaction. Averoff agreed to look again
                                    but restated his conviction that Radcliffe plan unsatisfactory.”

                        </list>
                        <p>In his call on the Secretary today, the Greek Ambassador severely
                            criticized the Radcliffe proposals for a constitution for Cyprus,
                            terming them a “mockery” and “very sad”. He said that on instructions
                            from his Prime Minister he wished to ask the Secretary to reconsider the
                            apparent intention of the Department to issue a statement that might be
                            construed in any way as favorable to the proposals.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Secretary said that we must make some kind of statement.
                            However, he assured the Greek Ambassador that whatever statement we made
                            would be kept on a very low key. The Secretary added that we had hoped
                            that the Greek Government would not feel it necessary to reject the
                            Radcliffe proposals out of hand. When the Ambassador retorted that they
                            had studied them fully, the Secretary replied that the proposals could
                            not have been given very much study since the Foreign Minister had told
                            him last week almost immediately after the proposals had been received
                            that Greece could not accept them. The Secretary added that he thought
                            in such matters as these the <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0470"
                            />test was often in the administration of a constitution. He also
                            thought that in the Radcliffe proposals there was at least a basis to
                            ask for further clarification. The Secretary was sorry that the Creeks
                            had felt they had to reject them so hastily without seeking that
                            clarification.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Ambassador responded by again denouncing the proposals as
                            offering a “phony constitution”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary advised him that in these matters the important thing was
                            to get the momentum started or, in other words, to get a foot in the
                            door of independence. The Secretary also referred to the British
                            Government’s present difficult situation which must be recognized as a
                            fact that did not provide a good climate for a Cyprus solution.
                            Referring again to the possibility of a public statement, the Secretary
                            agreed that we might be able to postpone it until further Greek views
                            were presented, but he reiterated to the Ambassador that some sort of
                            statement would have to be made. It was suggested that we could hold off
                            for at least a day or two. The Secretary further said that he would like
                            to see more analyses—both Greek and our own—of the Radcliffe
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from the Secretary regarding our study of the
                            proposals Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WMW1">Williams</persName> stated
                            that we had made an analysis and had found some features which were good
                            and others not so good such as the fact that the whole matter of
                            education seemed to be entirely in the Governor’s hands.<note n="2"

                                    >Rountree</persName> noted that the Radcliffe proposals included

                                retain full control over external affairs, internal security, and
                                defense. Greek Cypriots would have an elected majority in the

                            obtain promptly from his Government its further views regarding the
                            statement we felt impelled to make.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">On
                                December 19, the Department informed the Embassies at Athens,
                                Ankara, and London that the British Foreign Secretary had requested
                                that the United States issue a public statement expressing support
                                for the Radcliffe proposals. The British believed that such a
                                statement would assist Greece with respect to public opinion in
                                taking a position of greater flexibility vis-à-vis the proposals.
                                Although the Department noted that its estimate of the situation was
                                “less sanguine” it instructed the Embassy to inform the Greek
                                Government that the U.S. Government felt obliged to issue a
                                statement that in its view the Radcliffe proposals offered an
                                opportunity “to take important step in direction of self-government
                                and eventual peaceful and satisfactory solution Cyprus problem.” The
                                Department added that it believed it would be against the interests
                                of all parties for the proposals to be “summarily” rejected.

                                <p>“The United States has noted with sympathetic interest the long
                                    and earnest labors of Lord Radcliffe to find a formula for
                                    self-government for Cyprus. The making by the United Kingdom of
                                    proposals for self-government could be the first step toward an
                                    eventual peaceful and generally acceptable final solution of the
                                    Cyprus problem. The formula now produced by Lord Radcliffe seems
                                    to be unacceptable in certain respects by some who are concerned
                                    with the matter. Nevertheless, the United States still hopes
                                    that our three allies who, together with the people of Cyprus,
                                    are deeply concerned with this issue, will strive to agree upon
                                    a way of moving together toward a solution which is so important

                                    cocktail period, saying that I was greatly surprised that the
                                    Greeks had interpreted the State Department’s statement about
                                    the Radcliffe Plan as endorsing that plan. I said that, in fact,
                                    it did not do so and to do so had not been our purpose. Mr.

                        <p>2632. During long discussion of Cyprus with Prime Minister this morning,
                            at his request, I believe progress was made toward narrowing gap here
                            between Greek and Turkish positions. … He said he could accept any
                            solution Cyprus people wanted. He doubted that many Cypriot Turks wanted
                            partition but he was ready and anxious to find out what they wanted
                            through plebiscite. I said I did not believe Turkey was demanding
                            partition but merely plebiscite offering partition as one possible
                            alternative. …</p>
                        <p>I asked whether Greece would ask for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            troops to supervise plebiscite. He said that while <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops would not be necessary, some kind
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commission would have to be
                            authorized to conduct or perhaps supervise or observe plebiscite.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said Averoff’s latest
                            reports from NY were discouraging because he had not been able to obtain
                            any indication what attitude US would take in UNGA debate. I reminded
                            him that British and Turkish Governments were undoubtedly equally
                            anxious to obtain this information and I doubted Averoff had any more
                            reason for discouragement than they.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> reemphasized that if US
                            takes negative position against Greece during <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> debates, demand for new elections here will be
                            irresistible. He said he was not concerned whether his government stayed
                            in office or not but he was deeply concerned about future orientation of
                            Greek foreign policy. He predicted that if solution is not found to
                            Cyprus now, problem will become very much greater international issue
                            within 3 to 6 months and might even jeopardize new <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> doctrine re Middle East. I
                            asked why. He said Arab States, with strong support of Moscow, would
                            demand independence and demilitarization of Cyprus to prevent its being
                            used again as military case against Arabs.</p>
                        <p>I said I felt confident US would not take position hostile to Greece in
                            UNGA but was concerned that if we did not support Greek position 100
                            percent, local press and politicians would construe this as hostile.

                                especially in present Cyprus impasse, to take positive initiative.
                                Present trend Cyprus increasingly harmful and in US interest

                        <p>I am worried at the effect upon Anglo-American relations of the
                            forthcoming debate on Cyprus in the United Nations. We agree, I know,
                            that it would be much better to have no debate at all, but it would
                            appear most unlikely that that will be achieved. The fact of Greek
                            support for terrorism is generally acknowledged here. A hundred United
                            Kingdom citizens as well as a large number of Cypriots have been
                            murdered in this campaign of deliberate violence. Therefore if the
                            United States vote against a Resolution calling for the cessation of
                            Greek activities, it will be regarded here as an unfriendly act and will
                            cause most unfavorable comment. I cannot prejudice the question whether
                            the British Resolution will be pressed to a vote but I do hope that the
                            United States Delegation will make it clear beyond doubt in the course
                            of the debate that the United States Government does not condone the
                            Greek behaviour and urges that it should stop.</p>
                        <p>Forgive me troubling you with a personal message on this matter, but I am
                            most anxious that nothing should happen to hinder the development of our
                            good relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2"><p>On February 10 at 1 p.m.,

                                    According to the transcript of the conversation, the following
                                    occurred:</p>
                                <p>“Re <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName>’s message on
                                    Cyprus. The Sec said what are we going to do about that. The Sec
                                    said he thought we would abstain. That we would say we had
                                    worked hard to find a resolution that would be constructive but
                                    have not been able to do so; we have no resolution of our own
                                    and will abstain from any resolutions with substantive
                                    implications. The Sec said of course it is always possible in
                                    the course of the debate to change our minds but that is the way
                                    we feel now.</p>
                                <p>“The Sec said R. was to be sure to get some rest; he was to do no
                                    more work that day. We would be in real trouble if he
                                    collapsed.</p>
                                <p>“Re the <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> message
                                    again, the Sec asked if he had to answer it or only acknowledge
                                    it…. The Sec asked when the Cyprus question would come up at the

                                    probably Cyprus would come up Tuesday [Feb. 12].” (Eisenhower

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> opened the meeting with
                            a brief reference to proposed Turkish revisions to the United States
                            resolution on Cyprus that had been circulated by the United States
                            Delegation in New York last week. The Secretary did not comment on the
                            Turkish suggestions. Instead he expressed doubt that it would be wise
                            for the United States to present any proposal. He pointed out that we
                            had tried hard to help the parties in arriving at a solution to the
                            Cyprus problem and that all our efforts had come to nought. It was
                            tragic to see this dispute go on for it not only involved the solidarity
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but threatened the position of
                            the present Greek Government and endangered the entire Mediterranean
                            area. These, he said, were the real stakes here. The three interested
                            parties were putting something of lesser importance ahead of the greater
                            issue and until they were prepared to make some compromises he did not
                            feel the United States had any responsibility to continue its efforts to
                            find a solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> responded by saying that
                            he thought it was a good <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> for the
                            United States not to put forward a solution. He contrasted the passive
                            Turkish attitude on the Cyprus matter over the last two or three years
                            to the manner in which the Greeks had pressed the matter, supported
                            terrorism, and maintained inflammatory radio broadcasts out of Athens.
                            The Greeks had persisted in this course of action in the face of Turkish
                            pleas that the present equilibrium not be disturbed. The Turks,
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> asserted, have more
                            rights and are making more sacrifices on the Cyprus issue than the
                            Greeks and they want to see this matter quieted down….</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked his Turkish visitors if they were satisfied
                            that, given a continuation of the present situation in Cyprus, a
                            Western-oriented government in Greece could be expected to <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0477"/>continue. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> asserted that the Greeks were
                            only exploiting their internal political situation to attain their
                            objectives in Cyprus and that public opinion would not be aroused in
                            Greece if the Greeks did not get their own way on Cyprus. The Secretary
                            declined to accept this judgment. He took a grave view of the Greek
                            situation. He pointed to the serious implications of a Greek shift from
                            the West and cautioned the Turks not to come to the United States for
                            help if the United States were proven right in its estimate. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> broke in to
                            acknowledge that Greek political disturbances growing out of the Cyprus
                            issue were possible but went on to say that political instability was
                            inherent in Greek political life and that even if the Cyprus problem
                            were solved another situation would be created to feed this chronic
                            restlessness. The Greeks had put their pretensions too high…. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> emphasized that
                            Turkey is not seeking the defeat of Greece on this matter but rather a
                            reasonable solution that would provide safety for the Turkish Cypriots
                            and security for Turkey itself. The Secretary closed this part of the
                            discussion by again pointing out that disaster was impending that was so
                            great that Cyprus paled in comparison. The Greeks, Turks and British
                            apparently did not share this view. They may be right. Since no one else
                            shared our view on the gravity of the situation, the United States
                            should then sit back and watch.</p>
                        <p>At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> asked
                            the Secretary what was his advice to Turkey at the present time. The
                            Secretary replied that first of all the UNGA debate should be kept as
                            calm as possible. <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> agreed with this and
                            with the view that any substantive action by the UNGA would be damaging.
                            After the UNGA debate, the Secretary suggested that the matter might be
                            taken up by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It was essential, he
                            said, that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> be capable of dealing
                            with its own problems. It had expressed an interest in a lot of problems
                            far away, such as Formosa, but had thus far shied away from immediate
                            vital problems such as Cyprus. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> pointed out that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> discussions had thus far been friendly and had been on
                            subjects on which there had been a wide range of agreement and that the
                            injection of the Cyprus issue would therefore be dangerous, the
                            Secretary replied that if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was so
                            fragile that it could not discuss matters vital to its future then this
                            in itself pointed to a vital weakness in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. He went on to say this highlighted again the fact
                            that the three countries were putting second things first and until the
                            magnitude of the peril inherent in the Cyprus situation was realized no
                            solution was possible.</p>
                        <p>When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> referred briefly to
                            the Radcliffe proposals and stated that the Greeks want only Enosis, the
                            Secretary disagreed. The Secretary thought the Greeks would accept
                            self-government, perhaps even without assurances of self-determination,
                            but the point <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0478"/>in the Radcliffe
                            proposals that worried the Greeks was the broad powers reserved for the
                            executive. The Secretary went on to say that it was hardly possible to
                            prepare a constitution without some provision calling for the invasion
                            of the rights of one branch of the government by another in the event of
                            an emergency. If because of the lack of trust and confidence every such
                            constitutional ambiguity were regarded as a booby-trap, then no
                            effective constitutional framework could be established. The core of the
                            present problem was this lack of mutual confidence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary closed the meeting by paying tribute to the wisdom,
                            orientation and dependability of present Turkish leadership. He lauded
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1">Birgi</persName>’s effective work at
                            the London Conference and expressed the hope that on the Cyprus problem
                            the Government of Turkey would manifest the same mature

                            reviewed briefly his talk with Ambassador Eban of Israel and described
                            certain assurances which the US would be willing to give Israel if
                            Israel will promptly withdraw from Egyptian territory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then opened a general discussion of the Cyprus problem,
                            with particular reference to its current status in the UNGA. <pb n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449" facs="0479"/>He referred to his recent talks with
                            representatives of the Turkish Government and also made reference to the
                            message from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> urging the US not to vote against the proposed UK
                            resolution calling for a cessation of terrorist activities in Cyprus.
                            The Secretary pointed out that the US has tried in various ways to be
                            helpful on the Cyprus issue but has thus far been unable to find any
                            satisfactory approach. Therefore, the present disposition of the US
                            Government is to announce at the beginning of the Cyprus debate that the
                            United States will not vote on any resolution at all. In other words,
                            the US is inclined to abstain on any substantive resolution concerning
                            Cyprus, whether sponsored by the Greek Government or the British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> asked whether
                            it will be possible for the US representative, during the course of the
                            debate, to make a statement indicating US opposition to terrorist
                            activities and external interference in Cyprus, perhaps along the same
                            general lines as the statement made by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> in the debate on Algeria. The
                            Secretary replied that some general statement on terrorism may be
                            possible. He added, however, that the US may also have to express its
                            general support for the principle of self-determination, in
                            approximately the same terms used in the Potomac Charter.<note n="3"

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> expressed the
                            hope that any expression by the US on self-determination would include a
                            recognition of the fact that the Radcliffe proposals are aimed at the
                            achievement of self-determination for Cyprus. The Secretary said it
                            would be impossible for the US to pass judgment on particular
                            constitutional proposals, since the value of any constitutional system
                            depends primarily upon its practical application. He pointed out that
                            any constitution is capable of abuse, and made reference to the Soviet
                            Constitution. The Secretary indicated that the content of the US
                            statement has not yet been determined, but stressed the impossibility of
                            dealing with any single aspect of the Cyprus problem outside the context
                            of the total situation and said the principal purpose of any US
                            statement will be to avoid making a bad situation worse.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to emphasize the grave dangers to the whole Western
                            world inherent in the present Cyprus situation. Unless some kind of
                            solution to the Cyprus problem can be found, he said, Greece may be lost
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. This would breach the southern
                            flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and might permit the
                            Communists to cut across the Mediterranean. The Secretary expressed the
                            view that there has been far too much emotionalism associated with the
                                <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0480"/>Cyprus question—so much, in
                            fact, that the governments concerned have been unable to consider the
                            issue in a broad perspective and seem unwilling to subordinate minor
                            considerations to major considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether the Turks had indicated willingness to make
                            any concessions on the Cyprus question. The Secretary replied that he
                            has observed no definite indications of this kind, but feels there is
                            some possibility that the Turks would be willing to accept a “<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> solution”. The Secretary expressed
                            the view that it would be far better for all parties to deal with the
                            problem through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> than through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He added that the Turks seem
                            willing to agree to a solution based on partition.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> asked whether
                            the Turks and others have considered the practical consequences of
                            partitioning an island as small as Cyprus. He suggested that a proposal
                            for partition is a “council of despair” and should be considered only as
                            a last resort.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then repeated the basic US objectives in the current UNGA
                            debate on Cyprus. He pointed out that we do not believe any UNGA action
                            is likely to contribute to a solution of the Cyprus problem and said
                            that we may make a statement to this effect at the beginning of the
                            debate. He reminded Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1"
                                >Caccia</persName> that the US long opposed subjecting this issue to
                            public debate, and now hopes that the debate can be terminated with a
                            minimum of acrimony and without perpetuating <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> involvement. For these reasons, the US is disposed to
                            abstain on any substantive resolution presented, although the final US
                            position will depend upon the course of events. The US may undertake
                            some new initiative if it appears that doing so will serve a useful
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> emphasized the
                            important difference between the current US disposition to abstain on
                            any substantive resolution and the earlier US position, which was to
                            oppose actively any such resolution. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName>, however, did not comment upon
                            the implications of this change in US intentions.</p>

                        <p>619. Following is Department’s present thinking re Cyprus:</p>
                        <p>As friend of parties involved and in earnest effort be helpful in
                            developing arrangements which would have least adverse effects upon
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and cooperation among its
                            allies, US in recent past has put forward for consideration various
                            proposals all of which have been strongly opposed by either Greeks
                            British or Turks. These developments have underlined reluctance of
                            Greeks British and Turks to make necessary compromise essential to
                            agreed solution. In our view major issues of preserving <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> solidarity and forestalling communist
                            penetration of Mediterranean are being subordinated to lesser issue of
                            Cyprus and more narrow interests of three parties concerned therewith.
                            Unless and until parties recognize magnitude of peril involved in
                            continuation of Cyprus stalemate and are prepared make necessary
                            compromises, US efforts toward finding solution will continue be
                            frustrated.</p>
                        <p>Department has concluded that in present circumstances it cannot, without
                            jeopardy to more important considerations, play affirmative role at this
                            time with respect proposals which have been put forward by parties. It
                            had intended making clear at outset <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            debate that we would vote against any condemnatory resolution (such as
                            British condemnation of Greek Government for interference Cyprus) or any
                            other resolution of substantive character (such as one calling for
                            immediate self determination). In view opposition to this position US
                            now disposed abstain on any such resolutions and at appropriate stage in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> discussions we would explain our
                            position. As debate develops it might prove advisable for US to take
                            some initiative. We have in mind that future attitude would depend
                            largely on development opportunities for constructive action and on
                            whether our friends are able to avoid taking extreme and harmful
                            positions. We would be governed mainly by our continued desire keep
                            debate in low key and minimize US involvement in Cyprus.</p>

                            forward resolution itself and agreed debate should be kept to minimum
                            and hoped no substantive action would be taken. They hoped that as
                            various resolutions submitted our respective delegations would keep in
                            touch on tactics. (Separate telegram contains fuller account this

                                February 8, the Department instructed the Mission at the United
                                Nations to make clear to the British, Greeks, and Turks that the
                                United States planned to take no further initiative at this time.

                            American neutrality in the Cyprus debate. He appreciated the delicacy of
                            the problem for the United States and therefore asked only our <hi
                                rend="italic">neutrality</hi> and not our support. Of course, from a
                            friend, Greece would have preferred support.</p>
                        <p>He added that the present problem in the United Nations was to get out of
                            the debate without damage to a settlement and with some help towards it.
                            “We want,” he said, “to have a discussion without insulting each other
                            too much.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said Greece must, of course, press its resolution
                            for self-determination for Cyprus. As a second choice, he would want a
                            resolution favoring renewal of negotiations. He insisted that a
                            resolution calling for three-power talks with Turks and British would be
                            dangerous, because Syria and Egypt were already insisting that they
                            should be included since Cyprus was strategically important to them as
                            well as to Turkey. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> reiterated that <pb
                                n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0484"/>the best negotiations would be
                            between the British Government and the Cypriots. A resolution to this
                            effect should be sought, with a provision that the Secretary General
                            should report to the next Assembly on the progress of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the Assembly, he recognized Turkey’s three main arguments against
                            self-determination and against possible enosis for Cyprus: (1) the
                            strategic argument that Greek islands would “besiege” Turkey, which he
                            would meet by proposing demilitarization of Cyprus with only <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> bases; (2) the argument of Turkey’s
                            trading interests, which he thought could be met by arrangements for a
                            customs union; and (3) the minority argument, which could be settled by
                            providing to the Turkish minority all the privileges that Turkey herself
                            wanted to fix under a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee, with
                            possibility of dual nationality and protection against military service
                            in Greece.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> then said this was a period of high
                            fever and one must seek to reduce the fever. If that is possible, one
                            can—with good will—solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>He referred to the question of bases and said that though Greece in the
                            past had not been opposed to British bases on Cyprus, Greece now felt
                            that the bases on the island should be <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> bases, since UK bases only caused “foreign
                            irritation”. (He reported that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> had said he had nothing against <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> bases in Cyprus, though he objected
                            to British bases there.) Averoff also said the bases and the island
                            might come under some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>Steps towards a solution could be taken, said Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName>, either through <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which required “quiet, old-fashioned
                            diplomacy” or through the return of Archbishop Makarios, whose influence
                            was obviously very great on the island.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName>’s presentation, the
                            Secretary remarked that the Greek Foreign Minister had gone much more
                            deeply into the substance of the Cyprus controversy than he himself was
                            prepared to go and had demonstrated the wide range of the problem. The
                            Secretary added that he had been particularly impressed by Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName>’s remark that one must get the
                            temperature down.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary made the following additional points: <list>

                                <item>Debates in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were most
                                    useful if they avoided emotional attacks and merely exposed
                                    problems to world opinion. The educational value of debates was
                                    often much greater than the advantage gained by pushing through
                                    some resolution by a narrow margin.</item>

                                    concessions, the harm to them individually would be much less

                                    framework was welcomed.</item>

                                    embarrassment, we had shown lately that in order to do the right
                                    thing we were willing to take sides even against a

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Political Committee began
                            discussing Cyprus February 18. Three resolutions have been submitted: a
                            Greek proposal asserting the right of self-determination for the
                            Cypriots; a British proposal calling for Greece to take measures to
                            prevent support for terrorism; and a Greek proposal calling for
                            establishment of a factfinding committee to investigate the UK charges
                            of terrorism against Greece.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">For texts of
                                these three resolutions, see U.N. Docs. A/C1/L.168, A/C.1/L.170, and
                                A/C.1/L/169, respectively.</note> It is currently unclear whether
                            the UK would still regard a vote against its terrorism resolution as an
                            “unfriendly act” or whether it would accept a negative vote as the price
                            for a negative US vote on the Greek self-determination resolution and
                            the Greek resolution on a fact finding commission.<note n="3"

                                    Secretary’s Staff meeting, <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1"
                                        >Walmsley</persName> raised the question of Cyprus in the
                                    United Nations. The notes of the meeting read:</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> reported
                                    that the British called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1"
                                        >Wilcox</persName> yesterday and asked that we reconsider
                                    our present position of abstaining when the UK resolution and
                                    the two Greek resolutions come to a vote in the UNGA. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> said the
                                    British now recognize it would be better if we voted against all
                                    three resolutions, for they have come to the realization that if
                                    we abstain, the Greek resolutions will in all likelihood be
                                    approved. The Secretary said we must approach this issue with
                                    caution since he had received a note from Foreign Minister
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> that a US
                                    vote against the UK resolution would be considered ’an
                                    unfriendly act.’ The Secretary also noted that we had announced
                                    our position privately to the Turkish and Greek Foreign
                                    Ministers and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1"
                                        >Caccia</persName> and said that if we change our position
                                    at this juncture it will be necessary to take it up with all
                                    three parties. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                        >Rountree</persName> remarked that the British and Turks
                                    would welcome such a change but the Greeks would be infuriated.
                                    He also emphasized the need for a quick decision since the
                                    matter could come to a vote in the General Assembly today. The
                                    Secretary reiterated that he wanted this matter handled with
                                    great care.” (Department of State, Secretary’s Staff Meetings:

                        <p>Meantime our Delegation in New York will make clear in its statement,
                            without, however, disclosing how the US will vote, that the US does not
                            believe any of the resolutions, irrespective of their possible merits,
                            would contribute to a solution, and will express the hope their sponsors
                            will not press them to a vote. Our estimate is that the Greek resolution
                            on self-determination would be adopted if the US abstains. In its
                            present form the Greek resolution would set a dangerous and undesirable
                            precedent that any territory may determine its own future independently
                            of other interests involved.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances there are two alternatives; the first is

                                <item>If the UK can accept a negative US vote on its proposal or
                                    decides not to press it to a vote, the preferred course would be
                                    for the US to initiate, preferably through others, but if
                                    necessary itself, a procedural-type resolution which would refer
                                    to the necessity of good relations between nations and peoples
                                    and express the view that appropriate negotiations should be
                                    undertaken to achieve a solution. Whether the US or others
                                    submit the resolution, we should make sure we can maintain
                                    control of its content.</item>

                        <p>Between February 18 and 22, the First Committee of the General Assembly
                            held ten meetings to consider the Cyprus item. During the course of the
                            discussion, four draft resolutions submitted by Greece, the United
                            Kingdom, and Panama were considered by the Committee. No vote was taken
                            on any of the resolutions. On February 22, India introduced a resolution
                            (1013 XI) that was approved by a plenary session of the General Assembly
                            on February 26, by a vote of 76 to 0. The resolution noted that the
                            General Assembly hoped that a “peaceful, democratic and just solution”
                            would be found to the problem of Cyprus. It also expressed the hope that
                            negotiations would be continued toward this end. For a summary of
                            developments at the United Nations and the full text of the resolution,

                                found in Cyprus or Greece, under present circumstances, to take any
                                decisions that could ever be accepted by all concerned.” <persName

                        <p>Prime Minister emphasized that next two months will provide best
                            opportunity to settle Cyprus issue. Advantage should be taken of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution to act now and avoid
                            complications which arise every year beginning in June or July regarding
                            further Cyprus debates in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Prime
                            Minister re-emphasized that release of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> is only possible way to achieve results and
                            expressed confidence that following such release acceptable solution
                            will be found. It is clear that both he and Averoff are now thinking
                            almost exclusively along lines of independence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said he was confident
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> himself preferred
                            independence to Enosis and that as soon as <gloss target="#t_GOG1"
                                >GOG</gloss> could make contact with him it would make useful
                            suggestions to him.</p>
                        <p>Averoff is confident that British are looking [for] face-saving formula
                            to give them excuse for releasing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName>. British Ambassador asked him last week what
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could do to make this possible.
                            In parliamentary debate last night, Averoff expressed confidence that
                            fighting in Cyprus would stop if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> were released. Opposition is attacking him
                            today on ground that he has offered to bargain for release of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and he admits that this was
                            purpose of his statement as assurance that Greek Government would make
                            every effort to obtain cease-fire if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> is released. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> added that more and more people, including
                            President of UNGA, are pressing British to release <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that everyone concerned
                            with Cyprus question would feel great surge of enthusiasm if this step
                            taken. I expressed doubts that Turks would show much pleasure <pb
                                n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0490"/>since they do not regard him as
                            spokesman for all Cypriots. Averoff said Turks also want satisfactory
                            Cyprus settlement and must be aware that no progress towards either
                            partition or independence is possible without <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I said I believed most Americans thought <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> should be released but question was how
                            strongly this be pressed on Government of UK. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said we should stand up for our political
                            principles.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I have come with some reluctance to
                            conclusion that British hope of finding more tractable elements to deal
                            with in Cyprus have proved unjustified. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> appears to be gaining strength among Greek
                            Cypriots, much as exiled Sultan did among Moroccans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has achieved too
                            well-established position among Cypriots to be either supplanted or put
                            aside. Since British must eventually deal with him or else continue to
                            have sullen, uncooperative and quarrelsome majority on Cyprus even after
                            organized resistance is put down, they would save much trouble for
                            themselves and everyone else by bringing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> to London now.</p>
                        <p>I am still not happy about independence as solution and reminded Prime
                            Minister today that Soviets would start intriguing in Cyprus at first
                            possible opportunity. Moreover, many Cypriots will continue to agitate
                            for Enosis and internal turmoil result, much as it did in Texas, where
                            annexation of Republic finally brought on war with Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Despite foregoing I agree that Cyprus problem must be solved some way and
                            if Greece and Turkey are willing to accept guaranteed independence, … if
                            supported by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, with whom

                            Kingdom and Cypriots (<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>),
                            which in view of the history of this problem do not seem likely to be
                            successful if renewed substantially on the same basis as where they left
                            off.</p>
                        <p>We confess that the above reasoning is to some extent conditioned on the
                            shifting positions that it seems to us the Greeks (read also <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>) have taken in previous
                            rounds of negotiation which we fear might well be rationalized by the
                            Greeks as the optimum strategy toward their manifest long-term objective
                            of enosis. In addition to record of direct negotiations with <persName

                                >Karamanlis</persName> insistence last autumn that Greeks could
                            accept self-government with nod towards future self-determination and
                            their present talk of independence. …</p>
                        <p>In circumstances, we question whether progress can be made toward
                            solution by working, essentially procedurally, for improvement
                            atmosphere until we ourselves anyhow determine what substantive solution
                            we are aiming at, are prepared to try to hold the Greeks to and to sell
                            to the United Kingdom and Turks. We would, therefore, recommend that
                            United States (1) determine solution we believe most desirable and
                            durable in light all factors of situation, and (2) embark on campaign to
                            achieve its acceptance by all parties.</p>
                        <p>Realize this suggested re-direction course our efforts involves more
                            direct involvement in problem than would be desirable if we could avoid
                            it. However, if we estimate importance of solution is sufficient to
                            warrant play for stakes risks would seem to be acceptable. In absence
                            some such United States leadership we see no end to matter and United
                            Kingdom imposed self-government with consequent continual Greek
                            agitation and further exacerbative interallied feud.</p>

                        <p>[Here follow a list of participants and discussion of unrelated
                            matters.]</p>
                        <p>The question of Cyprus was discussed next. <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1"
                                >Selwyn Lloyd</persName> began by stating that the British welcomed
                                <persName corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName>’s initiative, but
                            unfortunately the Greeks turned it down although their reply may not be
                            final. He believed that the Turks would accept <persName
                                corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName>’s initiative, and mentioned the
                            other details of the British statement on Cyprus just made in
                                London.<note n="2" xml:id="d232fn2"><persName corresp="#p_LBA1"
                                    >Lennox-Boyd</persName> noted that the British were prepared to
                                release <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if he
                                agreed to renounce the use of terrorism. For text of the Colonial
                                Secretary’s statement, see <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi>
                                (R.I.I.A.) for 1957, pp. 411–412.</note></p>
                        <p>The President said that he had received many representations from various
                            sources emphasizing that if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> were returned to Cyprus, real progress toward a
                            solution of the present problem could start.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> replied that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had been the origin
                            and foundation of terrorism in Cyprus, that there were now indications
                            that this terrorism was failing, and that not all Cypriots are prepared
                            to accept <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as their
                            spokesman. The British think that terrorism is much weaker now than
                            before, and that the populace of Cyprus is getting fed up with it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> added that the
                            British believe that the Turks take Cyprus very seriously and would be
                            unwilling to let Greece have this island, which is so close to their
                            coast. The British therefore regard themselves as a sort of
                            “trustee”.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister confirmed that the British are not greatly interested
                            in Cyprus except for the military importance of the island, a factor
                            which is changing and probably now less than before. Were it not for the
                            Turks, the British probably would have gone much further by now toward a
                            solution. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> also
                            emphasized that he is not without hope that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName> may accept the latest British offer.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister and President agreed that the military importance of
                            Cyprus today has become rather less, though it was still useful to have
                            a base there.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister urged that the US should try and influence the Greeks
                            to accept <persName corresp="#p_IBHL1">Ismay</persName>’s
                            initiative.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0496"/>
                        <p>The President indicated that he would certainly be willing to consider
                            doing this, and urged the British to free <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                >Makarios</persName>. In any case, he added, the US believes what
                            the British leaders have just said about their real aims regarding
                            Cyprus, is sympathetic with the British problem in Cyprus, and would
                            certainly do its best to try and help.</p>

                        <p>On March 21, the President wrote a diary entry recording his impressions
                            of discussions held that day at the Bermuda Conference. It reads: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Prime Minister outlined the major factors in the whole
                                    Cyprus problem. They are quite complicated and he asserts that
                                    Britain wants nothing more to do with the island except to keep
                                    its base there, but any action that the British can suggest up
                                    to this moment antagonizes either the Greeks or the Turks. The
                                    British believe that the antagonisms that would be created by
                                    dropping the British responsibility in the island might even
                                    lead to war between the Turks and the Greeks.</p>
                                <p>“I told them that I had certain important messages, particularly
                                    from the Greeks, asking me to urge upon <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> the importance of
                                    freeing Archbishop Makarios. I told them that in my opinion I
                                    didn’t believe they were gaining much by keeping him prisoner,
                                    so I would just turn him loose on the world. At the very least
                                    this would prove to the world that the British were trying to
                                    reach a solution to this problem. My impression is that they are
                                    probably going to turn him loose, but subject only to his
                                    agreement not to go back to Cyprus and to abjure violence.”

                        <p>I would like to tell you that I very much appreciated your letter of
                            March 15, 1957.<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">See <ref target="#d228fn2"

                            problem, especially with respect to Archbishop Makarios, were of great
                            value to me and <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0498"/>my associates
                            at Bermuda and during the Conference I took the opportunity of urging
                            that the Archbishop be released.</p>
                        <p>It is encouraging to learn that the Archbishop has recently been offered
                            the opportunity of leaving the Seychelles. His release presents a great
                            opportunity and, as you stated in your letter, marks ‘a definite step
                            toward a possible solution of this thorny problem’. I sincerely hope
                            that with your advice and encouragement the Greek Government will do
                            everything possible to use this opportunity for the purpose of creating
                            an atmosphere which will lead to constructive negotiations between the
                            leaders of the Cypriot communities and the British authorities.</p>
                        <p>Further, I would urge you to consider the possibility that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> could at the same time play a useful

                            separated, and if they are approached with courage and resourcefulness,
                            I believe that this painful problem can gradually but certainly be
                            solved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United

                            Makarios. I know that this entailed great difficulty for you. I
                            earnestly hope that his release will bring about a substantial
                            improvement in the atmosphere relating to Cyprus, with greater prospects

                        <p>I want you to know that we will do all we can to encourage others
                            concerned to approach the matter in a constructive and conciliatory

                            was not taken without loss to the Government. I do not believe that the
                            Archbishop has changed his views in the Seychelles; he is the Bourbon of
                            Cyprus. But events in the island <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0500"

                        <p>I am sure that your aid in persuading all concerned to face reality could
                            be of decisive help. Of course my right-wing assume that we released the
                            Archbishop at your request, so private pressure by you would be better
                            than public statements.</p>

                            Turkey, and that the Greek Government was in ”close collaboration” with

                            “before its proper public opinion”, is “a manifest proof of its

                        <p>This proposed approach to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will be
                            designed primarily to indicate that US now seriously doubts whether

                            solutions and that US now believes that either independence within the

                            with a treaty preventing enosis are worthy serious consideration. Within
                            context <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2220 we have in mind
                            developing these further views along following lines:</p>
                        <p>Any change in status Cyprus must be accomplished gradually if there is to
                            be a peaceful solution. It would not appear practical in present tense
                            situation and in view Cypriots’ relative inexperience in <pb n="474"
                                xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>governing themselves, to pass directly
                            to some form self-determination without providing for predetermined
                            period of self-government, such a period would afford Cypriots
                            opportunity to assume increased measure of responsibility for their own
                            affairs and might also permit present tensions to cool.</p>
                        <p>Because self-government would appear best prelude to any final solution,
                            it follows that representatives of Island’s communities should negotiate
                            with <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> on mutually acceptable form
                            self-government, since responsibility for achieving successful
                            self-government will rest largely with Cypriots. The choice of these
                            representatives should be left to members of Cypriot communities.</p>
                        <p>It seems unlikely Cypriots will agree on self-government as interim
                            solution unless they have fairly clear conception eventual status
                            Island. Concurrently, therefore, with these negotiations between <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> and representatives Cypriot
                            communities, future status Cyprus might appropriately be explored within
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework. These explorations
                            might possibly lead to a treaty whereby within a fixed term of years
                            there would be a plebiscite to determine future status Cyprus. <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> negotiations should be secret and
                            insofar as possible, seriatim.</p>
                        <p>Obviously eventual status Cyprus can only be finally settled by agreement
                            between parties directly concerned. However, reestablishment good
                            relations between <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is matter of primary concern not only
                            to both Governments, but to all Free World. At the present time, either
                            enosis or partition would appear to be counterproductive to
                            reestablishment good relations. Enosis would in the foreseeable future
                            seriously exacerbate Turk-Greek relations. Partition would appear do the
                            same. It would also pose grave and perhaps permanent political and
                            economic problems on Cyprus. Both Turk and Greek communities are fairly
                            evenly distributed throughout Island. It would seem almost impossible
                            divide Cyprus equitably, would certainly require major population
                            transfer and would leave in its wake bitterness and resentments among
                            entire Cypriot population.</p>
                        <p>A solution promising more hope for improved Turk-Greek relations might be
                            that of offering Cypriots, after fixed period self-government, choice
                            between independence within British Commonwealth and independence
                            outside Commonwealth. In either case there would be a treaty signed by
                            interested and friendly nations, as well as Government of Cyprus as then
                            constituted, whereby Cyprus would be independent and would not become
                            part of any other nation without full consent of the parties most
                            intimately concerned. (<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> UK, Greece,

                        <p>In telegram 5734 from London, April 18, the Embassy informed the
                            Department that the British Foreign Office had no objection to
                            Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> presenting to the Turkish
                            Government the views contained in telegram 7312, <ref target="#d241"><hi
                                    rend="italic">supra</hi></ref>. The Foreign Office added,
                            however, that instead of telling Turkey that the United States had
                            “discussed” these views with the United Kingdom, that the Turks be told
                            that the United States had “informed” the British about them.

                        <p>On April 18, the Embassy at Athens informed the Department that it fully
                            agreed with the line presented in telegram 7312. The Embassy added that
                            a distinction should be made between the “eventual status of Cyprus” and
                            “self-determination”. (Telegram 3502 from Athens, April 18; <hi

                        <p>In telegram 2424 from Ankara, April 20, the Embassy, in its interim reply
                            to telegram 7312 to London, noted that “unless there is some drastic
                            change in political atmosphere, it is no more possible that Turks would
                            sit down at same negotiation table with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"

                        <p>On April 18, the Office of the United States Permanent Representative to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> informed the Department that
                            it agreed with the Department’s position as outlined in telegram 7312 to
                            London, repeated as <gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1960. The
                            Office added, however, that it was important to recognize Turkish
                            concern for the protection of the rights of the Turkish minority,
                            especially during any period of independence. (<gloss target="#t_Polto1"

                        <p>In telegram 399 from Nicosia, April 18, the Consulate noted that both the
                            solution and the procedure described in telegram 7312 to London were
                            contrary to what seemed to be some of the basic tenets of the Greeks and
                            the Turks. Although the Consulate noted that renunciation of enosis by
                            the Greek Cypriots was unlikely, it was not impossible that Cypriot
                            acceptance could not be obtained, “provided, of course, leads from
                            Athens and Ankara did not prevent” it. (<hi rend="italic"

                                to the Turkish aide-mémoire of April 4 (see <ref target="#d238"

                        <p>The Prime Minister remarked when I finished that his government would
                            study my presentation (of which they made minute, <pb n="477"
                                xml:id="pg_477" facs="0507"/>careful notes) point by point and he
                            would give me Turkish observations very soon.</p>
                        <p>My presentation was received completely dead-pan.</p>
                        <p>When I reached point about independence, <persName corresp="#p_Birgi1"
                                >Birgi</persName> completed two sentences for me before I could do
                            so. First instance, he anticipated word “independence”. Second time he
                            supplied “within British Commonwealth”. This makes me think my remarks
                            were not surprise for them.</p>
                        <p>I tried lay groundwork for later consultations and appeals, repeating
                            Department’s <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> Turks statesmanship,
                            restraint, and need for calm atmosphere to work out solution. Prime
                            Minister then emphasized there limit on restraint beyond which cannot
                            go. That limit has been reached. He stated Greeks are making
                            categorical, dogmatic claims publicly which are freezing Greek position,
                            satisfying Greek public opinion. Prime Minister said must now face up
                            political requirements here in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>On conclusion my remarks, Prime Minister asked me how much of my remarks
                            he could pass on to parliamentary groups and how much use in
                            parliamentary debate. I replied I had not foreseen his query and so did
                            not have the answer. I ventured the opinion, however, that Washington
                            would not want its ideas disclosed to parliamentary groups or used in
                            Assembly debate.</p>
                        <p>I said I felt that would violate very purpose USA efforts and prevent USA
                            and Turkey make headway this problem.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister then stressed he has delayed for fifteen days answering
                            parliamentary inquiry, that his preliminary remarks will no longer hold
                            situation, that he must make suitable reply Assembly. In his reply he
                            must clarify the views, intentions and policy his government order to
                            protect Turkish position in light Greek buildup.</p>
                        <p>I believe Prime Minister doubtless will discuss my presentation with his
                            confidants in government but discussions with parliamentary groups and
                            parliamentary debate are still of great importance to <gloss

                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> proposed that U.S.
                            assume <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-sponsored trusteeship over
                            Cyprus during interim period prior to self-determination. I immediately
                            pointed out that this would not be feasible for several reasons. We
                            would be shouldering responsibilities which those directly concerned
                            should carry. Moreover, U.S. is already accused of speaking against
                            colonialism because U.S. wishes to supplant existing imperialist
                            overlords. He said if people of Cyprus requested US trusteeship, no one
                            could accuse U.S. of imperialism. On contrary, this would be first time
                            any great power had assumed governmental responsibilities at request of
                            population and would consequently be opposite of imperialism. I asked if
                            he had any evidence that Turkish as well as Greek Cypriots would like
                            it. He said he thought they would. He added that our recently assumed
                            responsibilities in Middle East made it imperative for us to take bold
                            steps to help solve Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>I asked how British Government could justify recalling all its officials
                            from Cyprus and seeing them replaced by Americans. He acknowledged the
                            difficulties but pointed out that British had shifted its
                            responsibilities to U.S. elsewhere, including the shift in Greece itself
                            in 1947. Since U.S. had to support free-world, he thought we should
                            exercise our responsibilities directly.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is difficult to believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> advanced this proposal with
                            serious belief it might be accepted. I am inclined to regard it as
                            tactic designed to show he has come forth with something, however
                            far-fetched, and that ball is now in our or someone else’s court.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> noted that his
                                meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had
                                been arranged by Averoff, who suggested that the conversation take
                                place at his house. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                                added that rather than give the meeting a “conspiratorial aspect”,
                                he suggested that the meeting take place at his home. The Ambassador
                                reported that he and the Archbishop had agreed to try to keep the
                                meeting from becoming public. If it did become known, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> concluded, he was prepared to
                                say that “several sources” had suggested that the meeting might be a
                                useful one and that he had agreed in order to obtain a better
                                understanding of the Cyprus problem. (Department of State, Central

                                State noted that the United States should not take steps to
                                facilitate the return of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1"
                                    >Makarios</persName> to Cyprus in view of “extreme Turk
                                sensibilities.” The Department added that it believed that the
                                Archbishop would arrive in Cyprus via London soon enough, and
                                meanwhile the Turks “needed time to cool”. The Department instructed
                                the Embassy that when it was appropriate it might wish to indicate
                                to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that he should
                                travel to London to “establish contact there.” The Department added,
                                for the information of the Embassy, that the U.S. position was that
                                both partition and enosis seemed impractical. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 747C.00/4–2457)</note> During talk with <persName

                            his return to Cyprus and he did not bring it up. I did press him
                            earnestly, however, to bring about end of terrorist threat on island as
                            most important next step towards solution. I pointed out that neither
                            British nor Turks would be ready to negotiate as long as he had armed
                            organization in being which could be called into action at any time. I
                            thought he could justify taking bold measures against terrorism on the
                            grounds that his release from exile was beginning of new phase of Cyprus
                            question, and urged him to present himself to world as man of peace,
                            which befitted his clerical garb.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> seemed impressed. He
                            agreed that from international aspect, he should do so. Intense emotion
                            of Greeks in Cyprus and Greece presented difficulties for him internally
                            but he declared he would do everything he could.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether Grivas could be persuaded to leave Cyprus. He said Grivas
                            would not leave while many of his followers were in prison under long
                            sentences. I said British would probably grant amnesty in natural course
                            of events when they were convinced by experience that return to
                            terrorism was unlikely. He agreed, but said he would not persuade Grivas
                            to leave unless Grivas had fairly definite assurance regarding amnesty,
                            since otherwise his followers would feel betrayed. I said I would try to
                            find out whether there were any possibilities regarding amnesty.</p>

                                to this telegram, the Department informed the Embassy that it agreed
                                with <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>’s suggestion that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should present
                                himself as a “man of peace”. The Department added that it believed

                                further progress on the Cyprus issue. The Department suggested to
                                the Embassy that it might wish to inform the Greek Government that
                                prospects for progress on self-government for Cyprus might depend on

                        <p>3594. Rome for <persName corresp="#p_MSJM1">McSweeney</persName>. During
                            talk with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> today I urged
                            him to make statement favorable towards Turks of Cyprus. He said Turkish
                            Cypriots had been almost as violent as Turks in Ankara in condemning
                            Greece for welcoming him to Athens. Nevertheless, he asserted he would
                            try his best to placate Turks of Cyprus. I expressed view that best way
                            to defeat partition would be for Cypriot Turks to show they were
                            opposed. He expressed confidence they would do so after period of
                            self-government. I asked if he planned to make counter proposals to
                            Radcliffe constitution. He said he had plans which he would bring
                            forward at appropriate moment.</p>
                        <p>When I urged him to visit London, he said he planned to go but not at
                            present because under existing atmosphere he would be castigated in
                            London as terrorist. I said he could remove this danger by convincing
                            evidence that he is man of peace.</p>

                            Turkish reaction.</p>

                            about the Cyprus situation now than at any time since his arrival in
                            Ankara. (Telegram 2487, April 29; Department of State, Central Files,

                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> session Averoff visited me for half an
                            hour to discuss Cyprus….</p>
                        <p>He said Greek Government is now contemplating two possible solutions of
                            Cyprus problem. First would be creation of independent state and he
                            expressed his deep conviction that Greece would accept guaranteed
                            independence. He also said Greece would hold elections, placing issue
                            squarely up to electorate which would leave no doubt as to Greek
                            willingness to go through with such solution. Second solution he cited
                            was possible creation of trusteeship. He referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> proposal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> re United States trusteeship. He
                            realized this not feasible and suggested that some <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country such as Norway might be asked
                            to accept it. He said United Kingdom would be in position to keep its
                            bases on Cyprus and could call on United Nations to arrange such
                            trusteeship.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on second solution Secretary said Greek Government should turn
                            such a proposal over to someone like <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> to present and not present it as a Greek proposal.
                            Secretary said heretofore trusteeships have been established with view
                            to eventual self-government and independence and presumably trusteeship
                            over Cyprus would have to be established on different basis. Averoff
                            said that Greek Government could never agree to permanent trusteeship
                            and could not exclude forever right of Cypriots to determine their <pb
                                n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0513"/>future He thought it might be
                            possible to express trusteeship in terms of a minimum period of 20 years
                            or so. Averoff said in any case he preferred first solution, i.e.,
                            independence and was obviously seeking United States support for this
                            solution. Secretary remarked Turks are opposed to independence because
                            they fear it will lead to ultimate enosis. Secretary did not commit
                            himself to either solution but suggested Averoff pursue question of
                            trusteeship through third party. Secretary felt that any solution
                            acceptable to Greece and Turkey would also be acceptable to United
                            Kingdom. Averoff asked that his views re solution Cyprus be closely held
                            since, he said, only Prime Minister and King in Greece have knowledge of
                            these views.</p>

                                problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">The “oral communication,” dated
                                July 24, not printed, proposed a plan in which Great Britain would
                                invite representatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments to a
                                conference in London in September. According to the plan, the United
                                States and Secretary General Spaak would be invited as observers.
                                The conference would have no fixed agenda and might discuss “without
                                prejudice every solution so far mooted.” The “only fixed
                                requirement[s]” the British plan proposed, on which any solution
                                must be based, were: essential military facilities under British
                                control; protection of the island from Communist infiltration; and
                                ensuring peace of the island. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                                747C.00/7–2457)</note>…</p>
                        <p>In leaving this document, the Ambassador made the following supplemental
                            remarks. The Cyprus problem had now entered a critical stage and it was
                            of the utmost importance that efforts be undertaken speedily to arrive
                            at a compromise solution. The present United Kingdom approach was
                            prompted by the belief that it was necessary first to arrive at an
                            agreement on the ultimate status of the island; within that framework
                            the internal problems of self-rule <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484"
                                facs="0514"/>could then be negotiated with the Cypriots. In the
                            past, the problem of self-rule had been approached first; these efforts
                            had failed, in part because of Greek Government support of the Greek
                            Cypriots; there was, therefore, more hope for effective self-rule
                            negotiations with the Cypriots if the Greek Government first became a
                            party to an agreement on the ultimate status. The Ambassador emphasized
                            the importance of United States influence and expressed the hope that we
                            would use this not only to get the parties together for the proposed
                            meeting but to have them approach the meeting with a reasonable spirit
                            of compromise. This was particularly important in the case of the
                            Greeks, who undoubtedly would not attend without United States
                            encouragement. No public announcement concerning the meeting was
                            intended and the proposed discussions with the Greek and the Turkish
                            Governments would be on a confidential basis. It was the United
                            Kingdom’s hope that the time between now and the meeting in September
                            could be used to consider carefully with the United States the various
                            possible solutions. In that connection he expressed the hope that these
                            discussions might be held in London. He also pointed out that after the
                            Suez experience the “essential military facilities” mentioned in the
                            document would now be quite small and should present no problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the United Kingdom plan would be studied by the
                            Department. He asked if there was any reason to hope that the Greeks
                            would attend, recalled the past Greek attitude toward such a meeting,
                            and observed that it probably would be very difficult for the United
                            States to prevail upon Greece to participate without assurances of
                            support that we were not in a position to give because of the interests
                            of our Turkish ally in this same problem. The Secretary also noted the
                            importance of there being no public announcement about this plan and
                            took under advisement the suggestion that the proposed United
                            States–United Kingdom discussions be held in London.</p>

                            conference with an “open but not empty mind”. Regarding the question of

                            see the conference postponed as it would “almost certainly” aggravate an
                            already bad situation. Instead it suggested that the British, with
                            assistance from the United States and <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName>, should continue to press forward with secret

                        <p>In telegram 283 from Ankara, August 1, the Embassy noted, regarding
                            paragraph 6 (a) of Tosec 7, that it believed the advantages to be gained
                            from United States attendance at the proposed conference as an observer
                            outweighed the disadvantages. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                            tripartite meeting that “we will be obliged either to press Greeks to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> noted that the Joint

                                >NSC</gloss> 5718.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether this was not an unusual type of paper for the
                            National Security Council to consider. It appeared to him that the
                            courses of action in the Cyprus Supplement consisted mostly of things
                            the Department of State should do, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> said the Cyprus Supplement had been prepared
                            primarily for the information of the Council. The Planning Board had
                            felt it was difficult to talk about Greece without any mention of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then pointed out that
                            there was a difference of opinion in the Planning Board on paragraph 12
                            of the Supplement, relating to U.S. participation in arrangements
                            guaranteeing the interim or eventual status of Cyprus. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> said that it was
                            conceivable that a guarantee arrangement might be concluded some time in
                            the future, especially if the United States would participate. <pb
                                n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0519"/>State was not asking that the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> now approve U.S. participation
                            in a guarantee, but had suggested paragraph 12 of the Supplement in
                            order to alert the Council to the problem. He said State would be
                            prepared to amend the wording of the paragraph so that the phrase “be
                            prepared to give serious consideration to participating” would replace
                            the phrase “be prepared to participate”.</p>

                                countries. I said we might urge the Greeks to attend but only if we
                                were absolutely convinced that there was no side deal between the UK

                            risk news may reach Greek government from other quarter and Athens may

                                <item>While we are interested in UK thinking, we feel that it is
                                    still premature to define UNGA tactics and also feel that any
                                    negotiation concerning either our tactics or position at UNGA
                                    should be avoided. We continue to believe solution of the Cyprus
                                    problem is to be found through quiet diplomacy rather than
                                    through public forums and that our UNGA tactics should be
                                    directed to those ends. This will require US to maintain maximum
                                    tactical flexibility. Generally speaking we should endeavor to
                                    avoid discussions and forestall resolution that would prejudice
                                    prospect for future negotiations or provide basis for increased
                                    Soviet Bloc or Afro-Asian bloc involvement in Cyprus. In view
                                    absence any significant progress toward solution since last UNGA
                                    resolution, we recognize it may be difficult to forestall
                                    resolution calling for specific solution either in direction of
                                    interim arrangements or ultimate status.</item>

                        <p>Between September 10 and 18, representatives of the United States, led by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BW1">Walworth Barbour</persName>, and
                            representatives of the United Kingdom, led by Sir Frederick Hoyer
                            Millar, held secret and informal discussions in London on the Cyprus
                            problem. British officials expressed their willingness to withdraw from
                            Cyprus provided that Britain maintain sovereignty over certain military
                            facilities on the island. Various proposals were also examined for both
                            an interim and a long-term solution to the problem of the status of
                            Cyprus. Both a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> trusteeship and
                            guaranteed independence were given serious consideration. The British
                            representatives believed, however, that the best solution to the problem
                            might be a condominium in which the United Kingdom, Greece, and Turkey
                            would share responsibility for that part of the island not retained for
                            British military installations. According to the tentative plan, Cyprus
                            would be administered by a governor selected by the three governments
                            concerned. Self-government would be based on a constitution. The United
                            States representatives, on instructions from the Department of State,
                            agreed that the British proposal had merit and was worth pursuing.
                            British and American representatives agreed that as a next step the
                            British might suggest their proposal to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                condominium: (1) At first sight condominium appears to be interim
                                arrangement. Do British in fact envisage its continuing
                                indefinitely? How will time element be defined to Greeks and Turks?
                                (2) Are British aware Turks have mentioned condominium off and on
                                over past several years and might not apparent British adoption Turk
                                    <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> militate against its
                                acceptance by Greeks? <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. It
                                appears likely British have in fact already discussed this with
                                Turks. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In any event we
                                would hope for time being British would discourage Turks from
                                publicly supporting condominium. (3) How would condominium’s sponsor
                                reassure Greeks they would not be outvoted by UK and Turks within
                                condominium. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In event UK Labor
                                Party comes into power condominium might offer more opportunities
                                for ultimate solution favorable to Greece. Greeks might not
                                therefore reject condominium out of hand. End <gloss

                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> role and relationship in
                                establishing condominium, adjudicating disputes, and providing for

                                to Turks, for present at least. Condominium or some other type of
                                interim arrangement (also perhaps involving <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>) might provide useful cooling off period that
                                would enable Greeks and Turks to get together in time on ultimate

                                would result. Immediate independence under some sort of tutelage
                                partakes character of self-government and might better be considered

                        <p>On July 12, 1957, Greece submitted for the fourth time “Question of

                            the General Assembly. The Greek item has two parts: (a) “Application,
                            under the auspices of the United Nations, of the principle of equal
                            rights and self-determination in the case of the population of the
                            island of Cyprus” (the same formulation as in the Greek proposals in
                            1954, 1955 and 1956); and (b) “Violation of human rights and atrocities
                            by the British colonial administration against the Cypriots”.</p>

                                    among those parties concerned—Greece, the UK and Turkey. It
                                    should state its belief that there are various possible
                                    solutions which would protect the interests of the parties and

                                <p>(b) The United States should seek to exercise a moderating
                                    influence on the parties involved. In particular, it should urge
                                    the parties not to press any resolution which would prejudge the

                                    or which would in other ways make more difficult the renewal of

                                    of a compromise resolution acceptable to the parties directly

                        <p>In 1954 the General Assembly, by a vote of 49 (US, Greece, UK,
                            Turkey)–0–11, adopted a resolution according to which it decided not to
                            consider the item further. In 1955 the Assembly refused to inscribe the
                            Greek item on Cyprus by a vote of 28–22–10, the US opposing inscription.
                            This action reflected the conviction that “quiet diplomacy” offered a
                            better prospect for the successful conclusion of the then current
                            negotiations between the UK and Greece than General Assembly discussion.
                            In 1956 both the United Kingdom and Greece submitted items on Cyprus,
                            and both were included in the agenda without objection or formal vote.
                            The Greek proposal called for self-determination for Cyprus and the
                            British proposal was entitled “Support from Greece for terrorism in
                            Cyprus”. On February 27, 1957, the General Assembly adopted an Indian
                            compromise resolution which “expressed the earnest desire that a
                            peaceful, <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0535"/>democratic and just
                            solution will be found, in accordance with the purposes and principles
                            of the Charter of the United Nations, and the hope that negotiations
                            will be resumed and continued to this end”. The United States supported
                            this resolution.</p>
                        <p>While the situation on Cyprus and Anglo-Greek relations have improved
                            somewhat, there have been no further direct negotiations. Greece took
                            the position that the 11th <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution
                            required negotiations between the British and the Cypriots, while the
                            United Kingdom contended that the resolution was intended to cover not
                            only such negotiations but also negotiations among the three governments
                            concerned, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>However, some progress has been made. The British Government has released
                            Archbishop Makarios from his exile in the Seychelles Islands, and
                            violence on Cyprus has largely subsided. The Secretary General of <gloss

                                Henri Spaak</persName>, offered his good offices to the three
                            governments concerned but has so far been unsuccessful in bringing about
                            a resumption of negotiations under the aegis of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Meantime there has been a helpful modification of the British position.
                            The United Kingdom has expressed a willingness to surrender its
                            sovereignty over Cyprus if a mutually acceptable solution can be reached
                            and has reduced its minimum conditions to (1) essential military
                            facilities to remain under British sovereignty, (2) protection of Cyprus
                            from Communist infiltration, and (3) establishment of peace and
                            tranquillity on the island as a whole. Greece now appears willing to
                            consider “guaranteed independence” or dominion status for Cyprus. Turkey
                            continues to favor partition but might shift its position in the absence
                            of British support.</p>
                        <p>In August the United Kingdom through diplomatic channels proposed a
                            tripartite conference including the three governments, with the United
                            States and M. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> to attend in
                            the capacity of observers. The British proposal contemplates a
                            conference on the ultimate status of the island. There would be no fixed
                            agenda. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> immediately agreed
                            to attend as an observer, and later the United States reluctantly
                            concurred. Turkey reacted favorably but indicated it could not attend
                            the conference until after the Turkish elections which are scheduled for
                            October 27. Greece rejected the British proposal but qualified its
                            answer in such a way as to permit reconsideration of its position.
                            Moreover, at British initiative arrangements have been made for secret
                            informal talks in London between the United Kingdom and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The United States continues to believe that the best prospect for a
                            satisfactory solution lies in quiet diplomacy involving direct
                            negotiations among the parties. Debate of the item in the General
                            Assembly would probably not be helpful and could exacerbate the <pb
                                n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0536"/>existing situation.
                            Consequently, the United States should seek to exercise a moderating
                            influence on any debate in the General Assembly in the hope of
                            facilitating a return to direct negotiations and should encourage
                            others, such as India, to do likewise. It is clear that Greece is
                            determined to press the question of Cyprus in the General Assembly in
                            the hope that discussion there will strengthen its own position in any
                            future negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of the Cyprus question prior to or concurrently with the
                            Turkish elections would only serve to make the Turkish position at the
                            Assembly more inflexible and to inflame popular passions in Turkey. It
                            would therefore be desirable to delay substantive discussion of the
                            issue until after the Turkish elections.</p>

                                    them excited so the issue is considered to be Greek-Turkish and
                                    not Greek-British. The Pres. said Cyprus never belonged to

                            persuade <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> to advocate a
                            particular solution before exploratory talks on his part.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, we are not sufficiently convinced of the merits of any of them
                            to do so. We believe that condominium plan as outlined to us presents
                            serious problems of which the greatest would be question of where
                            ultimate authority lies in event dispute between co-domini or crisis on
                            Island. Even assuming that Governor had unusual ability, he would need
                            either strong support from co-domini or general acceptance by both Greek
                            and Turkish Cypriots of his administration. Former would be unlikely
                            since it should be assumed Greece and Turkey, as co-domini, likely be in
                            disagreement; latter would take time and great skill. Our London talks
                            have shown other suggested solutions also present difficulties.</p>
                        <p>We do not wish to rule out these solutions and are mindful <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s comments on them but believe that
                            there is a greater <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0539"/>likelihood
                            of progress if we concentrate more attention on devising an acceptable
                            procedure for the transmission of views between the parties.</p>
                        <p>This leads to our second reason for not wishing urge a particular
                            solution on <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. We continue
                            believe <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> can play useful
                            mediatory role as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. However, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> has already attempted persuade
                            parties of merits of a particular solution (guaranteed independence)
                            without success. Also, most solutions thus far proposed are considered
                            as having originated with one of parties and thus less likely be
                            acceptable to others. Acceptable solution more likely be blend of
                            present proposals. We believe <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> might more usefully adopt general method of
                            collecting views of U.K., Greece, and Turkey in separate talks without
                            championing any particular solution and seek gradually find basis for
                            common understanding on an interim arrangement. This would take time but
                            we believe time is necessary element any progress this question. We
                            would like to speak to <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            about the London talks if no serious objection is perceived as soon as
                            possible and also give our views along the foregoing lines. We would, of
                            course, fully inform <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> of this
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>We think this would be more in line with <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of negotiations
                            without agenda and hence less apt to frighten off Greeks or Turks.
                            However, we are frankly not sanguine about the possible success of a
                            London meeting of the three powers which could not avoid publicity and
                            are thus more inclined favor secret separate talks in Paris, where all
                            three countries well represented.</p>
                        <p>We intend explore this promptly with <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> because we would hope that after careful
                            preparation such talks could be started soon.</p>
                        <p>In general we believe Cyprus question less tense than last year but that
                            nevertheless on international plane agreement on a final solution
                            unlikely now. We feel it more realistic expect that months of serious
                            effort will be needed to reach international understanding on some
                            interim arrangement. For this reason we urge <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> consider taking series small but concrete steps on
                            Cyprus itself to give Cypriots greater participation their own affairs.
                            Preferably there should be no advance publicity or discussions which
                            usually bring automatic critical response. This would help relieve local
                            tensions on Island while secret international talks in progress. These
                            might include some elements Radcliffe proposals but without so
                            designating them.</p>

                            pointed out that the Greeks have become more obdurate since the Cyprus
                            resolution adopted by the Labor Party Conference.<note n="3"

                            they could get the parties concerned around a table, eventually they
                            would come to agree on some compromise which everyone could accept. In
                            this context they had developed the tridominium concept, not expecting
                            that it would be accepted to begin with but that it might be useful as
                            an eventual <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0541"/>compromise. He
                            noted that at first the US officials appeared to like the <gloss
                                target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> but that now we seemed to feel it has
                            disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we were not so much concerned over the
                            disadvantages of the plan as with its practicability. He did not think
                            that the Greeks could accept it because it would give the Turks a legal
                            status on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary said that the British would be in a state of
                            suspended animation regarding the Cyprus problem until after the Turkish
                            elections. He noted that there would be a thirty-day gap between these
                            elections and the date when the Cyprus item is scheduled for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate in December, during which time he
                            hoped fruitful discussions might take place. He believed that the Greeks
                            will probably start a campaign about November first to get Britain’s
                            friends to bring pressure to bear on the UK in preparation for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LSJSB1">Lloyd</persName> observed that the present
                            situation on the island is precarious and that terrorism could start
                            again at any moment. He stated that the British could no longer, in
                            terms of money or manpower, afford to keep the same number of troops on
                            Cyprus as <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> had had to
                            suppress terrorism and that a reduction will take place phased over the
                            next three to four years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ECB1">Elbrick</persName> said that Mr.

                            something to say on the Cyprus question when he comes later this

                        <p>For many reasons including especially Turkish elections, there have been
                            relatively few discussions in recent months with leaders of Turkish
                            Government on Cyprus problem. All public statements reveal Turkey
                            holding rigidly to partition of island between Greece and Turkey as only
                            acceptable alternative (other than Turkish annexation) to status
                            quo.</p>
                        <p>It is clear to Department that Turkey considers its readiness to accept
                            partition as evidence of its willingness to make concessions. Yet it is
                            equally clear that outright partition as solution presents such
                            difficulties (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2416<note n="5"

                            sincerely desire solution must carefully study variants thereof or other

                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> solidarity, we believe Turkish
                            Government will recognize need for Turkish concessions as well as
                            concessions by all other interested parties to achieve lasting solution
                            to this problem and thus contribute to peace in eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly Department desires Embassy Ankara to take advantage of
                            appropriate opportunities to impress upon Turkish Government at high

                            prospects poor for either enosis or outright partition and with need
                            great for some solution, those who wish to solve problem must consider
                            seriously other interim or long-term solutions in spirit that recognizes

                            sake of common interests are seeking to assist in solutions.</p>

                        <p>The Greek Foreign Minister opened his discussion with the Secretary today
                            by extensive remarks on the Middle East designed apparently to show that
                            the Greeks were good allies in a crisis, …</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> then turned to the one subject upon
                            which, he <hi rend="strong">said</hi>, all others depend—Cyprus. He felt
                            the situation in recent months was both better and worse. It was better
                            because the British attitude had clearly improved and the British had
                            now shown themselves ready to accept a “quite logical solution to the
                            problem”. The situation was worse because there seemed to be a new
                            “intransigence” on the part of Turkey and there were prospects of a
                            resumption of fighting in Cyprus itself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> emphasized that the Greek people now
                            realized that <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the United Kingdom but Turkey
                            stood in the way of a solution of the Cyprus problem. He remarked that
                            the British Ambassador in Athens had even said that he, the Ambassador,
                            had started to become popular. Averoff said that there had been a period
                            of calm on Cyprus which had developed particularly “because we have fed
                            the people with hopes”. Now, with hopes still unrealized, the Cypriots
                            might become discouraged. Moreover, the Turks on Cyprus were armed. “If
                            fighting starts”, he said, “between Greeks and and Turkish Cypriots, I
                            must forecast that Greek-Turkish relations will be broken. I will not do
                            it myself. I will resign first, but the street will do it.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister added that the Greek Government had mobilized “all
                            our imaginations to find a solution”. Tension goes on, where will it
                            lead? What can we do?</p>
                        <p>Turning to the UNGA, the Foreign Minister remarked that he had made a
                            proposal to the British. While he was under strong <pb n="515"
                                xml:id="pg_515" facs="0545"/>pressure to push for a resolution in
                            favor of self-determination, he would try to break the least possible
                            number of windows. He had suggested, therefore, that the British make a
                            declaration at the UNGA (1) indicating that they would cancel the
                            deportation of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, (2)
                            saying that the Government of Cyprus would start negotiations with the
                            representatives of the people of Cyprus—both Greeks and Turks—regarding
                            the future of the island. If the British would make such a declaration
                            he would agree to a resolution which took note of the substance of this
                            and would not press for his own resolution on self-determination. (<hi

                        <p>The Foreign Minister reported that the British in New York appeared
                            sympathetic towards this proposal and had referred it to London. He was
                            hopeful that this might lead to a satisfactory arrangement at the
                            General Assembly.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In concluding his presentation, he said that be wished to request of the
                            Secretary that the United States agree not to block his resolution on
                            self-determination if the United Kingdom did not accept his compromise
                            proposal. He added that he was convinced that one day the British
                            Government would apply self-determination to Cyprus—if not under the
                            Conservative Party, certainly under the Labor Party. “How,” he asked,
                            “can other countries impede what the British will one day apply?”</p>
                        <p>In response to the Foreign Minister, the Secretary started to comment
                            first on what Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> had to say about the
                            Middle East. Averoff stopped him, saying he was more interested in what
                            the Secretary would say about Cyprus. The Secretary then referred to the
                            British Labor Party’s statement on Cyprus to which Averoff had alluded.
                            The Secretary noted that one must not base one’s hopes too much upon
                            what a party out of power might say, since parties are known to change
                            their minds when they assume power and responsibility. He then observed
                            that Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> had omitted any mention of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s name in his talk. Mr.
                                <persName>Averoff</persName> replied that he would, of course, be
                            glad to talk of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> if the
                            Secretary wished. The Secretary then mentioned the overriding importance
                            of a solution from the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> standpoint,
                            and said that he hoped that a solution could be reached in quiet
                            diplomacy such as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had
                            undertaken. Accordingly we would not wish to see anything happen in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which might hurt the efforts in
                            quiet diplomacy. The <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0546"/>Secretary
                            added that we did not think a United Nations resolution would resolve
                            the problem. In respect to Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName>’s specific
                            question as to whether we would support a resolution on
                            self-determination, he said that we could not commit ourselves in
                            advance to support a resolution which we have not seen. However, it
                            seemed that the most desirable result would be for the Greeks to work
                            out something with the British. Meanwhile, we would have to reserve our
                            position. The Secretary further noted that Averoff had told him, when
                            they last met in September,<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d264">Document 264</ref>.</note> that the Greeks would
                            do nothing to generate animosity in Cyprus. The Greek Foreign Minister
                            took leave of the Secretary saying that he would continue his discussion
                            in greater detail with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"

                        <p>We believe that the best way to bring Greece and Turkey closer together
                            on the Cyprus problem is through the efforts of Mr. <persName

                                >Karamanlis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> to undertake a frank exchange of views.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> will seek to do this.
                            We should also do all we can to help effect bilateral exchanges on the
                            Cyprus dispute at Paris, between the parties concerned and between each
                            of them and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The British are unlikely to undertake any new departure in Cyprus until

                            least six weeks. As soon as this is done, we would hope that we may

                            share your concern about the bad effect this controversy <pb n="521"
                                xml:id="pg_521" facs="0551"/>is having on the North Atlantic
                            Alliance. I agree that some way has to be found to bring the Greeks and
                            Turks closer together.</p>
                        <p>I have already tried to persuade both the Greeks and the Turks to
                            restrain themselves in the debates of the United Nations General
                            Assembly because, as you say, bitter debate there would make a solution
                            more difficult and could further interfere with the working of our
                            Alliance. I also have urged the Greek Government to keep E.O.K.A. from
                            further violence.</p>
                        <p>You probably know that the United States is supporting Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s efforts to find some common
                            ground between the Turkish and Greek positions in the hope that these
                            efforts may contribute to some solution. During the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting in Paris we will encourage
                            the Greeks and the Turks to talk to each other directly.</p>
                        <p>After the new Governor has had a chance to look over conditions on the
                            Island and make his report to London, I think it might be worthwhile for
                            us to go over with the British Government possible lines of action to
                            see if there are ways in which we can further support Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>’s effort and encourage the Greeks
                            and Turks to make the sort of concessions of which you speak.</p>
                        <p>As I am sure you know I am ready to do whatever is right to do to bring
                            an end to this quarrel.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to seeing you in a few days.</p>

                        <p>On December 12, during discussion at the Secretary’s Staff meeting, the
                            subject of the Cyprus issue at the United Nations was raised. According
                            to the notes of the meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> reported

                                    last night moved for adjournment of the vote on the Cyprus
                                    resolution, which <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>had
                                    been expected to pass in Committee by a small majority. Certain
                                    amendments were expected and there was also the alternative of
                                    introducing a new resolution which would eliminate the reference
                                    to self-determination and which would indicate that some
                                    progress had been made since the last resolution. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> expected the Greek

                                    a vote in its present form, the US would have to abstain.

                        <p>Later that day by a vote of 33 to 20 with 25 abstentions, among them the
                            United States, the First Committee of the United Nations General
                            Assembly adopted a resolution on Cyprus. (U.N. Doc. A/ 3794) The
                            approved text of the resolution, which noted the importance of having
                            the principle of self-determination applied in the case of Cyprus, was
                            based on a Greek subamendment to a four-power amendment to the operative
                            part of the original Greek draft resolution. The operative part of the
                            amended resolution reads: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said that he wanted
                            to invite the President’s attention to the problem of Cyprus. It was
                            having very unfortunate repercussions in the Balkan Pact and in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The solution was simple—Cyprus
                            should either be independent or Greek. In either circumstance, it would
                            be with the United Nations and a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>; Greece was prepared to give guarantees concerning the
                            Turkish minority.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that all problems become difficult when emotions
                            are involved. He knew that Cyprus was not an easy problem for Greece.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> declared that
                            Greece had a moral obligation to support the Greeks on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought the UK was now more flexible on this
                            problem and would support any arrangement that Greece and Turkey agreed
                            on. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> wondered whether the UK was sincere
                            in this and the President stated his strong conviction, based on his
                            long friendship with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName>, that the UK was indeed sincere.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would be very happy to see Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> get together on Cyprus, to see
                            if within an atmosphere of flexibility they could agree on
                            something.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said that for 2½
                            years he had endured a series of provocations connected with Cyprus. He
                            referred to the riots in Istanbul and Izmir and to “unfriendly” British
                            moves. An anti-Western feeling was being built up in Greece because of
                            Cyprus. Whereas only 10 per cent of the Greek population is Communist, a
                            Popular Front had now been established. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said that despite all this, he continued to
                            steer a pro-West policy but he was constantly being attacked because the
                            West was against Greece on <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0554"
                            />Cyprus. “You all vote against us in the United Nations,” he said.
                            …</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether Turkey or Greece couldn’t sit down with a
                            third, neutral, person to work out an agreement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> reiterated that the solution
                            was a simple one. He added that if a neutral person became involved, it
                            should be the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName>, in discussing the Turkish minority,
                            said that Greece had in mind that a committee of neutrals would fix the
                            status of the minority. This status would then be put under the
                            guarantee of the United Nations, which would have a Commissioner on
                            Cyprus for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether Cyprus, if independent, could survive
                            economically. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said it could.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the Greeks had proposed their solution
                            directly to the Turks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said there had been no direct contact but
                            that the Turks were aware of the Greek position. Turkey is opposed to
                            the union of Cyprus with Greece, he added, A <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> guarantee against this should prevent such union. …</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the geography of the situation worries the
                            Turks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> replied that
                            there would be no security problem if Cyprus were independent or
                            controlled by Greece, a small power. Cyprus under UK control was more
                            dangerous to Turkey because the UK is a big power and some day might not
                            be friendly to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The President stressed his concern over the damage being done to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> by the Greek-Turkish dispute over
                            Cyprus. He thought Cyprus should not be allowed to prevent Greece and
                            Turkey from being allies in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He
                            noted that Cyprus had even caused the destruction of the American
                            Library in Athens, despite our vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, which we understood had pleased the Greeks. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said he was sorry
                            about this. He believed the Communists might have done it.</p>

                        <p>The President said that the Turkish Prime Minister was coming to see him
                            shortly and that he would suggest to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> that Turkey should be as flexible as possible
                            and that Greece and Turkey might meet to discuss Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said that Turkey
                            desired partition of Cyprus but that this was not a logical or practical
                                <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss>, since 82 per cent of the
                            population is Greek. The Turks are too intransigent, he thought.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would be willing to do personally anything he
                            thought would help. Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said that the US is
                            the only country that can persuade Turkey to be “reasonable”. The <pb
                                n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>President made clear that we
                            had not espoused any particular Cyprus solution. We did not believe we
                            should use pressure on either side. We would urge flexibility and the
                            possible use of a neutral party. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said that he was grateful that the US had
                            made clear that it is not against Greece.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the US was trying to keep strong the alliance
                            against Communism. We are trying to promote agreements among the many
                            friends we have in cases where these friends are in dispute. We often
                            think it is better to abstain in votes on these problems and thus
                            maintain our influence and ability to play a useful role.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said that
                            something had to be done to solve the Cyprus problem. Because of it
                            Greece was in conflict with its allies and because of it it was hard for
                            the Greek Government to oppose the Communists at home. The US must
                            intervene decisively. The Greek solution would meet the interests of
                            Greece, Turkey, the UK and the Cypriot population. Greece was willing to
                            give guarantees regarding the latter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether Greece was working with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> said that he had talked with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0556"/>yesterday and that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> agreed that partition
                            was no solution. He favored a solution on the basis of independence.
                            …</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said that the US was the only power
                            which could bring about a solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1"
                                >Spaak</persName> had said that the UK was willing to accept
                            independence for Cyprus, but not Turkey. That was why Greece was asking
                            for US help in connection with the problem of the Turkish attitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> was sure that next
                            year a majority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would vote for
                            independence for Cyprus. He said that he was in severe trouble at home
                            over Cyprus, facing eight opposition parties, the Communists, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and the Cypriots. …</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could understand why Greece felt it had to bring
                            the Cyprus matter before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We did
                            not think the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could solve it, and it
                            was for this reason that we were not sympathetic to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approach, not because of our views on the
                            merits of the Greek position. Emotional forces made a solution
                            difficult. The Secretary told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> that he admired how he had conducted himself
                            in the face of domestic political pressures. We recognized him as a real
                            friend of the US, and we were trying to be a real friend of Greece. This
                            did not mean, however, that we would do what we thought was wrong—to
                            coerce another friendly country. We did not use our aid programs in this
                            way. Furthermore, we had no mandate to settle the Cyprus problem, not
                            that we were asking for one. We would like to help, but we could only do
                            so through appeal to reason on both sides. The Secretary thought that if
                            all the parties would put down what they wanted and why they wanted it,
                            the “whys” could be reconciled.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            had a mandate of sorts to reconcile differences between <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. We were prepared to
                            encourage him.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> stated that just
                            a display of interest with Turkey would be helpful. The Secretary
                            replied that the President spoke with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> yesterday about Cyprus and that
                            he, the Secretary, was going to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> that very afternoon after his appointment with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that Cyprus was the last part of Europe under
                            colonial rule. This was intolerable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Averoff</persName> said the Secretary should tell Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> that partition is
                            something rejected by everybody but Turkey. He should be made to be less
                            sticky on this. Greece, for example, had proposed three or four possible
                            approaches. Greece badly wanted the re-establishment of good relations
                            with Turkey in order to be able better to withstand the pressure of the
                            Slavs on the East Mediterranean.</p>

                            <item>Greece has seldom enjoyed real political and economic stability
                                and remains handicapped by its poverty of natural resources and by
                                the volatility of a political system in which foreign influences
                                still play an important part. Since World War II, however, Greece
                                has with US and UK assistance crushed the Communist effort to seize
                                power through force, repaired the tremendous damage brought about by
                                the war, and made a start toward building up the economy. Moreover,
                                since the installation of Premier <persName corresp="#p_PMA1"
                                    >Papagos</persName> in 1952, the Greek Government has had a
                                degree of popular support and political effectiveness unusual since
                                World War I. (paras. 9–11)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>So long as <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> retains
                                active leadership, we believe that the present Greek Rally
                                government will remain in power at least up to the 1956 elections.
                                Although some deterioration of the Rally’s cohesiveness and prestige
                                has recently taken place, probably presaging an increase in
                                political intrigue, and some decline in the government’s strength
                                and effectiveness, it is unlikely that sufficient Rally deputies
                                will defect to overturn <persName corresp="#p_PMA1"
                                    >Papagos</persName>’ now comfortable majority. On the basis of
                                present indications, if <persName corresp="#p_PMA1"
                                    >Papagos</persName> is still active and on the political scene,
                                the Rally will probably win the 1956 elections, though as compared
                                with its showing in 1952 it will inevitably suffer some loss of
                                electoral strength, (paras. 21, 23)</item>

                            <item>If <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName>, who is now 72,
                                should die or become incapacitated, the Rally would soon fall apart,
                                and the centrist Liberal Party would replace it as the strongest
                                political grouping. Since even the Liberals would lack a
                                parliamentary majority in their own right and would probably be
                                unable to gain one in new elections, the eventual outcome would
                                probably be a series of unstable coalition governments, marked by
                                political fragmentation and an increase both in Palace influence and
                                in Communist opportunities for political maneuver. Under such
                                circumstances, there might be an attempt at dictatorship by the
                                secret military society, <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss>,
                                although this would depend to a large degree on <gloss

                            <item>The Greek economy will probably remain fairly stable over the next
                                three or four years despite a decline in US aid; some modest
                                improvements in production and in Greece’s foreign exchange position
                                may take place. In the longer term it is improbable that a
                                politically acceptable standard of living can be maintained without
                                some form of economic assistance unless there is a reduction in
                                Greece’s contribution to its defense budget. (paras. 29, 30)</item>

                            <item>Regardless of internal political developments, Greece’s strongly
                                pro-Western orientation is unlikely to change over the next few
                                years. The US in particular is likely to retain its present

                                Greece, although Greek responsiveness to US advice may decline
                                somewhat as a result of the progressive reduction of US aid and the
                                US position on enosis (union of Cyprus with Greece). (paras.

                            <item>The British are seeking to restore their influence in Greek
                                internal affairs. While they share the basic US interest in
                                maintaining a stable, non-Communist Greece, they also desire to
                                protect their special interests and influences. They desire a Greek
                                Government more amenable to their influence than the present one and
                                have been particularly irritated by <persName corresp="#p_PMA1"
                                    >Papagos</persName>’ advocacy of enosis. (para. 17)</item>

                            <item>Although the enosis issue is likely to be a continuing irritant in
                                Greek relations with the UK, Turkey, and the US, it is unlikely that
                                Greece’s alliances with these powers will be strained by this or any
                                other issue. Greek relations with its non-Satellite neighbors will
                                probably continue to improve slowly, though underlying suspicions
                                and conflicts of interest will remain, (paras. 46, 47)</item>

                                satisfactorily with continuing US training and material assistance,
                                and the Balkan Alliance military planning has made satisfactory
                                progress. <note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">On August 9, the Foreign
                                    Ministers of Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia signed the Treaty of
                                    Alliance, Political Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance at Bled,
                                    Yugoslavia. The agreement, which supplemented a February 25,
                                    1953, Treaty of Friendship and Collaboration, was often referred
                                    to as the Treaty of Bled, the Balkan Pact, or Balkan Alliance,
                                    and sought primarily to guarantee the territorial integrity and
                                    political independence of the member states. The accord entered
                                    into force upon final ratification by the three parties on May
                                    15, 1955. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Documents</hi>

                        </list>
                        <p>Last spring it was decided to increase Greece’s economic aid for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 from $15 to $25 million in order to
                            maintain Greek ground forces at 105,000. <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1"
                                >USCINCEUR</gloss> recommended strongly that the Greek ground forces
                            be kept at a minimum of 100,000 while the Greek Government indicated
                            clearly that, if Greece received only $15 million in economic aid, it
                            would be compelled to reduce the ground forces to 70,000.</p>
                        <p>It is now proposed to reduce Greek economic aid to $15 million for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956, and if this is done the same
                            problem will recur. As explained below the Greek Government could obtain
                            no popular or political support for an increase in its defense budget to
                            compensate for decreased United States aid. Therefore the almost certain
                            result of decreased economic assistance would be a decrease in the Greek
                            armed forces. If the Greek ground forces are reduced 30,000 below the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> minimum, other <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members may be influenced to make
                            corresponding reductions in their own forces.</p>
                        <p>Greece is one of the countries which has not reduced its defense
                            expenditures. It has continued to devote about 40 percent of its budget
                            to defense despite strong internal pressures. These pressures have their
                            origin in the fact that Greece has a per capita income of only $158
                            compared to an average of $600–800 for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries of Western Europe. United States economic
                            assistance has shown the Greeks how to make substantial increases in
                            their standard of living, and they have made economic development a
                            national objective. They understand that expenditure for investment in
                            development projects is necessary for improved levels of living, and no
                                <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0561"/>Greek Government could
                            successfully withstand the demand for further progress. The communists
                            have gauged this situation accurately and for some time they have taken
                            the line that America seeks only to increase the Greek defense burden at
                            the expense of any improvement in the civilian standard of living.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons the Greek Government and our own observers were
                            convinced last spring that it would have been politically impossible to
                            increase the defense budget at the expense of the economic development
                            program. Since then the Greek Government has been weakened by Cabinet
                            changes, the Cyprus question and the municipal elections of November
                            1954, when communist-supported mayors were elected in five of the
                            country’s six leading towns. Our Embassy believes these election results
                            were largely caused by popular dissatisfaction with the Government’s
                            lack of significant progress in improving the standard of living. Thus
                            the stable and friendly <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName>
                            Government would risk almost certain political suicide if it attempted
                            to increase defense expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1956.</p>
                        <p>Another factor which cannot be ignored in deciding on our level of
                            economic aid for Greece in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 is the
                            adverse effect which the Cyprus question has had on Greek-American
                            relations. American prestige has declined in Greek eyes, and if we now
                            decide to cut Greek aid, the friendly and cooperative relations which we
                            have had with Greece may be expected to suffer.</p>
                        <p>Thus a cut in Greek aid of $10 million, which is a comparatively small
                            share of our over-all aid program, would probably lead to a substantial
                            reduction in Greek armed forces and might well reduce our influence in
                            this strategically placed country at a time when Greece can play an
                            important role in strengthening the Balkan alliance and the connections

                                the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East area had been somewhat
                                dimmed by the precipitate conclusion of the Turkish-Iraqi Pact<note

                                the ensuing heavy-handed Turkish approach to the Arab states,
                                particularly Syria and Egypt. His talks with Arab chiefs of mission
                                had convinced him that all the Arab states wished eventually to
                                cooperate with the West but that they felt they must be dealt with
                                as a unified group and not picked off individually with bilateral
                                agreements which would arouse suspicions among their sister states.
                                He believed that time should be given them to prepare for such
                                cooperation and that it would be very helpful if, during this
                                period, some limited defense assistance could be extended to them.
                                Within six months, during which Arab defense capabilities might be
                                built up to some extent and serious attempts made to implement
                                international agreements relative to Israel, it might be possible to
                                bring the Arab states into some defensive agreement with the West,
                                either through the extension of the North Atlantic Treaty or perhaps
                                by means of a more limited Mediterranean pact. (<hi rend="italic"

                                    States in current Middle East developments. He had originally
                                    enunciated the Northern Tier concept in 1953, when his tour of
                                    the Middle East convinced him that countries on the border of
                                    the Soviet Union who had long been subject to Russian pressures
                                    would be more inclined to work out some arrangement of defensive
                                    strength based on anti-communism than states to the south, which
                                    were preoccupied with other problems. It would also be more
                                    feasible for the United States to extend defense assistance to
                                    an anti-communist grouping of northern states. The Secretary
                                    indicated that developments were now taking a somewhat different
                                    course from the one he had first envisaged. He had not
                                    anticipated such an early adherence by the United Kingdom. As to
                                    other states of the area, we are not exerting any pressure to
                                    accelerate their joining the pact; on the other hand, of course,
                                    we would not try to prevent their adhering if they wished to do
                                    so in <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0564"/>their own
                                    interests. However, it might be well if further developments
                                    should come more slowly. The adherence of one or two states
                                    bordering on Israel would raise difficult questions. For
                                    example, the furnishing of military assistance to them would in
                                    turn lead Israel to feel that it must be strengthened
                                    militarily. The result might be a small arms race in the

                                    well known that Churchill was determined not to preside over the
                                    liquidation of the British Empire, and during the time that he
                                    was in the saddle all British decisions in that direction, such
                                    as those relating to the Sudan and the Suez Canal, were taken
                                    with the utmost reluctance. British policy on many questions may
                                    be modified or reexamined under a new Prime Minister. Of course,

                            freeze its position and deny it maneuverability. He wondered whether the
                            story in last Sunday’s <hi rend="italic">New York Times,</hi> reporting
                                <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> as saying that the
                            Cyprus case “would be submitted <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> to the
                            United Nations,” implied the intention of the Greek Government to bring
                            this matter to the Security Council. The Ambassador protested that there
                            was no plan to seek Security Council action on Cyprus, but his
                            Government would be forced to present it again at the next General
                            Assembly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWO1">Baxter</persName> said he knew
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1">Cannon</persName> had been
                            advising Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName>
                            not to commit the Greek Government irrevocably to any specific course of
                            action. Official Greek statements that Greece “would pursue the Cyprus
                            question by all appropriate means” should certainly be sufficiently
                            forthright to meet political necessities in Greece. Such a flexible
                            position would permit the Greek Government to take advantage of any
                            changed circumstances which may develop during the next few months.</p>

                        <p>The Greek Foreign Minister came to see the Secretary at the former’s
                            request and took up the following subjects:</p>
                        <p>1) He said that he was worried over the apparent fact that Austria was to
                            be neutralized. The Secretary clarified this by saying that, whereas
                            Austria intended to declare its neutrality, there was no question of it
                            being neutralized in the sense of being deprived of the means of
                            self-defense. In fact, the Soviets had agreed to the deletion in the
                            treaty of the articles which imposed a ceiling on the size of Austrian
                            post-treaty army and armaments.</p>
                        <p>2) He then turned to the main subject of his meeting with the Secretary,
                            additional US aid to compensate for the effects of the recent
                                earthquake.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">Between April 19 and May 14,
                                a series of earthquakes hit the port city of Volos in northern
                                Greece. Documentation on US interest in providing assistance and
                                relief is <hi rend="italic">ibid,</hi> Central File 881.00.</note>
                            The Foreign Minister discussed the damage and the courageous effort
                            which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> had
                            already taken to help the sufferers. He emphasized over and over again
                            that it is not possible for the Greek Government to take care of this
                            situation alone. The budget will be exhausted. Without help there will
                            be much less chance of maintaining in Greece stable internal conditions
                            and carry on with the success of the Greek construction projects such as
                            the oil refinery, hydroelectric plant, and better communications, all of
                            which have given Greece much courage. In order to conserve what has been
                            done the Prime Minister of Greece is obliged to ask for US aid. This has
                            already been taken up with the US Embassy at Athens. The Prime Minister
                            has sent his personal greetings to the Secretary and asked the Foreign
                            Minister to explain the very difficult position of his government. If
                            some additional aid is not forthcoming, it may be necessary to reduce
                            the military expenditures. The Foreign Minister pointed out that any
                            weakening <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0566"/>of the Greek army
                            would have unfortunate repercussions on the morale of the people, which
                            in turn would hurt the army because the people are its supporters. Mr.
                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> then mentioned the return of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> party on the left.
                            The Greeks regard the future with a certain anxiety lest elections go
                            badly. While the people are actually anti-Communist, they are
                            nevertheless watching the future closely. The Foreign Minister said he
                            did not wish to give the impression that the Greek people would bargain
                            with its liberty and friendship from one side to the other. He merely
                            wished to point out that the situation could be exploited by people who
                            wished to weaken or abolish the army. Greece as a free country is a
                            bastion and must have a stable government holding the confidence of the
                            people. Accordingly, the Foreign Minister appealed to the Secretary to
                            study the request which had been already submitted officially to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he had not seen this request but that he would
                            certainly study it with much sympathy.</p>
                        <p>As for US aid to Greece, the Greeks have talked to Clair Francis who was
                            quite encouraging about the possibility of using agricultural surpluses.
                            The Greeks also talked to General <persName corresp="#p_GGAM1"
                                >Gruenther</persName> and wished the Secretary and General to
                            discuss this situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">In a June 15
                                memorandum to <persName>Francis</persName>, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SWK1">Scott</persName> noted that discussions had
                                begun in Athens to provide Greece with $15 million in addition to
                                the $16.5 million already programmed for fiscal year 1956. Half of
                                the additional aid was to be provided through Mutual Security funds
                                and half through the sale of agricultural commodities. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 881.00/5–2455)</note></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Exintaris</persName> emphasized that the provision of aid
                            should be handled in such a way to have the maximum psychological and
                            moral effect. It should be done all at once and the announcement of aid
                            should be done in one package for psychological effects because the
                            Greeks are very impressionable.</p>
                        <p>3) Finally, the Foreign Minister raised the question of Cyprus. He
                            thought the British Liberal Party had adopted a reasonable position and
                            hoped that the United States could use its influence with the British.
                            The Foreign Minister and the Secretary noted that while the Liberal
                            Party might represent a large section of British opinion, it had no
                            votes. The Secretary said the US had not intervened directly with the
                            United Kingdom on this matter. Exintaris stated that the recent
                            conversation between <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> had gone very badly
                            which had made <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName>, a
                            military personality, very irritated with the British. The Greek
                            Government would hope that the United States could help to arrive at a
                            solution. The Secretary said it would be better to wait until after the
                            British elections.</p>

                        <p>As we seem to be entering period during which we may begin to reap some
                            positive fruits from our policy of strength, it would seem prudent to
                            bear in mind need to avoid weakening existing position and to give
                            appropriate recognition to those who have made a significant
                            contribution thereto. Greece is symbol United States post-war decision
                            stand firm against Soviet Communist expansionism and has been a
                            practical bulwark in that endeavor since 1947. I can imagine no better
                            time than at present to call attention to this fact than by Presidential
                            invitation to <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Marshal Papagos</persName> to
                            visit United States to discuss matters of mutual concern between our two

                            your schedule and that of President may make mid-September earliest

                            has been received will serve constructive purposes outlined this

                            Among the subjects raised were naval assistance to Greece (memorandum of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secreatary</hi>: The question of the
                            privileges and immunities of United States military personnel in Greece
                            has become <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0569"/>an acute political
                            problem in Athens. The issue is increasingly embarrassing to a
                            government friendly to the United States, and threatens the excellent
                            relations between the United States and one of its staunchest allies.
                            The State Department, therefore, strongly suggests that we should agree
                            to negotiate promptly on the problem with the Greek Government.</p>
                        <p>Present arrangements are based on the United States-Greek <gloss
                                target="#t_AMAG1">AMAG</gloss> agreement of 1947 <note n="2"

                            was negotiated at a time when Greece’s existence as a free nation was
                            threatened by the Guerrilla War. Under this and subsequent arrangements
                            our military personnel enjoy virtual “extra-territoriality” and are
                            completely immune from both civil and criminal jurisdiction in the Greek
                            courts. Such immunity far exceeds that granted to the United States by
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. As Greece has
                            recovered her strength and pride, popular resentment against the
                            extraordinary immunities granted to alien military personnel stationed
                            in Greece has increased.</p>
                        <p>For over a year our Embassy in Athens was successful in dissuading the
                            Greek Government from raising the question formally. However, the Greek
                            Government is losing its ability to withstand popular criticism on this
                            question. During the past six months, Foreign Minister
                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> has repeatedly raised the
                            question with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1">Cannon</persName>
                            in the course of official conversations. Finally, on June 14, the Greek
                            Parliamentary Opposition demanded a statement from Foreign Minister
                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> on the status of the question.
                            In reply, the Foreign Minister made it clear that his Government
                            considered it necessary to revise the present arrangements and was
                            already in contact with our representatives.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the Greek Government has not only officially raised the question
                            with us, but has publicly gone on record with its position that a
                            revision must be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1">Cannon</persName> feels that the
                            longer we wait on this question the more difficult our bargaining
                            position will become. At present the Greek Government is considered
                            willing to negotiate an agreement by which United States military
                            personnel would receive privileges and immunities at least as favorable
                            as those we enjoy in other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>It is essential, of course, that friendly and harmonious relations be
                            maintained with allied countries where our forces are stationed. Greece
                            in particular has been one of our most loyal friends. If you agree that
                            it is in the interests of the United States Government to negotiate
                            promptly with the Greek Government on this subject it <pb n="540"
                                xml:id="pg_540" facs="0570"/>would be appreciated if your Department
                            would advise us of its views on the question.<note n="3"

                        <p>Greece has been without effective political direction since Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> became seriously
                            ill nearly six months ago. The two Vice Premiers, the Minister of War
                                <persName corresp="#p_CP1">Canelopoulos</persName> and of Foreign
                            Affairs <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName>, have been competing, though
                            … for the leadership of the Greek Rally, the conservative coalition now
                            in power. The Ministerial Council—the body which expresses collective
                            governmental authority—apparently has had no real meetings for the past
                            three or four months, although actions are being taken in its name. Its
                            members are resentful of one another. Each of the Ministers acts
                            independently of any central direction. Other factions within the
                            Government are also jockeying for a position of power.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, a secret military group appears to be influencing part
                            of the government from behind the scenes, and has come to dominate some
                            branches of the administration. This para-governmental group, known as
                            Sacred Bond of Greek Officers (<gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss>),
                            is <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0571"/>now in control of the Army,
                            Air, and probably the Navy, guards the ailing Prime Minister, influences
                            the Cabinet, and seeks to guide the Palace. The opposition parties are
                            publicly committed to disbanding <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss>
                            if or when they come to power.</p>
                        <p>Indications are that the Palace is uncertain how to evaluate the
                            political outlook in Greece and is undecided on what to do if <persName
                                corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> withdraws or dies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName>’s departure is likely to take
                            place before new elections are due in November 1956. Yet, while the
                            political leadership of the party in power has lost its vitality, the
                            political opposition of the center—the Liberal Party under <persName
                                corresp="#p_PG1">Papandreou</persName> and the Liberal Democratic
                            Union under <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName>—appears at
                            present unable to capture the initiative.</p>
                        <p>The current relaxed international atmosphere in Greece has given the left
                            wing parties an impetus, and provided the stimulus for an upsurge in

                            but I am stimulated by your letter of September 2<note n="2"

                            till this time been able to get around to it.</p>
                        <p>In response to the specific point raised in your letter, that is, the
                            plans of <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>, the Embassy …
                            has been following this subject very closely both with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> himself as well as with
                            persons in the Royal circles sympathetic to the aspirations of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>. <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542"
                                facs="0572"/>Just before his departure on leave the Ambassador had a
                            long talk with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>, the
                            purport of which was reflected in the intelligence reports you
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>I agree with you that ideally it would be a tidier situation all around
                            if <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> would continue to
                            serve in a transitional government should such a government have to be
                            set up. However, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            himself feels very strongly that staying on would adversely affect the
                            possibility of his becoming prime minister and we have to take his
                            judgment seriously in arriving at our own conclusions as to the better
                            course. If he sullies himself politically by serving in what may likely
                            be the unpopular swan song period of the Rally as we know it, his
                            qualities of leadership and professional competence may be lost for an
                            indefinite period. A lot will depend of course on the actual march of
                            events and the extent to which a crisis situation might develop in
                            Greece in the weeks ahead as a result of various internal and external
                            pressures now at work.</p>
                        <p>If we are lucky, the question you raise may not be acute until later in
                            the year. Just before the King’s departure for Yugoslavia there was a
                            momentary flurry in Royal and political circles, the gist of which
                            seemed to be the apparent decision of the King to persuade <persName
                                corresp="#p_PMA1">Papagos</persName> to resign and to appoint
                                <persName>Stephanopoulos</persName> as his successor in an interim
                            government. At the same time the Marshal, or at least his family,
                            embarked on a small counter-campaign. This involved an indirect approach
                            to me in which some persuasive arguments were used to make a strong case
                            for the Marshal to remain in the prime ministership as long as possible.
                            … There is a good deal to be said for this point of view, and certainly
                            in the present atmosphere the formation of a new government bringing
                            with it the possibility of early elections is a prospect I do not view
                            with enthusiasm. In the end the Marshal managed to get a good medical
                            certificate from a French doctor and the King and Queen went off to
                            Yugoslavia with the stated purpose of not coming back to Athens until
                            the end of October. Some critics in high places have told me that the
                            King and Queen were acting like spoiled children in insisting on
                            carrying out their plans for a long vacation in Austria, but the King’s
                            absence might actually have a beneficial effect in that it will tend to
                            reduce to a minimum speculation about imminent political changes.</p>
                        <p>All this of course took place before the recent blow up in Greco-Turkish
                            relations and the rather sad conclusion of the London <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0573"/>Conference from the Greek point of
                                view.<note n="4" xml:id="d284fn4">On August 29, a tripartite
                                conference of representatives of the United Kingdom, Greece, and
                                Turkey convened in London to discuss problems of the Eastern
                                Mediterranean. The conference was suspended on September 7 pending
                                Greek and Turkish consideration of British proposals for granting
                                self-government to Cyprus. On September 6, a series of violent
                                anti-Greek riots broke out in Istanbul and Izmir resulting in
                                extensive damage and destruction of Greek-owned shops and Orthodox
                                churches. The rioting was reportedly in response to a number of
                                anti-Turkish incidents in Salonika on September 5.</note> Other than
                            what we have said at some length in recent cables on this subject I
                            would only like to add here that these recent events make it absolutely
                            impossible to predict whether the present Government will stay put for a
                            few more months or whether the King will change his plans and come back
                            to Athens. Otherwise it would have been a pretty safe bet that no
                            important changes would occur here until November.</p>
                        <p>Not directly related to the foregoing but certainly worth consideration
                            in the present overall Greek picture is the attached memorandum of a
                            conversation I had with <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                            >Papandreou</persName>, the Liberal Party leader.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d284fn5">Not printed.</note> Although it covers a number of
                            topics, I should especially like to allude to his statements about the
                            fear of the Greeks that we are abandoning them, a fear which at this
                            time seems primarily to stem from the fact that there has not been from
                            the United States either officially or otherwise a public condemnation
                            of the atrocities in Turkey against the Greeks. The Greeks expect an
                            awful lot under the best circumstances but knowing so well our
                            traditional humanitarian reaction to persecution of minorities, they
                            simply cannot understand why we seem to take so lightly the recent
                            outbreaks against the Greek minority in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>I do hope we can get a favorable response to our recent suggestion on how
                            to handle the Presidential invitation to the Marshal. I hope that you
                            are pushing this wholeheartedly.</p>
                        <p>All of us here look forward to your paying us a visit before the end of
                            the year both because we would like to see you again and also because a
                            visit now or in the near future would be very useful.</p>

                                            initiation of U.S. aid to Yugoslavia. One basic
                                            condition for aid continuation is Yugoslav contribution
                                            to western defense, which means effective military
                                            cooperation with her western neighbors, Italy and
                                            Greece, To Greece this is of great importance because
                                            Yugoslav cooperation enables her to base her defense on
                                            the very strong strategically important struma position

                                    transmitted to the Department:</p>
                                <p>“During talk October 24 with Greek Foreign Minister, I assured
                                    him that we would take no precipitate action on any Turkish
                                    request for special economic aid. He apparently feared that we
                                    had under contemplation large scale aid in response to pleas he
                                    understood Turks had made to us. At present time favorable
                                    response by us would be interpreted, according to him, in
                                    Greece, as inordinate sympathy for Turks. He indicated, however,
                                    that if some additional aid to Turkey in future were tied to
                                    Turkish reimbursement Greek claims for September riots, would
                                    kill two birds with one stone. I assured him we would take no
                                    action without regard to Greek sensibilities and in referring to

                            preparatory to making similar request when he sees the Secretary. He did

                            he call on me, led off with summary of current political situation. Gist
                            his remarks was that, with elections scheduled next year (he was not
                            responsive to my query regarding date), government is faced with
                            prospect of going before electorate amongst whom neutralist sentiments
                            are growing with Communist encouragement, and who are increasingly
                            questioning need to maintain armed forces at present level which takes
                            30 percent of Greek budget. Added to this is public feeling that United
                            States has “let Greece down” and abandoned its democratic principles in
                            United Nations vote on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>To combat these tendencies present government, who are being called
                            “westerneers” by large segment of public, urgently need additional
                            economic aid from United States. There is an unfavorable balance of
                            payments situation, but <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName>
                            thought this manageable. The main need for assistance is in connection
                            with (a) budget <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0581"/>deficit of
                            about 10 percent and (b) economic development program. This necessary to
                            curb inflation, with its inevitable effects at the polls, and give
                            public hope for future improvement in standard of living. All this calls
                            for an increase, according to <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> figures, in United States economic aid from
                            present level of about $40 million to $61 million, including certain
                            amount of surplus agricultural commodities. Moreover swift action is
                            essential if desired political effects are to be achieved. Finally,
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> stated he was
                            specifically instructed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> to say that aid must be in form of grant not
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>In addition to economic aid, <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> made plea for <gloss target="#t_OSP1"
                                >OSP</gloss> contracts to permit ammunition factory to continue
                            operations, existing orders being near completion.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> I would report his
                            remarks to appropriate quarters but presumed he aware this organization
                            had no supervisory functions respecting country aid programs. Re <gloss
                                target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> explained difficulties facing this
                            program as ammunition build up nears completion and need arises to put
                            production facilities on standby basis.</p>
                        <p>In discussing political prospects, <persName corresp="#p_TS1"
                                >Theotokis</persName> referred to need for “normal international
                            relations”, as well as economic aid. In response my query what this
                            involved, he said resolution of Cyprus problem and difficulties with
                            Turkey. I ventured opinion former not likely be brought about prior to
                            election. He seemed to agree but responded gulf between British and
                            Greek positions “deep but not very wide”. So far as difficulties with
                            Turkey are concerned it was plain his main preoccupation was with 2
                            ceremonies in Izmir (see earlier telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">In

                            “moral rehabilitation” Greece would be complete. Re compensation
                                <persName corresp="#p_TS1">Theotokis</persName> was much less clear.

                            but he was vague as to other claims. Called Turkish offer $300,000 (his

                            strong views that prospective negotiations should include all American
                            personnel. We endeavored, I believe, with some success to dispel their

                                    facs="0584"/>seize power by force. The first attempt ended in
                                three months—the second continued until October 1949, when the
                                    <gloss target="#t_KKE1">KKE</gloss> declared a “change in its
                                political line” and “a tactic of withdrawal in the face of the
                                enemy’s colossal superiority.” Since the latter date the <gloss
                                    target="#t_KKE1">KKE</gloss> has steadily lost strength and
                                significance; it does not at present constitute an immediate
                                political or insurrectionist threat to Greek security. This defeat
                                was the result of resolute action by the Greek Government, supported
                                by American and British aid, and of the withdrawal of Yugoslav
                                support for the guerrillas. However, in spite of substantial
                                successes achieved by Greek security forces in uncovering and
                                breaking up clandestine <gloss target="#t_KKE1">KKE</gloss>
                                organizations during the past five years, the Party does continue to
                                present a considerable security threat in terms of its current
                                capability for subversive activity and its potential for sabotage
                                and guerrilla warfare.</item>

                                proportion of its membership consists of industrial workers,
                                peasants, and agricultural workers. Recruitment and indoctrination
                                is believed to be concentrated at present among Greeks abroad and an

                                Its recruitment of youth has been impeded by proscription of its

                                northern Greece. Rural strength is also largely concentrated in the
                                sensitive northern area adjoining the Bulgarian border, around
                                Salonika, Kavalla, and Drama.</item>

                            <item>As of January 1955 over 3,500 Greeks of an estimated 50,000–80,000
                                resident in the Soviet bloc had been repatriated. So far their
                                resettlement and rehabilitation has been largely unsuccessful. In
                                spite of joint American-Greek security screening, the group
                                presumably contains undetected trained agents, and the growing
                                dissatisfaction within the group makes it likely that many others
                                will be susceptible of recruitment by the <gloss target="#t_KKE1"
                                    >KKE</gloss> in the future. Funds are currently inadequate to
                                support the government program for handling these 3,500 repatriates
                                and other pressing matters such as the Volos earthquake disaster
                                have diverted attention from the development of a well thought-out
                                program for the refugee group as a whole. It is anticipated that the
                                security threat to the sensitive northern areas of Greece, where the
                                majority of the repatriates are now living will increase
                                significantly if a substantial proportion of the group still in the

                                undermine the faith of the Greek people in the Rally government, to
                                create economic and political instability, and to exacerbate

                            <item>The Greek Government would probably be willing to accept technical
                                assistance to improve its internal security forces, provided this
                                did not entail diverting aid from the armed forces. While the
                                Government recognizes the necessity for outside help in meeting
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments and in

                                economic development. Consequently any effort to divert aid from the

                                rather than to the economic program would be politically
                                unacceptable.</item>

                                Greek armed forces, while small, would play an essential role in a
                                general war. A reduction of military and economic aid would diminish
                                Greece’s ability to meet its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                commitments and would seriously affect allied military strategy in

                            lines which follow.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that we should seek to retain the maximum measure of
                            United States jurisdiction in criminal cases involving members of the
                            United States forces in Greece which is concomitant with our over-all
                            interests. It is also agreed that the provision regarding the status of
                            our forces under the present Military Facilities Agreement with Greece
                            is causing serious difficulties to the friendly Greek Government and
                            should be renegotiated. The basic remaining question to be determined is
                            the maximum amount of criminal jurisdiction that can be retained. What
                            is this maximum? Present agreements between the United States and Greece
                            can be abrogated by Greece. The question of “extraterritoriality” for
                            United States forces has become a major cause of difficulty in our
                            relations with Greece at a time when these relations have already been
                            strained over the Cyprus question. <note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">On

                                in Athens on October 13, 1953. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            a sore point with people of every political hue. The present friendly

                            effect a “caretaker” government which has announced elections for the
                            early spring. It is anxious to subdue the anti-American emotions in
                            Greece, and to begin rebuilding Greek-Turkish relations. It deserves our
                            full support. In negotiating changes in our Base Agreement, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> government must
                            accomplish tangible results or seriously jeopardize its popular support.
                            On November 9 the Embassy reported that the Greek Government had made it
                            clear that it desired to start negotiations very soon (Embassy telegram

                            has also indicated that if prompt agreement on a revision were not
                            reached, he might have to make a public declaration and perhaps
                            introduce a bill into the Greek Parliament.</p>
                        <p>In order to determine, then, what is the maximum measure of criminal
                            jurisdiction that may be retained, it is our conviction that our Embassy
                            at Athens should be instructed to carry on its negotiations on the
                            following basis. First, the Embassy would seek agreement along the lines
                            you propose: the elimination of all reference to “extraterritorial”
                            rights, the application of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Status
                            of Forces Agreement arrangements for matters arising under civil
                            jurisdiction (i.e. return of civil jurisdiction to Greece) and the
                            retention of United States jurisdiction in criminal cases which under
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula <pb n="559"
                                xml:id="pg_559" facs="0589"/>would fall under Greek jurisdiction. It
                            would be further agreed that if the Greek authorities so requested, and
                            if the United States authorities agreed, a criminal case could be tried
                            in a Greek court. Our Embassy in Athens would be instructed to seek
                            agreement on this basis through firm and vigorous negotiation.</p>
                        <p>However, if after every proper effort had been made, agreement with the
                            Greek Government could not be reached, the Embassy would then seek
                            permission to start the second phase of the negotiations. In this phase
                            the Embassy would offer to put criminal jurisdiction on the same general
                            basis as our agreements with other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries, i.e. Greece would retain primary criminal jurisdiction, but
                            would waive such jurisdiction except in cases of particular
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this method of negotiation would be the best and most
                            practical way of determining the maximum amount of jurisdiction which
                            the United States can retain in criminal cases.</p>
                        <p>The proposed instruction which has been prepared in the Department of
                            State does not place members of the United States Military Assistance
                            Advisory Group in Greece on the same status as members of the Embassy
                            staff. This is chiefly due to the relatively large size of the Advisory
                            Group as compared to the Embassy. As of October 1, 1955 there were a
                            total of 174 Americans on the Embassy staff compared to 261 officers and
                            enlisted men on the staff of the Advisory Group, of whom 154 were
                            enlisted men. There would be no objection to placing all the members of
                            the Advisory Group on the same status as the Embassy when the number of
                            officers and enlisted men has been considerably reduced. This is
                            provided for in the proposed instruction. This is done in other
                            countries where the Advisory Groups are relatively small. For the
                            present the principal officers of the Advisory Group should be given
                            diplomatic status, and the remaining personnel should be on the same
                            status as other military personnel in Greece.</p>
                        <p>We are anxious to remove this source of irritation between the United
                            States and Greece, on which our Embassy has urged renegotiation for over
                            sixteen months, as rapidly as possible. We therefore hope that agreement
                            can promptly be reached between appropriate officers of the Department
                            of Defense and the Department of State to send instructions based on the
                            method outlined above. We also believe that the two Departments must
                            reach an understanding in advance of sending out the instructions to the
                            effect that if agreement with the Greek Government can not be reached,
                            the two Departments will promptly authorize Embassy Athens to proceed
                            with the second set of proposals. I believe that an effort to maintain
                            the first position as the only basis for negotiation might well cause
                            the Greek Government to insist on strict adherence to the Status of <pb

                        <p>I recommend that the two Departments should promptly reach agreement on
                            the basis outlined above.</p>

                        <p>The Greek Ambassador said he was alarmed by the unity which the
                            opposition parties and groups were showing and feared that they might be
                            able to defeat Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName>. He implied that this unity was the result of
                            high feelings in Greece over the Cyprus question and that these feelings
                            in turn were caused by the way in which that question had been handled.
                            He said he felt strongly that something positive must be accomplished on
                            the Cyprus question before the elections if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName>’ victory was to be assured.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that we had
                            already pushed the British government and that he was confident that at

                            According to these minutes, Archbishop Makarios was willing to accept
                            the phrase in the formula referring to “strategic considerations”, but
                            not the phrase “treaty obligations”. Archbishop Makarios had repeatedly
                            asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> if the

                            were not primarily strategic. <persName corresp="#p_HFMSJ1"
                                >Harding</persName> had almost conceded that they were. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had then suggested that the
                            phrase “strategic considerations” would cover the whole thing.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> said the phrase
                            “treaty obligations” was fundamentally unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> suggested that if
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HFMSJ1">Harding</persName> were able to agree that the
                            two phrases really meant the same thing and one was acceptable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he should then be
                            able to agree to the other. The Turkish interest was also
                            reemphasized.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> then pleaded that
                            something be done before the elections as he was very fearful of the
                            outcome.</p>

                                exert some influence on Turkey favorable to a Cyprus

                                    the Greek Government’s case for economic aid in 1956 and 1957.
                                    The Prime Minister noted that in addition to a $60 million aid
                                    level for ordinary foreign exchange and budgetary deficits,
                                    Greece was in need of special assistance of $68 million for the

                                harassment and failures his government had experienced in foreign
                                affairs. He felt that if his government is to survive he must
                                achieve some progress quickly during the next few months and before
                                Cyprus is raised at the General Assembly. Since the government’s
                                principal support comes from the agricultural classes, he is
                                especially anxious to make progress in a financial aid program for
                                agriculture. The tobacco workers and other workers of Northern
                                Greece are complaining about the government’s failure to accept the

                            <item>The next three or four years will probably see an increase in
                                internal controversy and political maneuvering, in which leftist and
                                neutralist elements will almost certainly gain strength. A return to
                                a pattern of unstable multiparty coalition governments would provide
                                the strengthened left with further opportunities for developing
                                influence and popular support, particularly if new strains developed
                                with the Western powers or economic conditions deteriorated.
                                Nevertheless, it is unlikely that a Communist or Communist-oriented
                                government will come to power in Greece during this period. (Paras.

                            <item>Given a continuation of US aid at approximately present levels and
                                sustained demand for Greece’s major export products, the Greek
                                economy will probably remain relatively stable over the next few
                                years. Its average annual rate of growth even with the continuation
                                of present US aid will probably not exceed three percent, an <pb

                                to be little likelihood that any Greek government will be able to
                                carry out a program of economic development large enough to cause
                                significant improvements in employment or in Greek living conditions
                                during the period of this estimate. (Paras. 38–40)</item>

                                conciliation, some expansion of Greece’s economic dealings and other
                                relations with the Bloc will take place, though not to the extent of
                                making Greece economically dependent on the Bloc or of compromising
                                Greece’s <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> status. (Paras. 42,

                                Present US military influence may decline as a result of the Cyprus
                                and Turkish issues, although such loss would be counterbalanced to a
                                large extent by Greece’s military interest in <gloss

                                for military assistance. If fears of Communist aggression continue
                                to recede, military expenditures are likely to be reduced somewhat
                                within the next few years. (Paras. 40, 48–49)</item>

                            <item>Greece will probably retain its basic pro-US and pro-Western
                                orientation, at least for the period of this estimate. Nevertheless,
                                the absence of a Cyprus settlement will impose serious strains on
                                the relations between Greece and its allies, particularly the UK and
                                Turkey. Moreover, even if an understanding on the Cyprus issue is
                                achieved, Greece will probably pursue a more independent policy
                                toward the US and UK. (Paras. 57–58, 63)</item>

                            <item>We believe that there is about an even chance that some formula
                                for the solution of the Cyprus problem will be agreed upon within
                                the next year or two. Achievement of a Cyprus settlement, however,
                                will at best be a difficult and delicate process which could easily
                                be set back by insufficient flexibility on the part of the
                                principals concerned or new flareups of popular feeling. (Paras.

                            estimated at $20 million. It will produce about 70,000 tons of nitrogen

                            nitric acid and other chemicals to Greek industries. It is anticipated

                            pressure on this question. It is Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CCW1"
                                >Cannon</persName>’s considered view that if agreement is reached
                            soon, we can count on Greek good will in the interpretation of the
                            agreement, but that each week’s delay means an abatement of that good
                            will since the Government is under heavy pressure from public opinion
                            which will continue to move steadily against us so long as the question
                            remains unsettled.</p>
                        <p>The question has now been an open source of US-Greek friction for two and
                            a half years and it has been under negotiation for seven months. It is
                            our judgment that the Department should now take the position that for
                            the good of US-Greek relations it should not be allowed to drag on any
                            longer. In reaching this conclusion it is recognized, as was pointed out
                            at some length in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 303 (Tab A),
                            that amendment of the existing agreement along the lines desired by the

                            reach a waiver agreement based on the Netherlands formula. Our Embassy
                            in Athens points out (Tab B) that the Greek Government could hardly be
                            expected to be persuaded by our problem in Germany to take political
                            risks of its own in trying to sell an unpopular agreement to the Greek
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations have reached the point where over-insistence on exact
                            wording may cause serious Greek resentment and cause the Greek
                            Government to interpret any agreement so narrowly as to be contrary to
                            our interests.</p>

                            matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We should like to propose that we seek firm and prompt agreement with

                                <item>Finally, if neither of these proposals is acceptable, the

                                    In present circumstances it is believed that the Greek
                                    Government would be willing to interpret this agreement in a way
                                    which would be at least as favorable to our interests as would
                                    be the case if it were possible to reach agreement on the
                                    proposals now under consideration. These proposals constitute

                            (I was, for instance, seriously asked by a Government minister whether
                            my statement that “the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can not impose”
                            a Cyprus solution, meant that the US had decided to oppose
                            inscription).</p>
                        <p>Disappointing British reaction to current Greek position indicates that
                            far from assuming any early improvement in Cyprus situation, we must
                            rather anticipate a worsening unless British can be persuaded at least
                            to go slow on unilateral moves.</p>
                        <p>It is inevitable that above developments are and will continue to be
                            great shock to Greeks, genuinely shake their faith in US and encourage
                            neutralist trend which already alarms many competent political observers
                            here, and have other unpredictable but certainly not favorable political
                            repercussions. I therefore believe it of utmost importance, now that we
                            are giving the Greeks a major dose of realistic disillusionment, to make
                            such gestures as we can to demonstrate our sympathetic interest.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister’s theme was that within the overall problem of common
                            defense, Greece’s importance was not adequately recognized. Its
                            importance was based on two facts: first, that Greeks are good fighters,
                            who faced total destruction in 1940 in preference to abandoning their
                            allies, and, second, the country’s geographical position. Greece’s long
                            northern frontier reaching to Turkey was as vulnerable to invasion from
                            Bulgaria, the Prime Minister claimed, as <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574"
                                facs="0604"/>it was when Greece joined <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. If war occurred, the connection with Turkey could be
                            severed, the Straits bypassed and Greece forced to fight deep within its
                            own territory.</p>
                        <p>Greece needs a division of tanks and sufficient antitank equipment to
                            correct this situation, the Prime Minister emphasized.</p>
                        <p>In reply to questions from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName>, the Prime Minister stated 1) that Greece was
                            poor in antitank weapons and had only obsolete light tanks; 2) that
                            there had been some joint Greek-Turkish planning within the Balkan Pact
                            (The Prime Minister played this down.); 3) that the Greek request was
                            based on the findings of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As to the Greek Navy, the Prime Minister said that the Greeks, with their
                            naval tradition, felt they were unprotected from the sea since they knew
                            their Navy had only a few obsolete units. <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1"
                                >SHAPE</gloss> found that modernization was needed.</p>
                        <p>If the above requests (tanks, antitank equipment and naval units) are
                            fully met, the added cost of “training, maintenance and material” for
                            such additional equipment would cost, the Prime Minister estimated, $13
                            million per year. The present Greek military budget cannot be increased.
                            Greece now spends more than it can afford. If new equipment arrives,
                            Greece will need additional military aid for “training, maintenance and
                            material.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> acknowledged the heavy
                            burden of the Greek defense effort, said that the United States had made
                            a substantial contribution to this effort and that, subject to the views
                            of Congress, it would appear to be in the American interest to continue
                            this contribution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName> indicated that
                            subject to Congressional approval and certain other factors, the
                            defensive strength of Greece might well be considerably augmented. Some
                            recoilless rifles had been provided in past programs. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> had made us aware of
                            the Greek desires. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName> added, there were no plans for additional financial
                            aid of the type requested.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister opened by sketching the recent improvements in the
                            Greek economy and indicating the remarkable stability which Greece had
                            achieved: stable cost index, stable currency, greatly increased bank
                            deposits reflecting public confidence and a reduction of interest rates
                            from as high as 30% to 16%, greater availability of capital, balanced
                            budget (“really balanced”), and good prospects for investment. “The
                            economy of the country is now good and the Government seeks to
                            consolidate these gains on a more permanent basis.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister spoke first of Greece’s current needs and then of long
                            range needs.</p>
                        <p>As to current needs he said that the US had usually taken into account
                            the Greek balance of payments deficit which for the current Greek fiscal
                            year (ending December 31, 1956) was $73 million. Greece could absorb $62
                            million in surplus commodities and the remaining $11 million should be
                            in global PA’s. The Prime Minister also requested the release of 400
                            million drachmae before the end of the current Greek fiscal year (before
                            December 31, 1956). He also emphasized that Greek crops were poorer than
                            had been expected five months ago when it was thought Greece would
                            receive $60 million in aid. He hoped any additional amount would not be
                            in surplus commodities. It was important for the Greek Government to
                            have the American decision soon since a new Greek budget had to be
                            prepared for January 1, 1957.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the long range program Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC1">Karamanlis</persName> said that although the Greek
                            economy was now stable, it could be easily upset. The chief need was to
                            improve the agricultural economy, since 63% of the population were
                            farmers who were the backbone of Greece. Most of them were very poor
                            since the arable land was only 20% (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) of the
                            area of Greece. The Government’s long range agricultural improvement
                            program had two main parts: 1) improved farm production (agricultural
                            machinery, etc) and 2) improved food processing (canning, etc). This
                            Greek program would cost $60 million including a fertilizer plant. In
                            making plans for it the Greek Government needed assurances that
                            counterpart would be released promptly as the need arose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> promised that these
                            questions would be studied immediately and sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then presented the attached paper on Economic
                                Aid.<note n="2" xml:id="d302fn2">The November 15 memorandum, not
                                printed, dealt with the following subjects: the level of aid for the
                                current fiscal year, the need for the restoration of the
                                earthquake-damaged areas in the Aegean Islands, extra aid for
                                agricultural expansion and development—$60 million—duration 4 years,
                                and terms and conditions under which aid is accorded to
                                Greece.</note></p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary then made some extremely cordial closing remarks to
                            the Prime Minister stressing his admiration for Greek courage in time of
                            war and for Greek determination and success in the subsequent
                            reconstruction. He also emphasized the importance of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, the potentialities of the Balkan
                            Pact, and closed by underlining the usefulness of these talks.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was pleased and replied with warm appreciation.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 12:50.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stressed that our
                            attitude towards <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was unchanged and
                            that recent events, especially in Hungary,<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2"
                                >Reference is to the Hungarian rebellion during the fall of

                        <p>The Prime Minister agreed on the need for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, but said that it had been shaken by recent events. He
                            emphasized the need for strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and suggested three general needs for improvement: 1)
                            The need to widen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s duties to
                            include political and economic questions, so that the members would come
                            to have the solidarity of a family with common peacetime interests as
                            well as the need of common defense in time of danger. 2) Cyprus is a
                            weakness. “We are in one alliance, but we don’t have the ability or
                            perhaps the courage to tackle this question between three members.”

                            Anglo-French action in Egypt<note n="4" xml:id="d303fn4">Reference is to
                                the Anglo-French air bombardment of Egyptian installations in the

                            disapproved of these actions. If some procedure can’t be found for
                            settling these disagreements, the US should take the lead and attempt to
                            “discipline” some of the members by “persuasion”. The US is in a good
                            position to do this since its prestige was never higher.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed that something
                            needed to be done, but indicated the difficulties especially if the
                            United States appeared to try and force other members. He hoped that the

                            that the members were democracies which did not take lightly to
                            dictation. He suggested that formal debates in the North Atlantic
                            Council would not be apt to settle differences and suggested that the
                            United States could be more useful by informally offering its good
                            offices.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he was not attempting to make specific
                            suggestions but commented that any democracy which joined an alliance
                            must surrender some of its sovereignty. Democracy must not be allowed to
                            drift into license.</p>

                                <item>The Department of Defense advises that the Greek military
                                    establishment is short of certain supplies, particularly <gloss

                                    global PA’s to Greece for some $10 million, it is possible that
                                    we could use the occasion of such issuance to obtain
                                    satisfactory assurances from the Greek Government that it would

                                <item>It is quite clear that Greece will need, before the end of
                                    this fiscal year, surplus agricultural commodities even in
                                    excess of the $10 million in question. If we issue global PA’s
                                    for $10 million as you suggest, the question will then arise as
                                    to the financing of needed surplus agricultural commodities. We

                                            for which they are asking global PA’s;</item>

                                        <item>Provide them under Title I, PL 480. This in turn
                                            raises two questions, first, whether this may be done
                                            legitimately in view of the normal marketing requirement
                                            of PL 480, and, secondly, the very limited authority
                                            remaining under the existing legislation. While the
                                            amount of existing commitments against PL 480, Title I,
                                            is not clear, it appears that authority remains for less
                                            than $100 million of commodities at <gloss
                                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> costs, which are the
                                            governing values. The latest request from Greece,
                                            together with the wheat imports that otherwise would be
                                            financed from Section 402, would require about $45
                                            million of this remaining authority (about $26 million
                                            at market prices). Since there are a number of other
                                            urgent requirements for Title I programs, for example,
                                            Korea, Turkey, Pakistan, The Philippines, Peru, Burma,
                                            and Indonesia, which greatly exceed the amount of the
                                            remaining authority, I do not believe that <gloss

                                            of such large proportion of the remaining authority for
                                            Greece.</item>

                                            because of the number of high priority competing demands
                                            for our reserve funds.</item>

                            request as soon as possible, it seems to be clear that we cannot at the
                            moment take the action which you hoped could be taken, i.e. to make
                            available to Greece $10 million in non-agricultural PA’s, unless you
                            consider the matter of such high political significance as to require an
                            increase in the Greek Defense Support <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580"

                        <p>In spite of the short notice (the Greek Government was notified on April
                            26 that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>
                            intended to be in Greece on April 28 on his way to Bonn), arrangements
                            were made and the Mission was well received by the Greek Government. The
                            Mission consulted with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1"
                                >Karamanlis</persName> and other Government officials. It was
                            evident that the Prime Minister’s prime concern was in obtaining greater
                            recognition of the role he considered Greece could play in the Middle
                            East and in getting United States moral and economic support for this
                            role. The Prime Minister stated that he thought the United States
                            underestimated Greek potentialities in this respect, and having invested
                            large amounts of money and much effort to make Greece strong, the United
                            States had failed to utilize <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0612"
                            />the results of this investment. He indicated particularly that
                            Greece’s long history of trade with the Middle East, the numerous Greek
                            colonies in Arab states, the influence of the Greek Orthodox Church, the
                            association of Greek and Middle East military in a spirit of confidence,
                            the lack of Arab fear of Greece because of the latter’s lack of
                            imperialist ambitions, and the fact that Greece could serve as a show
                            window of the results of American friendship and aid were all factors
                            which emphasized the potential of Greece in playing an important role in
                            the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government further was quite critical of United States policy
                            in its emphasis on Turkish influence and in promoting the Baghdad Pact.
                            They insisted the Pact is a bad influence and expressed the hope that
                            the American Doctrine<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">In a statement on
                                January 5 before a joint session of Congress, President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> requested legislative
                                authority to authorize military and economic assistance to countries
                                in the Middle Eastern area that requested aid. The measures that the
                                President proposed also included the employment of the armed forces
                                of the United States “to secure and protect the territorial
                                integrity and political independence of such nations, requesting
                                such aid, against overt armed aggression from any nation controlled
                                by International Communism.” The President’s message, introduced
                                into the House of Representatives on January 5 as H.J. Res. 117 and
                                into the Senate on January 9 as S.J. Res. 19, was approved by
                                Congress and signed by the President on March 9. The Middle East
                                resolution became popularly known as the American Doctrine or

                        <p>The Government heartily endorsed the American Doctrine and, as indicated
                            below, was quite willing to emphasize the importance of United States

                            contemplated in connection with his Mission and the Greek Government
                            made no request for such assistance. Therefore, no commitments were

                            experience with American aid and cooperation, demonstrates the

                        <p>Since the previous <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy statement
                            on Greece, substantial progress has been made toward achieving the
                            objectives then stated (Cyprus Was not then a problem affecting US-Greek
                            relations). Greece has become a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and the Balkan Pact. It has achieved, since 1952,
                            unusual political stability by Greek standards. Communism is no longer
                            an imminent threat to political stability. Greek-American relations are
                            on a firm and friendly basis and our important base rights in Greece are
                            secure. Greece has given clear public endorsement to the American
                            Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Although Greece is still a poor country, its economy has made a
                            remarkable recovery since 1947, when it was near collapse. This has
                            resulted from substantial US aid and Greece’s own efforts. The Greek
                            military posture has also been improved. Due largely to US aid, approved
                            force goals have been met in terms of organization. However, there is a
                            serious shortage of technical skills and much equipment is obsolete.
                            Further progress is dependent on continued American aid. The cost of
                            Greece’s share in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s defense is
                            beyond its present ability to pay.</p>
                        <p>Cyprus has become, since 1954, the dominant issue in Greek foreign
                            policy, affecting nearly all aspects of our relations with Greece. It
                            has contributed to a rigidity in Greek foreign policy and <pb n="584"
                                xml:id="pg_584" facs="0614"/>caused serious strains with its major
                            allies. The continuation of the present political stability in Greece is
                            in large part dependent on progress toward a peaceful settlement of this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>American aid programs in Greece have been greatly reduced since 1952. The
                            draft statement notes, however, that if Greece is to continue the
                            necessary evolution in its long term economic and military strength,
                            future United States assistance at about present levels will be needed.
                            The statement, therefore, recommends that we continue to lend reasonable
                            international political support to Greece and also: <list>

                        <p>These recommendations are made on the understanding that we make clear
                            that Greece itself must make greater efforts to correct the deficiencies
                            in its armed forces. It is also proposed that the United States review
                            the possibility of achieving a reduction in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>-approved force levels for Greece.</p>
                        <p>The statement also recommends that we provide economic assistance
                            sufficient to aid Greece in maintaining the necessary military posture
                            and in continuing a modest rate of economic growth. Any large reduction
                            in our economic aid would almost surely cause any Greek Government to
                            reduce its defense budget in order to maintain the politically important
                            economic development program.</p>
                        <p>Cost estimates of these recommended programs are given in the economic
                            and financial annexes to the paper.</p>
                        <p>The statement includes a detailed supplementary statement of “US Policy
                            Toward Settlement of the Cyprus Dispute.” It recommends that we continue
                            to encourage those primarily concerned to work out a peaceful solution
                            among themselves and that we preserve our maneuverability by not at
                            present favoring any specific formula. It notes, however, that if
                            necessary to bring about an acceptable solution, on terms which
                            strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests in the area,
                            we should be prepared to participate in arrangements guaranteeing the
                            interim or eventual status of Cyprus. You will note that some Planning
                            Board members took exception to this. They question whether the United
                            States should now state that it is prepared to enter into such a
                            guarantee arrangement. We believe it is important <pb n="585"
                                xml:id="pg_585" facs="0615"/>that the way should be open for such
                            participation by this country should it become necessary for a lasting
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Since this <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Statement was drafted, the
                            UK has informed us that they propose inviting Greece and Turkey to a
                            conference in London in early September to seek a solution to the
                            international aspects of the Cyprus problem. They hope that we and M.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> will attend as
                            observers. We believe that this British plan is generally consistent
                            with the policy guidance stated in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Statement. The degree to which we should associate
                            ourselves with the plan, however, and whether we attend is still under
                            consideration within the Department.</p>

                            <head>STATEMENT OF US POLICY ON GREECE</head>
                            <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Importance of Greece to the United
                                    States</hi></p>
                            <p>1. Greece is important to the United States because of its strategic
                                location, its proximity both to the Soviet Bloc and to the Near
                                East, its membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and
                                its ties to Yugoslavia through the Balkan Pact. Together with its
                                Balkan Pact neighbors, Turkey and Yugoslavia, Greece forms a land
                                barrier to Soviet access to the Mediterranean. Also Greece has given
                                the United States and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                extensive base rights. Communications facilities and a <gloss
                                    target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> support group are maintained in
                                Greece and are important links in our global network of bases.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">International Political
                                    Orientation</hi></p>
                            <p>2. Greek foreign policy is based on close ties with the United States
                                and opposition to Soviet Communism. This has been shown by armed
                                resistance against Communism (1947–49), active participation in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (Greek troops fought in
                                Korea), and adherence to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                (1951) and the Balkan Pact (1954). This Western orientation is based
                                on its classic tradition and historical, personal and commercial
                                bonds with the West.</p>
                            <p>3. As Greek economic strength and political stability have grown,
                                national self-confidence has increased and Greece has taken a more
                                independent and nationalist role. Greek nationalism has frequently
                                sought, often successfully, to bring within Greece’s frontiers,
                                areas inhabited primarily by ethnic Greeks. This irredentism, behind
                                which the Greek Orthodox Church has generally been the main driving
                                force, has found its principal expression recently on the Cyprus
                                problem and has led to serious inter-allied tensions. These <pb
                                    n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0617"/>nationalist ambitions are
                                tempered by a deep fear of Russia and distrust of Bulgaria, and a
                                strong awareness that the United States is the only power which will
                                protect Greece and not take advantage of it.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Greek Relations with the United
                                    States</hi></p>
                            <p>4. While most Greeks know that in a real crisis their country must
                                depend on the United States, their country’s economic recovery has
                                permitted a sharp reduction in American aid and caused an increased
                                sense of Greek independence. These developments have been healthy
                                for Greek-American relations. Greece has been especially anxious to
                                reduce the appearance of dependence on the United States. Thus on
                                September 7, 1956, US-Greek status of forces agreements were revised
                                on a basis more acceptable to Greek sensibilities.</p>
                            <p>5. Nevertheless, American prestige in Greece is far greater than that
                                of any other foreign power. The Greeks look to the United States for
                                leadership in world affairs and for political support, notably on
                                the Cyprus question. Recent events in the Middle East, especially
                                Soviet threats at the time of the Suez war, have emphasized the
                                importance to Greece of its ties with the United States. While
                                Greece gives general support to American efforts to resolve Middle
                                Eastern problems and has given clear public endorsement to the
                                American Doctrine, its attitude toward Middle East questions is
                                influenced by its suspicions of Turkey and its fear of Turkey’s
                                entrenching itself as the chosen instrument of US policy in the
                                area. In addition, the presence of the influential Greek community
                                in Egypt makes Greece unwilling to oppose Egypt directly.</p>

                                    Statement of US Policy Toward Settlement of the Cyprus Dispute,
                                    distributed separately on a limited basis. [Footnote in the
                                    source text. This statement is printed as an Enclosure to <ref
                                        target="#d256">Document 256</ref>.]</note></p>
                            <p>6. Since 1954 the Greek Government has given active diplomatic
                                support to the movement on Cyprus of Greek-speaking Cypriots
                                demanding union of the Island with Greece (enosis). Some 80% of the
                                Cypriots consider themselves to be of Greek ethnic origin. The Greek
                                Government supports their claim that the principle of
                                self-determination should be applicable to Cyprus. The Cypriot
                                problem has become the dominant issue in Greek politics and foreign
                                policy. It has absorbed the energies of the Greek Government,
                                diverted attention from the problems of economic development, and
                                caused the rigidity of Greece’s foreign policy and serious strains
                                with its major allies. The Cyprus question, by sharpening Greek-Turk
                                distrust, <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0618"/>has been a large
                                factor in preventing the development of the Balkan Pact among
                                Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia. At present Greece regards the
                                Alliance as potentially important for both military and economic
                                reasons, but claims that it cannot be developed until the Turkish
                                attitude on Cyprus changes. Meanwhile Greek-Yugoslav relations have
                                continued reasonably close, principally in the military sphere.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Internal Strengths and
                                    Weaknesses</hi></p>
                            <p>7. By Greek standards there has been unusual political stability
                                under fairly strong conservative governments since 1952. The Greek
                                Communist Party is illegal and its underground group is under
                                effective surveillance. Communism is not now an imminent threat to
                                political stability. On the other hand, the Cyprus question and a
                                Soviet friendship campaign in Greece have assisted Communist efforts
                                to legitimize the Party and have contributed to some “neutralist”
                                tendencies in Greek public opinion and politics. The extremely
                                difficult Cyprus problem poses the most immediate threat to Greek
                                political stability. Progress towards a solution acceptable to the
                                Greek Government and the Greek Orthodox Churches of Cyprus and
                                Greece, would facilitate a continuation of rule by the conservative
                                and moderate groups. Greek frustration over Cyprus and differences
                                between the Greek Government and the Greek Orthodox Church over the
                                issue, might lead to a series of less stable governments still drawn
                                primarily from conservative and moderate groups but subject to a
                                varying degree of leftist influence.</p>
                            <p>8. The internal security forces are reasonably capable of handling
                                Communist subversion inside Greece. The USSR has issued a severe
                                warning against the stationing of nuclear-capable forces in Greece
                                which the Greek Government has rebuffed. The USSR has also started a
                                strong cultural offensive aimed at Greece. In handling Soviet
                                overtures Greece is concerned by the strength and proximity of the
                                Soviets. Also there is some feeling in the Greek Government that
                                Soviet support on the Cyprus question should not be lost. Finally, a
                                potential security problem is the presence in the Soviet Bloc of
                                about 50,000 Greeks who left home or were abducted during the
                                guerrilla war. Many have probably been indoctrinated and Soviet
                                pressure for the return of all these Greeks would pose problems. So
                                far only about 3,500 have been allowed to return and they have
                                caused no serious difficulties.</p>

                            <p>9. Greece is poor and has limited natural resources. Half the people
                                live on the land but only a quarter of the land is fit for <pb
                                    n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0619"/>farming. Industry is small
                                and inefficient and largely depends on imported oil for power.
                                Economic development has been retarded by repeated periods of
                                warfare. Greek defense expenditures are heavy in relation to Greek
                                resources. There is over-population in terms of the present level of
                                development with resulting unemployment and underemployment.</p>
                            <p>10. However, the Greek economy has made a very substantial recovery
                                since 1947 when Greece was on the verge of economic collapse. Living
                                standards are now higher than prewar; crop and industrial production
                                have increased 60% since 1940, while the population has increased
                                10%. The gross national product increased at an average of roughly
                                6% annually from 1951 through 1956, and per capita income about 4%.
                                Currently the rate of increase in <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                    >GNP</gloss> appears to be approximately 4%. Greece has recently
                                followed sound economic policies and has a relatively stable
                                economy, although it has been running budgetary deficits, partly as
                                a result of investment expenditures. In recent years, US aid,
                                including <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480, has enabled
                                Greece both to finance a balance of payments deficit and to increase
                                its foreign exchange reserves. Exports and earnings from services
                                and remittances have more than doubled since devaluation in
                                1953.</p>
                            <p>11. Greek recovery since 1947 was made possible by a combination of
                                substantial US aid and Greece’s own efforts. From June 1947 through
                                June 1957 expenditures for all forms of US economic aid totalled
                                approximately $1,491 million (average <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                    >FY</gloss> 1948–1951, $261 million; average <gloss
                                    target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952–1957, $74 million). It is
                                estimated that US economic aid expenditures for defense support and
                                technical assistance (the only forms of economic aid capable of
                                current estimate) should be less in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                    >FY</gloss> 1958 than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.
                                Even with recent economic growth at a rate which compares favorably
                                with other Western European countries, per capita income is about
                                $240, the lowest in Free Europe except Portugal. A continuing rate
                                of economic growth is needed for the continuance of pro-Western
                                Greek governments. External economic aid will be necessary to
                                maintain such a rate of economic growth so long as the United States
                                encourages Greece to continue defense expenditures at present
                                levels. Reduction or elimination of such aid would probably compel a
                                corresponding reduction in Greece’s defense effort.</p>
                            <p>12. Greece is a member of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> and
                                has taken an interest in <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>’s
                                work in less developed areas. It has unofficially discussed with the

                                program. Greece realizes the importance of associating itself with
                                the European Free Trade Area but as a relatively underdeveloped
                                country sees basic difficulties in doing so.</p>

                            <p>13. Greece has committed its ground and air forces to <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Its naval forces, under national
                                command, will be assigned <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                missions in time of war. Greece’s primary <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> mission is to provide maximum forward defense
                                against Soviet attack from the north. Greek forces would also assist
                                in defending the Straits area and would maintain internal security.
                                The present strength of the Greek armed forces is: Ground Forces
                                106,000; Air Force 15,150; Navy 15,500.</p>
                            <p>14. Department of Defense approved force objectives for Greece are 11
                                and 13/3 infantry divisions, 1 armored brigade, 12 air squadrons and
                                54 combatant vessels. These force objectives have been met in terms
                                of organization, but technical skills are seriously lacking and much
                                equipment is obsolete. In the case of ground forces, current active
                                forces provide only one-third of wartime strength and there is no
                                effective training program for the reserves necessary to meet
                                wartime strength requirements. The Greeks are good fighters. Greek
                                forces are capable of maintaining internal security. They could
                                provide limited defense against a satellite attack, but even if
                                fully mobilized could provide only a relatively brief delaying
                                action against a joint Soviet-satellite attack. Military planning
                                against any Communist attack is, of course, within a <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context.</p>
                            <p>15. The cost of Greece’s share in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>’s defense is beyond Greece’s present ability to
                                pay. Greece is devoting to defense about 5% to 6% of its <gloss
                                    target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The level of Greek defense
                                expenditures has not risen as rapidly as <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                    >GNP</gloss>. Defense expenditures are about 28% of all
                                budgetary expenditures (excluding those financed by US aid). The
                                United States has financed, on the average, 20% of the Greek defense
                                budget in the last three fiscal years. The US Military Aid Program
                                provides virtually all of the dollar costs for military maintenance,
                                replacement and modernization of the Greek armed forces. There is
                                little likelihood that Greece will assume in the immediate future a
                                relatively greater defense burden than she is now carrying.</p>
                            <p>16. US military aid programmed for Greece from 1947 through June 1957
                                approximated $1,150 million, of which an estimated $970 million was
                                delivered by June 30, 1957. Compared with the military assistance
                                program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 of $51 million
                                and deliveries of $60 million, the military assistance program for
                                    <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 is currently estimated at
                                $110 million and deliveries at $120 million.</p>
                            <p>17. Although the Greek Government has requested additional equipment
                                which it believes vital to its defense, the United States has not
                                yet made a commitment as to any specific future military aid
                                program. Some consideration has been given to the deployment <pb

                                    Greece. As you know, the entire program of our aid under the
                                    Mutual Security Program for Greece and the rest of the Free
                                    World is still being considered by Congress. Until the necessary

                                    commitments on this subject. I must point out, however, that the
                                    total of our aid programs for the coming fiscal year may very
                                    well be reduced from last year. This will raise problems with
                                    respect to individual programs in many countries. I am sure that
                                    you understand that our aid to Greece will therefore have to be

                                >MSP</gloss>/8–2357)</note> In view of a discernible change in the
                            climate of Greek Government, press and public opinion in recent months,
                            stemming largely from a growing resentment over western and,
                            particularly, US failure to support the Greek position on Cyprus and
                            from the almost unanimous feeling here that US and western policy is
                            inimical to Greece’s real or fancied position, prestige and economic
                            interests in the Middle East, I am impelled to urge caution in
                            estimating Greek capacity and willingness to assume a greatly increased
                            proportion of her defense expenditures. I am especially concerned at the
                            possibility that Greece might be forced for financial reasons to reduce
                            her military effectiveness at a time when other nations in this area
                            friendly to the US are building up. In such an eventuality, Greece would
                            certainly feel the loss of its prestige to be great. We would be held
                            largely responsible and the opposition would be give a ready-made
                            opportunity to point out once again that <gloss target="#t_GOG1"
                                >GOG</gloss> foreign policies are ineffective. I wish to stress that
                            the minimum practical level of US support funds which any Greek
                            Government can live with has at least as much of a psychological and
                            political basis as an economic one. My staff and I have repeatedly
                            warned <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that US economic and defense
                            support assistance will be smaller this fiscal year and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is cognizant of <pb n="595"
                                xml:id="pg_595" facs="0625"/>lower illustrative defense support
                            figure $15 million and illustrative PL 480 figure $27.5 million. Recent
                            conversations with Minister Coordination and Minister Commerce indicate
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> also believes unlikely will
                            receive immediate and large credits under development loan fund, and
                            thus anticipates time will be required even partially to substitute
                            latter for present public investment program.</p>
                        <p>During each of last two Greek fiscal years, total US releases of local
                            currency, for budget and extra-budgetary projects, were equivalent of
                            $48 million. If $15 million defense support used for global PA’s and if
                            PL 480 finances Greek agricultural needs (estimated range $20–30
                            million), then 1958 Greek budget would realize maximum $28 million
                            drachmae equivalent, after taking into account amounts withheld for US
                            use and private enterprise financing. Failure provide defense support,
                            or even decision to program under section 402, <note n="3"
                                xml:id="d310fn3">Section 402 of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of

                                see 68 Stat. 833.</note> would result in even further sharp
                            reduction budgetary aid. Significant deterioration in Greek balance of
                            payments this year further supports case for global PA’s to finance
                            non-agricultural imports which recently 18 percent above 1956 level.</p>
                        <p>I urge most emphatically that we prod TA $15 million of defense support
                            in global procurement authorizations and finance Greece’s agricultural
                            commodity requirements under PL 480, having in mind that <gloss

                            figures of this order of magnitude. Because of this knowledge, I believe
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will be forced recognize that
                            such a program represents demonstrably our maximum effort in so far as
                            providing local currency to the Greek budget is concerned, even though
                            the result is a 30 percent cut in US budget support from present
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>Any further cuts, such as would flow inevitably from an absence of
                            defense support allocations to Greece or requirement to use defense
                            support money for agricultural commodity imports, would so magnify
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> problem of choosing between
                            reduced military expenditures, reduced public investment, or reduced
                            private consumption as to eliminate almost any possibility of finding a
                            solution which would be politically and psychologically acceptable and
                            economically sound.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and the Greek people
                            will find it difficult enough to understand and accept a 30 percent cut
                            in US budget support, and almost any Greek Government would find it
                            almost impossible to explain publicly “aid” reductions of a greater
                            magnitude. I believe it is critically important that we take all the
                            above factors into consideration in developing a 1957-58 budget support
                            program which, together with our military end item and military <pb

                            minimize tendency to attribute ulterior political motivations to almost
                            any economic policy.</p>

                            remarked that because of the attitude of Britain and some of the
                            Scandinavian countries, the market had not developed as Greece had hoped

                        <p>(3) Mr. <persName>Kassimatis</persName> then expressed the Greek
                            Government’s disappointment over the reduction of US aid to Greece. He
                            handed the Under Secretary an Aide-Mémoire on this subject, <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d311fn2">Not found attached.</note> underlining the
                            importance of United States aid for maintaining the level of Greece’s
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary expressed his appreciation of the Greek problem and
                            assured Mr. <persName>Kassimatis</persName> that his Aide-Mémoire would
                            be carefully studied. He reminded the Greek Minister of our own <pb

                        <p>In leaving, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGV1">Melas</persName> asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WMW1">Williams</persName> to bring to the
                            Under Secretary’s attention a point which he and Mr.
                                <persName>Kassimatis</persName> had been unable to make due to lack
                            of time. This had to do with the advantages accruing to the United
                            States from such visits as the Greek visit to Cairo. He had been told by
                            officers of the Department that it had been useful to have the full
                            accounts of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>’s attitude
                            which had been submitted following the visit. Mr. <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had treated the Greek
                            Prime Minister and Foreign Minister themselves as representatives of a

                        </list>
                        <p>In recent weeks and months the Embassy has reported to the Department a
                            series of increasingly frequent instances wherein Greece and the United
                            States have found themselves, primarily in the political and
                            psychological spheres, at odds on major and minor matters of policy. For
                            several weeks officers of the Embassy have studied these instances in
                            their contexts and believe that they are of sufficient importance to
                            constitute a trend which, … for lack of a better label, may be described
                            as a “disengagement” on the part of Greece from the essentially
                            “American” policy which she has followed since the end of the Second
                            World War.</p>
                        <p>This recently accelerated disengagement has become manifest in three
                            fields: (1) in Greek domestic politics and the Greek national
                            psychology; (2) in matters affecting the Middle East; and (3) in
                            Greece’s attitude toward Communists, Communism and the Communist Bloc of
                            states.</p>
                        <p>It should be said at the outset that this despatch is considered to be
                            chiefly an analysis of a trend which the Embassy considers to be of
                            major importance to United States and Western interests in this <pb
                                n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>part of the world; it is not
                            intended to be a balanced report of the entire picture of Greece and her
                            domestic and foreign policies of the moment. Furthermore, in order to
                            identify for the Department in the clearest and briefest manner possible
                            the factors which constitute this now recognizable trend, no attempt has
                            been made to provide bulky documentation to substantiate the thesis.
                            However, few items will be mentioned in this despatch which are not
                            already to be found in the Department’s files among previous telegrams
                            and reports submitted to Washington by the Embassy and by other United
                            States agencies operating in Greece. Here it is our purpose to tie
                            together all the factors of this trend primarily to identify and assess
                            them, so that having once been recognized they may be dealt with by the
                            Embassy and the Department.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Summary and Conclusions</hi></p>
                        <p>Greece today remains formally and officially tied to the United States
                            and her <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies and will continue
                            to be so tied for the foreseeable future. The United States is—and for
                            some time to come will probably remain—the paramount foreign power in
                            this country, as it has for the past ten years. But we are passing
                            through a period when our influence and prestige among the Greek people
                            and with the Greek Government are undergoing a reassessment and
                            readjustment in a changed world situation. We can no longer be as
                            certain as we have been in the past that we shall have Greece’s support
                            in foreign policy matters that are critical to us. In the Middle East
                            our policies and our actions in the past few years, with very few
                            exceptions, have been the contrary of what Greece has considered to be
                            her own best interests. In the Cyprus issue most of all we have failed
                            in Greek eyes to support the Greek position, and to the Greeks there is
                            no more important problem in this decade. Toward the Soviet Union and
                            the Eastern Bloc Greece’s attitude has undergone an accelerated process
                            of softening in the past year and a half and she less frequently asks
                            for or accepts our advice in her dealings with the Bloc. She feels that
                            we have ignored what she considers to be her special position in the
                            Middle East and that we have supported more strongly her ancient enemy,
                            Turkey, instead. The other reasons for this drift toward divergence and
                            disengagement are manifold; some are of a minor and transitory nature,
                            but others are deep, permanent, even normal and natural, and will be
                            difficult to correct. Unless they are corrected, however, there is a
                            distinct possibility that Greece will find herself ultimately in the
                            neutral bloc or in a “non-bloc” alignment where, we have reason to fear,
                            a growing number of Greeks today already feel themselves
                            psychologically.</p>

                        <p>By the nature of its subject this despatch has had to paint a rather dark
                            picture of the current state of Greek-American relations. While it
                            treats admittedly of only one side of the whole story it is a side
                            which, until recent weeks, had been of very small significance and which
                            was not an important factor in our relations with Greece. The trend
                            toward disengagement—or, as Liberal Leader <persName corresp="#p_PG1"
                                >George Papandreou</persName> has phrased it, “psychological
                            dis-association”—of Greece from American policy has recently become a
                            fact, recognized and deplored by the Embassy as well as by responsible
                            figures in public life in Greece. We are certain from remarks made by
                            the Prime Minister to the Ambassador that no one deplores this drift
                            more than <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Constantine Karamanlis</persName>,
                            himself, who assures us that regardless of the prominence of the present
                            trend Greece will remain loyal to her <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> commitments. Similar sentiments have been expressed to
                            us privately by other high Government personages and by members of the
                            Opposition as well. Unfortunately the latter will undoubtedly proceed as
                            usual in the current session of Parliament to berate the Government
                            publicly for being “American lackeys”. Politics in Greece is like that.
                            The unfortunate thing about this whole matter is that no one in public
                            life, with the exception of the King, has expressed any strong feelings
                            of late that Greece must resist a drift away from her <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ties and toward a softening attitude
                            on Communism.</p>
                        <p>On the economic side, the Embassy feels that there do not exist the same
                            grounds for concern as on the political. Greece’s volume of trade is 90
                            percent with the Free World and cannot be easily or abruptly changed.
                            The economic ministers of the present Government are realistically aware
                            of Greece’s continuing dependence on the West as a market for her
                            exports and as a source for the investment capital which she needs. Also
                            realistically (and privately) they are willing to face up to a gradual
                            tapering off of American economic aid, knowing that less aid is in
                            itself a measure of Greece’s growing economic prosperity, as its
                            capacity to absorb US surpluses decreases. Their sense of duty to their
                            country will, however, require them to protest loudly at any mention of
                            decreased assistance.</p>

                        <p>The Operations Plan is primarily concerned with the manner in which we
                            should seek to achieve our continuing important objectives with respect
                            to Greece in the face of strengthened Greek self-confidence growing out
                            of increased economic strength and political <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601"
                                facs="0631"/>stability on the one hand and reductions in our aid
                            programs in Greece on the other. We seek, as noted in paragraph 8, to
                            channel this increased self-confidence into greater support by the Greek
                            Government and people for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                            Greece’s Western alliances. Paragraph 9 points out that the Cyprus
                            question is the greatest obstacle at the present time to achievement of
                            this goal. This paragraph also notes how Cyprus has endangered virtually
                            all policies requiring Greek-Turk, Greek-US and Greek-<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> cooperation. Without specific
                            reference to Cyprus (because of the Presidential action noted above), we
                            therefore stress in paragraph 24 the importance of strengthening the
                            conviction of the Greek leaders and public that Greek interests lie with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the West.</p>
                        <p>Another of our policy objectives which has been thwarted by the Cyprus
                            dispute is the development of the Balkan Pact among Greece, Turkey and
                            Yugoslavia. The Board Assistants, noting developments since <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action on the policy paper, including
                            continued Greek-Turk differences over Cyprus and renewed uncertainty as
                            to the future of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, expressed reservations as to
                            the desirability of emphasis on its further development at this time.
                            Caution in US initiative is therefore suggested in paragraphs 8 and
                            26.</p>
                        <p>Considerable discussion took place in meetings of the working group and
                            the Board Assistants on the implications for US aid programs in Greece
                            of objective Number 7: “A Greek economy which can support reasonable
                            economic development and assume a larger share of the cost of the Greek
                            defense established [<hi rend="italic">establishment</hi>].” The basic
                            policy paper for Greece pointed out the political importance in Greece
                            of continued economic growth deriving from economic development projects
                            and stated that external economic aid would be necessary to achieve this
                            so long as we encourage Greece to continue defense expenditures at their
                            present increasing levels. We believe that the language of the policy
                            guidance in paragraphs 13 and 14 is a good general statement of this
                            problem and the outlook for our aid programs in Greece. Paragraph 13
                            points out that economic assistance in its several forms should be
                            continued to help Greece maintain an appropriate defense position as
                            well as a modest rate of economic growth. Paragraph 14 notes the
                            political problems in Greece growing out of heavy defense expenditures
                            but expresses our consistent policy that Greece should be encouraged to
                            assume a larger share of its total defense costs as its gross national
                            product increases. The possibility that the continuing review of Greek
                            force levels may provide a way out of this political dilemma is also
                            discussed. Paragraphs 38 and 40 state specific courses of action on this
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>On December 4, at the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> luncheon
                            meeting, the subject of the Operations Plan for Greece was raised.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WMW1">Murat Williams</persName> and L. Bruce
                            Laingen were present for the discussion. According to the preliminary
                            notes of the meeting, the following exchange occurred: <quote

                                    discussion by saying that he had never seen a country and people
                                    so completely centered on any one problem as is Greece and the
                                    Greeks on the Cyprus issue.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName>, <gloss
                                        target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, agreed and said that the
                                    Cyprus problem colors Greek attitudes towards everybody and
                                    everything. He reviewed the positions of England, Greece and
                                    Turkey toward the Cyprus question and said it now seemed
                                    impossible to avoid an acrimonious <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                        >UN</gloss> debate on the subject. He said that independence
                                    is a solution best characterized as mutually unsatisfactory to
                                    all concerned, but perhaps it will prove to be the only feasible
                                    one. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName>
                                    wondered whether the Cyprus question might cause Greece to pull
                                    out of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said this was unlikely
                                    since both the government and the opposition are violently
                                    anti-Communist. The government is resisting Communist support
                                    for the Greek position on Cyprus. He noted, however, that a
                                    continued inability to solve the problem would strengthen
                                    extremist groups which even now question whether Greece benefits
                                    from membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> because
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has not taken a
                                    position favorable to Greece on the Cyprus issue.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said
                                    that the cheapest and best way to provide dollars to Greece
                                    without expense to the Treasury would be to encourage tourism,
                                    especially in the undeveloped but extremely attractive islands.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> agreed, noting
                                    that significant hotel expansion is being carried out in Athens,
                                    and that the projected Balkan highway would be of great help
                                    also. It was agreed to add a paragraph to the Operations Plan
                                    indicating our interest in promoting tourism in Greece.</p>

                                    harmed Greek-Turk relations, frustrated virtually all policies
                                    requiring Greek-Turk cooperation, such as in the Balkan Pact,
                                    and has even impaired Greek support for its ties with <gloss

                                    should continue to emphasize the necessity that Greece assume

                                    long-term solutions should be sought, and that while the US is
                                    prepared to assist the parties concerned procedurally, it does
                                    not intend to assume direct responsibility for any particular
                                    solution. In any efforts to assist the parties, the US while

                                    countries, should not ignore the primarily local interests of

                                    relations as feasible with all responsible leaders. Efforts
                                    should be made through these contacts to counteract local

                                    looking to the US for world leadership, Greece considers that it
                                    is capable of playing a larger role in the Near East. Greece is
                                    jealous of the role envisaged by Turkey for itself in this area.
                                    The Greek desire to play a larger role in the Near East was in
                                    part responsible for the decision of the present government to
                                    give public support to the American Doctrine <pb n="605"

                                    However, it should be recognized that Greek sensitivities
                                    regarding the Arab states can be a restraint in the degree of
                                    open support which Greece can be expected to continue to give
                                    the American Doctrine. These sensitivities grow out of such
                                    factors as the Cyprus question, the Orthodox Church and Greek
                                    communities in such places as Alexandria. For example, the Greek
                                    colony in Egypt enables Egypt, if it wishes, to exert pressure
                                    on Greece. Greek views on an increased role in the area,
                                    therefore, should be entertained sympathetically, but caution
                                    should be observed in encouraging Greek initiative.</item>

                                    considered in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> annual
                                    review process. Nevertheless Greece should be encouraged to
                                    continue to increase its share of the total military budget
                                    gradually, looking toward a greater degree of military
                                    self-sufficiency, especially as the country’s gross national
                                    product grows. It must be recognized, however, that no Greek
                                    Government is likely to reduce significantly its economic
                                    development program in order to increase defense expenditures.
                                    Further, it should be noted that Greek opposition leaders have
                                    announced their intention to press for a reduction in Greek

                                    of the Greek armed forces somewhat in favor of a smaller and
                                    more efficient force. Whether or not these force levels are
                                    reduced, US efforts should be directed toward improving their
                                    effectiveness. It should be made clear in this connection that
                                    the US military assistance program is based on the assumption
                                    that the Greeks will try to correct their own military
                                    weaknesses and deficiencies. Critical comments on these points
                                    may be required from time to time, but US officials should miss
                                    no opportunity to commend Greek officials on progress towards
                                    improving the effectiveness of their armed forces.</item>

                                    The likelihood of the emergence of a similar coalition in the

                                    it occurs, would be likely to produce a further increase in

                                    respect to the level of US economic assistance was the security
                                    advantage which the United States obtained. He pointed out that
                                    US economic assistance to Turkey was the best possible way to
                                    buttress our security interests in the Near Eastern area.
                                    Moreover, it was much better and cheaper to assist the Turks to
                                    build up their own armed forces than to create additional US

                            their comments on the report on Turkey’s economic situation which was
                            prepared by Heuser, a Federal Reserve official on loan to <gloss

                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 882.00/1–355) The Heuser report has not been
                                found.</note> The report has confirmed our officials’ feeling that
                            the economic situation has deteriorated and will probably continue to
                            deteriorate in coming months.</p>
                        <p>In light of the report’s conclusions on the advantages of using
                            devaluation as a stabilization tool and of US objectives in Turkey, our
                            officials suggest three possible alternative approaches. The first is to
                            recognize Turkey’s determination to proceed with its development at the
                            highest rate possible and assist with such means as we have at our
                            disposal. This would probably require some increase in US aid and would
                            certainly require frank discussion and acceptance by the Turks of
                            economic policies designed to permit the best use of aid to the most
                            advantage. The second is to influence the Turks to adopt economic
                            policies more consistent with the presently scheduled aid. This would
                            imply reducing the rate of economic growth admittedly below the level
                            necessary adequately to support and maintain Turkey’s defense effort in
                            a period in which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force goals are
                            to be achieved.</p>
                        <p>The third alternative is to have a direct and frank expression of the
                            official US view that unless Turkey adopts and implements a policy of
                            greater internal stability and external solvency, the US has no choice
                            but to reexamine its support of Turkish efforts in military and economic
                            build-up. In considering this third alternative, the US would have to
                            keep in mind our commitments to Turkish defense build-up, our acceptance
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force goals, unilateral Turkish
                            commitments to the US, our encouragement of Turkey to assume <pb n="610"

                            and makes recommendations concerning: (1) the role Turkey is playing in

                            has accumulated over $150 million of arrears in payments due to foreign
                            suppliers. Turkey recognizes that it is in difficulties and has asked
                            the US for a $300 million loan. It is our opinion (see paragraph 22

                            certain other agencies, called for a determination by April 1, 1955, of
                            “how best to fulfill such a commitment”. The second alternative, on the
                            right-hand side of the page, proposed by Defense and other agencies,

                            that the United States had made a definite commitment to the Turkish
                            Government, even if that commitment were qualified in some respects. No
                            corresponding commitments had been made by Turkey in response to the US
                            commitment. Accordingly, it appeared to the State Department to be a
                            question of the US honoring what, at least in Turkish eyes, amounted to
                            a firm commitment. For that reason, said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, he supported the first
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>The President quickly stated that it was hard for him to believe that the
                            United States could have made a commitment to Turkey in such very
                            precise form without the President’s explicit agreement thereto
                            (implying that he had not given such explicit agreement). …</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> quoted certain sentences from the aide-mémoire
                            which cast light on the nature of the alleged US commitment. The
                            President replied that regardless of the aide-mémoire, one would have to
                            presuppose that in all these deals between the United States and allies
                            which it was assisting, consideration was given to how much assistance
                            an allied country could profitably absorb. It therefore seemed indicated
                            to him that a fresh look should be taken at the whole problem of
                            assistance to Turkey. If this revealed that the Turks could make
                            profitable use of more money, the President said he would be for giving
                            it to them; but he was afraid that the gift of further money might harm
                            rather than help an important ally.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            strongly shared the President’s feeling on the subject. Of course, we
                            wanted to be strong in the general area of Turkey, Moreover, we wanted
                            to do all we could to build up the strength of the Turkish armed forces.
                            But his own recent visit to Turkey, in November 1954, had shown him a
                            number of serious difficulties. When he had gone to Turkey the previous
                            November, neither he nor any of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been made
                            aware of the commitment which the United States had made <pb n="614"
                                xml:id="pg_614" facs="0644"/>to Turkey in June 1954. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then proceeded to
                            illustrate the serious lack in the Turkish armed forces of career
                            soldiers, sailors and airmen with sufficient technical skill to make
                            profitable use of many of the modern weapons for which the Turkish
                            Government was making requests on the United States. He added that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> authorities in Turkey and the
                            United States Ambassador to Ankara likewise shared his own feeling that
                            the Turks were trying to move ahead too rapidly in building up the
                            strength of and in modernizing their armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> asked General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> (who was representing
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> in the latter’s
                            absence) whether he could throw any light on the problem of the
                            commitment the United States had made to Turkey. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> replied that since he had
                            discussed this matter at length with Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> before his departure to the Far
                            East, he believed he could throw some light on the problem.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> proceeded to
                            describe the circumstances of the visit of the Turkish Prime Minister to

                            1954. While he admitted that Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> had been obliged to “cut some corners”, and had
                            not discussed the program of military assistance to Turkey with the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff, he had at least discussed the commitment with the
                            Secretary of Defense. General <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> concluded his statement by commenting that
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> felt that the
                            United States had made a firm commitment to the Turkish Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>The President found this perplexing, and repeated that on the occasion of
                            the Prime Minister’s personal call on him,<note n="8" xml:id="d319fn8"
                                >For <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s account of
                                this meeting on June 2, 1954, see <ref

                            he had talked in generalities, which was why he believed that our
                            commitment to the Turks was only a qualified commitment. …</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> commented that
                            it seemed a plain fact to him that we had “got ahead of ourselves”, and
                            even so, the Turks were looking for further assistance. It seemed to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> rather idle to
                            debate the technical question as to whether we had made a commitment to
                            the Turks, and if so, what kind. Turkey presented the United States with
                            a colossal financial and economic problem. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> again insisted that the United
                            States had “out-promised” itself.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that it was
                            his view that all of us favored steps to strengthen the position of
                            Turkey. If they would go ahead on their part to take these steps, we
                            should do what was necessary on our side.</p>
                        <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0645"/>
                        <p>The President asked with some impatience whether the time hadn’t come for
                            Britain and France to step in and help us with such problems as Turkey.
                            Both these countries were eager to export manufactured goods, and
                            desperately needed markets.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> expressed the
                            judgment that our current program for assistance to Turkey contained
                            about as much as the Turks could successfully absorb unless they were
                            radically to improve their own capabilities.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> expressed the
                            view that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5510 did not quite present
                            in a fair light the program for the modernization of the Turkish
                            military establishment. As estimated in this paper, the costs of such a
                            program seemed to him too high. Accordingly, he proposed that the
                            Council agree that the United States did have a commitment to Turkey,
                            and thereafter “work it out” on the basis of Turkey’s ability to absorb
                            this military assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President said he agreed in general with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName>’s suggestion, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> offered language to
                            revise paragraph 20 accordingly. As he was doing so, the President said
                            that when you got down to the bottom of it, what Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> was saying was that the
                            commitment should be of such a nature that its implementation would be
                            useful to both Turkey and the United States. Accordingly, he felt that
                            the problem should be urgently studied by a new high-level commission
                            which should promptly go to Turkey and carry out this mission on the
                            spot.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            there were already several survey teams in Turkey. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added the opinion that we could
                            readily spend our money in Turkey if we could only be sure that the
                            Turks were up to using the money effectively. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> took issue with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, and insisted that the
                            Turks were not only ahead of themselves in the military sphere, but in
                            the economic sphere as well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> offered certain
                            revisions to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>’s proposed
                            language for paragraph 20, which the Council agreed to accept.</p>
                        <p>The President then spoke briefly from his own knowledge of the background
                            of Turkish military development since 1952, when he himself had last
                            been in Turkey. He drew the conclusion that the Turks were not yet in
                                <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">shape</gloss> to take a large amount of
                            new US military equipment. Therefore, thought the President, it would be
                            better for them to use money for training and men to make effective use
                            of new equipment. If we presented this problem in the right way, the
                            President was confident that the Turks would agree to our solution.</p>
                        <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0646"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said all he
                            wanted to add was a sense of urgency. We have got to get together and
                            settle this matter with the Turks promptly. It has dragged on much too
                            long.</p>
                        <p>After the Council had agreed on language dealing with the military
                            problem in paragraph 20, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> invited the members of the Council to turn to
                            what he described as the “sad part” of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5510—namely, the problem presented by Turkey’s
                            financial and economic condition. This, he said, was set forth most
                            clearly in paragraph 11, <note n="9" xml:id="d319fn9">Paragraph 11 of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5510 was identical to
                                paragraph 11 approved in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5510/1
                                    (<ref target="#d320"><hi rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>).</note>
                            which he read to the Council.</p>
                        <p>The President interrupted to point out that this appeared to be a
                            situation in which we could be of real help by using our great
                            agricultural surpluses, such as wheat. The President was insistent that
                            this point be followed up. General <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> assured the President that the United States was
                            already sending in wheat in exchange for Turkish chrome. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> was backed up by
                            Dr. Elliott (sitting for Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                                >Flemming</persName>), who provided figures on the exchanges of
                            wheat and chrome.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then went on to read the
                            Courses of Action dealing with the problems of Turkey’s economy. He
                            pointed out that there was no difference of view in the paper on the
                            economic courses of action, with the exception of paragraph 21, reading
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>“As an exception pursuant to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5501,
                            para. 55–b, be prepared to purchase from Turkey strategic minerals for
                            long-term strategic stockpile in order to assist Turkey to meet its
                            minimum essential civilian and military requirements.”</p>
                        <p>The Treasury and Budget members of the Planning Board favored deletion of
                            this course of action. The Joint Chiefs, on the other hand, had
                            indicated that they favored retention of the paragraph as written.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, who had by now
                            joined the meeting, said that it was his understanding that the Treasury
                            Department was now ready to withdraw its objection to this proposed
                            course of action. He went on to describe briefly the US stockpile
                            position with respect to chrome ore, noting that there was plenty of
                            room in the stockpile for adding more chrome, and pointing out that if
                            the current price of $48 were raised to $55, marginal producers in
                            Turkey might be brought into operations again.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he failed to see why it was necessary for the
                            United States to keep raising the price it would pay to stockpile chrome
                            ore from Turkey. This problem, along with the others, should be put in
                            the hands of Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> as part of the <pb
                                n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0647"/>new survey and as part of a
                            package deal between the United States and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> again pointed out
                            that the Council should realize that our stockpile position on chrome
                            was not very good. The President replied that that might well be the
                            case, but that it offered no excuse for us to jump what we were willing
                            to pay for chrome from $48 to $55. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> agreed with the President, and said that if we
                            needed it so badly we could buy chrome elsewhere than in Turkey. If we
                            raised the price that we were willing to pay Turkey for her chrome, we
                            might unwittingly add to Turkey’s embarrassing inflationary
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                            agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            and pointed out that there was no use in the United States “bailing out”
                            the Turks each successive time that they got themselves into trouble.
                            What we needed to do was to go over to Turkey now and deal with the
                            whole situation.</p>
                        <p>While the President said that he agreed with this statement of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, the latter should
                            remember, or try to recall, the prevailing climate of opinion when we
                            had made our promises to assist the building up of Turkey’s economy and
                            military position. We were “scared to death” at that time and only too
                            glad to welcome Turkey as a military ally.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            understood this, but that we could not reorganize everything that was
                            wrong with Turkey in a minute. The thing to do was to try to cool the
                            Turks off. They were so steamed up in their hopes for economic
                            advancement and modern military strength. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> queried whether we wanted to do
                            too much toward “cooling the Turks off”. After all, there were
                            relatively few nations who, like the Turks, were really steamed up on
                            our side of the struggle against the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> assured the President
                            that the US stockpile proposal, as set forth in paragraph 21, could be
                            made part of a US package proposal to Turkey, as the President had
                            earlier suggested.</p>
                        <p>The Council indicated approval for the inclusion of paragraph 21,
                            although the Director of the Budget warned that US stockpile
                            transactions should be handled on the basis of the items of materials
                            that the United States needed, and not solely on the basis of countries
                            which the United States desired to assist by purchases for the US
                            stockpile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> suggested that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName>, as head of the Council
                            on Foreign Economic Policy, might wish to add some comments on the
                            economic aspects of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5510.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> said that he only wished
                            to say that it was impossible to overemphasize the seriousness of
                            Turkey’s internal and external financial and economic position. The
                            Germans had found <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0648"/>themselves
                            obliged to shut off all credit to Turkish buyers last August. Three
                            months later they had offered to reopen credits, and they were now
                            flooded with orders from Turkish businessmen. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> said it was also essential to
                            remember that in their agreements with us the Turks had made a
                            commitment to put their own financial house in order, and that thus far
                            they had notoriously failed to do so. If they do not carry out this
                            promise, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> warned,
                            additional US assistance would amount to pouring money down a hole. The
                            situation was very much like the situation in Japan, with which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJM1">Dodge</persName> had been faced earlier
                            in his career.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PBGRWJ1">Porter</persName> admitted that
                            the Turkish economy was in dire straits, but said perhaps it might be
                            considered a “ray of light and hope” that the Turks have asked the
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to send its people into Turkey
                            to make a study of Turkey’s economic problem. At least the Turks had got
                            around to admitting that they did have an economic and financial
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> was suggesting
                            language to revise paragraph 22 in the light of the previous discussion,
                            the President said that he hoped that Ambassador
                                <persName>Warren</persName> could be told to start work at once
                            toward a solution of these problems. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> suggested that one or two
                            high-level people, not merely to compose a survey team but who were of a
                            policy-making rank, should be sent to assist Ambassador
                                <persName>Warren</persName>. Expressing agreement with this view,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he would
                            like to find “another Joe Dodge” for Turkey.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the President and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> both warned the members of the
                            Council not to overlook the fact, in their criticism of Turkey’s
                            economic condition, that the Turks were among the few people who had
                            openly manifested the will to fight.</p>

                                        regard to paragraph 21, <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                            >Radford</persName> noted that the JCS recommended the

                            <p>1. Turkey is of particular political and strategic importance to the

                                        route from the USSR to the Suez. Turkey borders the Soviet

                            <p>2. Turkey is a target for Soviet ambitions. In 1945 the USSR
                                presented claims to two eastern provinces of Turkey (Kars and
                                Ardahan) and in 1946 proposed a new regime for the Straits to be
                                established only by Turkey and other Black Sea powers, with joint
                                defense of the waterways by Turkey and the USSR. Turkey consistently
                                and firmly rejected these claims. Although Soviet aggressive demands
                                have recently been toned down, there is no reason to suppose that
                                Soviet objectives have changed. However, a direct attack upon Turkey
                                by armed forces of the USSR, or its satellite Bulgaria, is unlikely
                                unless the USSR is prepared to risk general war.</p>
                            <p>3. Turkey is consistently endeavoring to broaden and strengthen its
                                ties with Western Europe and the United States, and has made great
                                progress. It has taken a firm stand in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> against Soviet acts of aggression and obstruction
                                and is participating in other international organizations (<gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Council of Europe, <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_EPU1"
                                    >EPU</gloss>) in cooperation with the US and Western European
                                countries. Turkey is extremely sensitive to its national security
                                problem and alert to the need for collective defense. In 1939
                                Turkey, the U.K., and France signed a Treaty of Mutual Assistance
                                    <note n="6" xml:id="d320fn6">The Treaty of Mutual Assistance was
                                    concluded on October 19, 1939, at Ankara and ratified on

                                recently reaffirmed by the U.K. and France. Turkey, with US support,
                                pushed its candidacy for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
                                Organization, which it entered on February 18, 1952.</p>
                            <p>4. On February 28, 1953, Turkey, Greece and Yugoslavia concluded a
                                Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, confirming the close economic
                                and diplomatic collaboration which had been developing between the
                                three countries and providing for contingent military planning.

                                considered aggression against all, and that in such an event the
                                Governments would take the measures they deemed necessary, including
                                the use of armed force, to counter aggression. Although Yugoslavia
                                is committed only in the event of an attack on Turkey or Greece, it
                                has committed itself to consult <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622"

                                another <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country. Despite the
                                lack of a formal link of Yugoslavia with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> system, for all practical
                                purposes a good defensive system for the Southeastern European area
                                is being added to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense
                                system. There has been some discussion of Italy’s eventual
                                participation in the Turkish-Greek-Yugoslav Alliance. The basis has
                                therefore been laid from which a continuous Western defense system
                                from Northern Europe to Asia Minor might ultimately develop.</p>
                            <p>5. On April 2, 1954, Turkey and Pakistan signed an agreement
                                providing for continuing consultation on mutual security problems.

                                substantially the same purposes as were envisaged in the still-born
                                Middle East Defense Organization sponsored by the UK, France, and
                                the US and strongly supported by Turkey.<note n="10"

                                even more importance as a link between formal collective security
                                arrangements of the Western world and the Middle East. Turkey has in
                                fact been playing a leading role in seeking Middle East defense
                                arrangements, particularly expansion of the agreement with Pakistan.
                                A recent step looking toward the development of a northern tier was
                                a statement by Turkey and Iraq on January 13 [<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>6. Turkey is undergoing one of the most successful social, political
                                and intellectual revolutions of modern times. Turkey desires to
                                become a fully modern state based on western cultural ideas and has
                                been developing democratic forms of government and institutions.
                                From an inefficient, tyrannical and theocratic state, it has reached
                                a point where, in some respects, it can well serve as an example of
                                peaceful evolution for other underdeveloped areas.</p>
                            <p>7. From <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1947 through <gloss

                                in military aid to Turkey; from April 1, 1948 through <gloss
                                    target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1954 the US expended $262 million in
                                economic and technical assistance to Turkey. With this aid Turkey
                                has undertaken major programs to modernize its military
                                establishment and to develop its economy. Expenditure estimates for
                                the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 aid program total about
                                $348 million ($258 million military aid; $90.3 million economic and
                                technical assistance).</p>

                            <p>8. Although the Turkish armed forces have made great progress,
                                present plans for building up Turkey’s armed forces in accordance
                                with US interests will require continued substantial US assistance
                                over a period of years. During <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>s
                                1950–54 the US allocated one billion dollars for expenditure in

                                Navy and Air Force. In June 1954 the Prime Minister of Turkey
                                submitted a proposal to the Director of <gloss target="#t_FOA1"
                                    >FOA</gloss> for the partial conversion of the Turkish Army by

                                desired by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planners and the
                                Joint Military Mission for Aid to Turkey. The cost of this partial
                                conversion, estimated by the Joint Military Mission for Aid to
                                Turkey at approximately $800 million, would be additional to the
                                billion dollar program referred to above. By an aide-mémoire dated

                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> goals,” but there has been
                                no common agreement between the countries as to the amount and rate
                                of this increase. Nevertheless, the Turks consider that the US
                                Government has made a firm commitment and, based chiefly upon the
                                US-Turkish conversations, have in mind as implicit in the commitment
                                the Joint Military Mission for Aid to Turkey $800 million four-year
                                program. While the qualitative improvement of the Turkish Army along
                                these lines would seem to be desirable from a strictly military
                                point of view, implementation of such a program is open to question
                                at the moment because of the lack of available US funds when global
                                military assistance commitments are taken into account, and because
                                of the impact of such a program on Turkish economy and the
                                questionable ability of the Turkish armed forces to convert to
                                greater mechanization so rapidly.</p>

                                money which can be made available for the Fiscal Years 1955 and 1956
                                would be something less than $300 million, and may be substantially
                                lower, as compared with the over $600 million which would be
                                required if the material called for by the $800 million augmentation

                                only at the expense of other military or economic assistance
                                programs under already-approved policies, or by supplemental

                                Expenditures of this magnitude by Turkey from her own resources
                                beginning in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1959 are unlikely.
                                Consequently, there would be required a considerably higher level of
                                US economic assistance than the $70 million currently programmed. It
                                is estimated that total US aid, military and economic, might run as
                                high as $200 million per year. In connection with the ability of the
                                Turkish armed forces rapidly to absorb an augmented program, there
                                are indications that the Turks will have increasing difficulty in
                                maintaining equipment because of inadequate numbers of trained
                                technical personnel and insufficient warehousing and maintenance
                                facilities, as well as the general low level of experience in
                                logistics management. Correction of these deficiencies will require
                                considerable effort.</p>
                            <p>11. The Turks have attempted to carry out an economic revolution
                                comparable to their social and political revolution, but their
                                eagerness to modernize the country, combined with their unhesitating
                                acceptance of military force goals suggested for them by <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the United States, has
                                brought serious economic difficulties. In the early post-war years
                                considerable economic progress was made and productivity increased
                                substantially, in large part as a result of US aid and a succession
                                of good crop years. However, Turkey has increasingly lived beyond
                                its means; with the result that in the last two years foreign
                                exchange resources have been exhausted, a burdensome external debt
                                has been accumulated, and inflation has developed internally.
                                Imports have been stimulated by foreign firms seeking markets, by
                                importers’ hopes for quick profits spurred by the rising price
                                level, and under the assumption that there would be a continuing US
                                support of the Turkish economy. By and large, exports are no longer
                                competitive in world markets, domestic private capital can no longer
                                be successfully channeled into the most productive uses, and foreign
                                investors are now unwilling to risk much long-term capital in
                                Turkey, even though the Government has passed legislation highly
                                favorable to private enterprise and foreign capital. In the last six
                                months Turkey’s situation has been aggravated still further by a
                                serious crop failure which has compelled Turkey, recently an
                                exporter of wheat, to import cereals. At the same time, <pb n="625"
                                    xml:id="pg_625" facs="0655"/>European suppliers are becoming
                                less anxious to extend further commercial credits. Thus, the time
                                appears to be approaching when Turkish imports may decline as
                                suppliers cease to ship until paid in cash.</p>
                            <p>12. The restoration of economic stability in Turkey and the
                                maintenance of a sound economic development program will require
                                either curtailment of the total rate of investment or the level of
                                military expenditures, or both, unless the gap is met by additional
                                aid from abroad.<note n="14" xml:id="d320fn14">New crises could be
                                    expected to develop even with increased aid unless the Turkish
                                    Government applied more restraint than it has been willing to
                                    apply up to this time in the field of credit and investment.
                                    [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Most, if not all, of the
                                adjustment needed to restore stability at the present level of US
                                military and economic aid and the present level of Turkish defense
                                spending could be obtained through fiscal and financial measures
                                which would reduce investment and curtail credit but still allow a
                                reasonable rate of economic progress. The problem is that the
                                Turkish Government, while it has made some gestures in the direction
                                of controlling inflationary pressures, has been reluctant to
                                recognize the seriousness of the situation and to accept reasonable
                                limitations on the rate of economic development. The Turkish
                                Government has already turned to the United States in an attempt to
                                obtain additional aid, and Turkish officials have taken the position
                                that the US is committed to extend Turkey a $300 million loan. The
                                US has made no such commitment. In this situation we must expect
                                continued difficulty in persuading the Turkish Government to take
                                the necessary actions. In view of Turkey’s special position as a
                                staunch ally which has consistently withstood Soviet threats, the US
                                must consider carefully the effect of pressures and actions that
                                would offend Turkish pride and adversely affect this basic
                                US-Turkish relationship.</p>

                                Such agreements should provide for (a) integrated Southeastern

                                to meet its minimum essential civilian and military

                            <p>22. a. In dealing with the impending economic crisis, rely primarily
                                upon Turkey’s taking the necessary fiscal and financial measures,
                                and in particular to limit the rate of its economic development to

                                provide economic and technical assistance at approximately existing
                                levels, but do not agree under present circumstances to extend a

                            <p>c. Upon determination of the extent of US military assistance
                                pursuant to para. 20 above and upon adoption by Turkey of the
                                necessary fiscal and financial measures (subpara, a above), provide
                                economic assistance based on the amount required to permit Turkey to
                                fulfill its military program as approved by the US, while still
                                allowing Turkey to carry out a reasonable economic development
                                program.</p>
                            <p>23. Continue to encourage Turkey to improve the climate for
                                investment in Turkey of both foreign and domestic private
                                capital.</p>

                                stabilizing influence on the Arab States.</p>

                            attainment of investment and defense goals in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In an effort, therefore, to assist the Turkish Government in improving
                            its economic and financial position, this Government readily acceded to

                            on Turkish Economic Problems, composed of representatives from the

                            he would consider. The Prime Minister subsequently agreed, however, that

                            bitterness over the “imperious approach”, the Turks have decided to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> opened the meeting
                            stating that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> had
                            expected to attend this meeting on the Turkish problem but,
                            unfortunately, had had to leave for the West Coast a few hours earlier.
                            He explained that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> had
                            arrived in Washington Tuesday afternoon and would be available Thursday,
                            Friday, and Saturday morning for meetings with representatives of the
                            Department of State and other agencies. He then called on Mr.
                                <persName>Young</persName> to make a brief summary presentation of
                            the conclusions of the Inter-Agency Committee on Turkish Economic
                            Problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Young</persName> referred to a secret document, prepared by
                            the Committee, on “US Aid to Turkey”, dated May 17, 1955, <note n="4"
                                xml:id="d324fn4">In January 1955, a US Interagency Committee on
                                Turkish Economic Problems, composed of representatives of the
                                Departments of State, the Treasury, and Defense held its first
                                meeting. The report is not further identified.</note> which had been
                            circulated to all those present and called attention especially to the
                            summary, the conclusions on Page 2 of the document, as well as the
                            measures needed to achieve economic and financial stability, noting
                            specifically the points covered on Page 6. The general areas in which
                            reforms were needed, he pointed out, were: (1) qualitative and
                            quantitative control by the Central Bank over credit; (2) bringing the
                            over-all budget into approximate balance, including expenditures for
                            State enterprises; (3) measures to expand the export of Turkish products
                            and to improve “the competitive position of Turkish exports on the world
                            market” (This point, he explained, was a subtle way of referring to
                            devaluation.); and (4) eventual elimination of control of imports and
                            foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Young</persName> then explained that he had discussed the
                            aforementioned points informally with International Monetary Fund
                            representatives who agreed with them. He had also learned that the
                            I.M.F. expects to send a mission of experts to Turkey on June 2, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CHM1">Merle Cochran</persName>, who will head
                            the mission, will arrive in Turkey on June 16 for a stay of ten days or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>In opening the discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1"
                                >Overby</persName> stated that the problem before the group as he
                            saw it was to determine what defense forces we want the Turks to
                            maintain and how much we are willing to pay for them. Also, can that
                            amount be found in the Defense Department <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634"
                                facs="0664"/>budget? This was a problem he considered primarily a
                            Defense Department responsibility. He did not think the Turks would, for
                            political reasons, be prepared to cut back their development program. …
                            In response to a question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName>, he stated that he did not believe a loan in any
                            traditional sense was a good or wise, or even a desirable, solution. The
                            Turkish defense problem will go on for years and it would be a
                            disservice to give them a loan. He wished to emphasize particularly that
                            we do not want to bail out Turkey’s short-term European creditors. Any
                            aid we give should be closely associated with Turkey’s defense effort.
                            He indicated that after we decide how much aid we will give them for
                            defense, the Turks will have to negotiate whatever extensions are
                            necessary with their European creditors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> pointed out that the
                            Department’s interest in extending extraordinary aid to Turkey was based
                            on the Turkish military posture as the eastern anchor of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and a pivotal country in Middle East
                            defense arrangements. It was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName>’s understanding that a reduction in the numbers of
                            the Turkish Army would not greatly reduce their defense budget and would
                            not extricate them from their present serious troubles. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> picked up this theme and noted
                            that 1954 actual figures (shown on Table 1 of Mr.
                                <persName>Young</persName>’s paper) indicated that total defense
                            expenditures ran 912 million Turkish liras, whereas the total amount
                            devoted to investment (in the economy, not limited to government
                            expenditures) was 2,236 million liras. He, for one, was most anxious to
                            wait for the Holcombe Study with its analysis of what the Turkish
                            economy could support. He, in principle, did not believe the US could go
                            on indefinitely supporting forces beyond the means of the country. As
                            concerns the expenditures associated with the proposed additional 800
                            million dollars end-item program referred to in the
                                <persName>Young</persName> report, he noted that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff had never given that “commitment” its entire blessing, and there
                            was considerable doubt in the Defense Department as to whether Turkey
                            could effectively operate a “modernized” army equipped with this
                            additional material.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked whether the
                            US Government had recommended devaluation to any other countries in so
                            many words, it was pointed out that this step had been taken in a few
                            cases such as Korea, but that usually such advice was given in a veiled
                            way by pointing out that the country was “over-importing and
                            underexporting”. Mr. <persName>Young</persName> warned against the US
                            having to take the blame publicly for devaluation, especially in the
                            light of the strong Turkish Government stand on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName> said that his
                            answer to the question of where the money to aid Turkey is to come from,
                            is that he does not know unless Congress is asked for a supplemental
                            appropriation. Mr. <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0665"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> said he felt such a request
                            would be unwise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName>
                            then pointed to the very real short-term problems, such as payment for
                            oil imports, and the slow-down in certain manufacturing and processing
                            industries due to a lack of imported raw materials. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWO1">Baxter</persName>, at this point, stated that
                            Socony, he had just heard, had been given oral assurances that a
                            confirmed letter of credit would be opened by the end of May for June
                            shipments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName> then
                            stated that on the longer pull he was fairly pessimistic about the
                            adequacy of the estimates of both the Embassy and the
                                <persName>Young</persName> Committee unless there were substantial
                            cuts in the defense and investment programs. He considered the price tag
                            for economic aid to carry on both programs at present levels might be
                            between 800 million and a billion dollars over five years.</p>
                        <p>A brief discussion took place about the excellent results achieved in
                            Greece following a sharp devaluation preceded by an effective economic
                            stabilization program. Broad aspects of devaluation, investment and
                            hoarding were also touched upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> then reiterated that
                            none of the conditional commitment made last June for one-quarter of the
                            800 million dollars in hardware had as yet been met, and that in the 1.4
                            billion military aid program for Fiscal Year 1956 there was no
                            additional money earmarked for Turkey. It was always possible to find
                            money within the program for the most pressing military problems, but
                            this always had to be done at the expense of other country programs. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> stated that it was
                            really a question of the priority to be given Turkey. He then asked if
                            the Turks had been informed that a $300 million loan was not in the
                            cards. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> replied “no”
                            …</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> then asked whether the
                            US Government was trying to get the Turks to cut their investment
                            program because such a cut will be beneficial or because we are trying
                            to find an excuse to refuse aid. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1"
                                >Hensel</persName> replied we could find the money if it would help
                            but without a stable economy, more aid would just be swallowed in the
                            whirlpool. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> continued
                            that Turkish force goals are illusory if the Turkish economy is not able
                            to support the defense establishment planned. It would be in an unsound
                            military position unless supported for the most part by the country’s
                            own resources. At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWO1"
                                >Baxter</persName> noted that in the cases of both Greece and Turkey
                            it had always been the US Government’s understanding that we expected to
                            have to supply end item aid and spare parts over a considerable period
                            of time to maintain the desired level of forces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> also commented that
                            Turks have seen this economic crisis coming on for some time and he felt
                            that it was quite proper for the Department of State to be frank with
                            the Turks. At that point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1"
                                >Hensel</persName> raised the question of an adjustment in the <pb
                                n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0666"/>exchange rate and placing US
                            personnel abroad on a gold payment basis. This problem, if raised by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>, he thought might be an
                            indirect hint to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> of a
                            need for devaluation. In response to a question as to what the Embassy’s
                            views were on this problem, Miss Milne said that latest information was
                            that the Embassy, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USOMT1">USOM/T</gloss> did not feel the Turkish
                            Government should be approached on this question at present, but that it
                            should be settled only as a part of an across-the-board exchange rate
                            change.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> then raised the question
                            as to what tactics should be followed in case Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> agreed to our “conditions”
                            concerning a modification of the investment program, a tightening up of
                            credit, balancing of the over-all budget, control of imports, and
                            possibly even devaluation. Should we, in response to his request for a
                            loan on this basis, meet a request for perhaps $80 million to meet the
                            immediate crisis? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName>
                            believed that if the Turkish Government was prepared to meet the
                            conditions, and adequate assurances could be given to the US Government
                            concerning their sincerity, we should say that we would use our best
                            efforts to obtain additional aid for them. We would have to so space
                            this aid that it would depend on Turkish performance. … Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> stated that he would help if we
                            can get the right commitments.</p>
                        <p>At this point, discussion took place about the “high-level mission to
                            Turkey” and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> both questioned the
                            desirability of such a mission. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_OAN1"
                                >Overby</persName> believed that the decision on this matter had to
                            be made in Washington and that the Turks know what to do as far as
                            economic measures are concerned and will do it when they have learned
                            that they will get only X amount of money and no more from the US He
                            again stressed that the US should make it clear that we will give no aid
                            to bail them out with their European creditors. The group agreed that
                            any financial stabilization program must include a provision that the
                            Turks must fund their current short-term debts. In response to a
                            question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> as to
                            whether any additional aid should be handled through the present
                            machinery in Ankara or by a special group, it was the consensus that the
                            present team in Ankara, strengthened by the necessary additional
                            technicians, could best do the work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> then asked what his line
                            should be with the oil companies if they threatened to discontinue oil
                            shipments to Turkey. It was generally felt that State should take a firm
                            line on this problem and inform the oil companies, if they inquire, that
                            it was entirely their decision to make as to whether oil should be
                            shipped to Turkey beyond what the Turks could pay for, and that their
                            decision should be based on purely commercial reasons. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHS1">Hensel</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> proposed that very much
                            the same group meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> at one of the meetings scheduled before Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>’s departure. It was
                            considered best to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                            and State representatives meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> at a first meeting and that the remainder of the
                            committee would be on call for a further meeting if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> considered it desirable.</p>
                        <p>In a brief discussion as to the desirability of requesting Congress for
                            additional aid to Turkey, it was considered that it would be undesirable
                            because the presentation on the aid legislation is now well under way …
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGDA1">FitzGerald</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName> considered that aid in grant
                            form was preferable to a “hard” loan. There was then some discussion of
                            the possibility of some form of “soft loan”.</p>

                                of conversation of the meeting has been found.</note> Secretary
                            opened and closed discussion with warm expression appreciation excellent
                            work of Turks at Bandung. Re Turkish economic situation he said both
                            Turkey and United States want to see sound Turkish economy on which to
                            base strong Turkish army. However $300 million loan far exceeded any
                            amount that might be considered. If any additional aid proved feasible
                            amount would be far less. Secretary stressed that prerequisite to any
                            additional aid would be United States satisfaction that present
                            difficulties not of recurring nature. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> assured Secretary “Draconian” measures would be
                            taken to meet emergency. <note n="6" xml:id="d325fn6">In a May 19

                                    <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> was required. All
                                reportedly agreed that an “eventual showdown” was unavoidable and
                                believed that it would be better if it occurred now than in the
                                future when the situation might have deteriorated further.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> asked to see Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> for a private
                            discussion without the presence of a large working group.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> opened the conversation
                            by expressing the strong hope that we would avoid any inter-relation
                            between consideration <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0670"/>of
                            Turkey’s loan request and the forthcoming mission to Turkey of the
                            International Monetary Fund. The <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            group would go out in June; it would spend several weeks in Turkey; then
                            it would prepare a report. This whole process might take several months,
                            and the situation in Turkey called for immediate action, as the next few
                            weeks were crucial. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            visit was a routine annual affair and should be kept separate from the
                            need for extraordinary assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> felt that we were not making much progress and
                            wondered just what procedure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName> would suggest for reaching a quick decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> regretted the necessity
                            to agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> that we
                            weren’t making much progress. There appeared to be a fundamental
                            difference of opinion between the Turkish Government and the United
                            States Government as to the nature of the present economic crisis in
                            Turkey and the methods by which it might be improved. As Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> had heard personally from the
                            Secretary the day before, the figure of $300 million was far in excess
                            of anything which the United States could do, and, if extraordinary
                            assistance in a lesser amount should prove feasible, it would have to be
                            coupled with additional measures taken by the Turkish Government to
                            insure that the present situation would not recur year after year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> said he thought there
                            should be some way to get out of the vicious circle of talks on the
                            technical level. He believed that many of the technicians were too
                            theoretical and tried to follow text-books without knowing the realities
                            of European trade or of the particularities of Turkish economy. They all
                            made a great issue of inflation, without understanding that there was no
                            inflation in the usual sense of the word in Turkey, where 85 percent of
                            the population had very little cash income and where importers’ goods
                            represented only 5 percent of the outlay of the average Turkish peasant.
                            The technicians also talked as if Turkey were expanding its investment
                            program, whereas it was in fact only finishing projects already started
                            and had no intention of starting new ones. He believed too much emphasis
                            had been given to our differences of opinion instead of to the large
                            areas of agreement. The Turkish Government realized that it must try to
                            get a balanced budget and was working to that end; it was also carrying
                            out necessary credit policies and intended to slow down the rate of
                            development in the future. Details on all of these matters could be
                            worked out satisfactorily, he felt sure, but the first important thing
                            to do was to establish the amount of the loan which the United States
                            could make and then discuss how matters could be worked out. If the
                            United States felt it could not extend a loan of $300 million, it
                            certainly must have some figure in mind which it was prepared to make
                            available. If the Turkish Government could know what <pb n="641"
                                xml:id="pg_641" facs="0671"/>amount the United States had in mind,
                            it could then decide what measures it must take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that, if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> wanted to know the
                            answer as to what amount the United States could make available at this
                            time and in the present circumstances, he must answer frankly that the
                            answer was none. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                            explained that, though he had done most of the talking with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>, he thought he had reflected
                            accurately the view of other agencies—which is that any extraordinary
                            aid we might find available would have to be accompanied by
                            extraordinary measures instituted by the Turkish Government to get its
                            economy on a sounder basis.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> said that,
                            if this was the answer, he would have to tell his Government that the
                            United States would not help Turkey in its time of need.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that, though it was
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>’s privilege to report
                            to his Government in any fashion he saw fit, he believed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> would be making a mistake if he
                            gave the impression that the United States was not interested in the
                            future of Turkey or in helping Turkey as much as it could. The United
                            States attaches great importance to the close and friendly relations
                            between our two countries and is eager, as is Turkey, for Turkey to be
                            strengthened in every way to play a major role in the area and in the
                            defense of the free world. However, there is an honest difference of
                            opinion as to how that strength may be achieved. We are not convinced
                            that the remedy proposed by the Turkish Government is the one which will
                            achieve the desired results, and, as the Turkish Government is asking
                            United States assistance, it is unfortunately up to the Turkish
                            Government to convince us that its policies are those which in our
                            opinion will overcome the present economic difficulties and not allow
                            them to become a chronic element in Turkish economic life.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> stated vehemently that
                            the aid problem had always been kept separate from the broader and more
                            important relationships between the two countries. No matter what the
                            United States decision might be on the loan request, it would not be
                            permitted to jeopardize cordial United States-Turkish relations, nor
                            would Turkey reduce its defense effort, which it maintained for its own
                            security as well as for the contribution it could make to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the free world. He believed,
                            however, that the United States would not be acting in its own best
                            interests if it made a decision which would weaken a country so
                            important to the free world and to United States objectives as is
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> asked if he were correct
                            in inferring that the Turkish Government felt that its present economic
                            difficulties were in large measure due to bad luck, specifically the
                            crop failure of a year ago. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> indicated the essential accuracy of this
                            statement, <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0672"/>Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that he feared the United
                            States view was that Turkey could have taken steps which would have
                            prepared it to be in a stronger position to meet such natural disasters,
                            and that measures had not yet been taken which would prevent the present
                            difficulties from recurring. Therefore, to answer Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>’s question as to what size of
                            loan might be feasible, he must state frankly that, in the
                            circumstances, he could see no source for any funds.</p>
                        <p>In referring several times to measures which the Turkish Government would
                            take to improve the economic situation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> had taken the position that those could not be
                            decided upon or usefully discussed until the size of the United States
                            loan was known; otherwise, the Turkish Government would not have the
                            basis on which to determine what steps should be taken and how drastic
                            they should be. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EM1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> had indicated that Mr. <persName

                            measures with a small group of high American officials, but, of course,
                            because of their delicate nature, he could not be expected to talk them
                            over with a large working group. It was, therefore, agreed at the close
                            of the conversation that a meeting would be arranged early next week at

                            such questions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>,

                            at that time, as his views would necessarily be dependent on the
                            Holcombe report, which will not be received in Washington until the
                            latter part of next week.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the conversation Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> frequently referred to the fact that <gloss

                            projects, had the effect of pushing Turkey toward further development.
                            Such sources of assistance were not required in the present situation.
                            What the Turkish Government really needed was a cash loan (fonds de

                            Turkey; its brave stand on defense in a perilous advanced position was
                            an inspiration to the rest of the world. When we go to the Hill on
                            defense matters, the Secretary said, Turkey is our No. 1 exhibit.
                            Probably Turkey has been foolish and over-ambitious in offering to carry
                            a much larger defense burden than it should support, but in general we
                            and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">Nato</gloss> have eagerly accepted their
                            proffers and shouted “stout fellow.” And Turkey might say, with some
                            justification, that its efforts in another direction have made a start
                            on Middle East defense arrangements—where the combined efforts of the
                            US, the UK, and France failed miserably. Turkey is looked upon as our
                            chosen vessel. If it falls flat on its face <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644"

                            own bad management), other countries, particularly those of the Middle
                            East, will wonder just how much US support is worth. …</p>

                        <p>I think we should face up to the fact that Turkey is going to cost us
                            considerably more for the next few years than we had thought. Instead of
                            trying to decide on the magnitude of an “accommodation,” should we not
                            agree internally that our regular aid be increased and then, by sitting
                            down with the Turkish and figuring out their requirements for the next
                            two or three months, say, and then for the next six months or so, get
                            them to institute the drastic measures we think necessary in direct
                            connection with the release of funds for specific obligations. (I’m
                            getting fuzzy here, but I think some of our qualified people in
                            Treasury, the Department and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> could
                            spell out a program.)</p>
                        <p>Sorry for the early morning aberration, but this problem has been keeping
                            me awake of nights. It’s one that has to be solved, not by-passed, and I
                            can’t yet see the way through it.</p>

                        <p>1519. Last Sunday night Istanbul when I was arranging with Prime Minister
                            for release four American airmen still under charges of desecration of
                            Turkish flag on Turkish Independence Day at Izmir, I inquired concerning
                            the progress of <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>’s
                            conversations in Washington. I had not then seen the Department’s
                            memoranda of conversations of May 18, 19, 20 and 21. <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d328fn2">See <ref target="#d325">Documents 325</ref> and

                                indicates that the first meeting was on May 19.</note> The Prime
                            Minister was depressed.</p>
                        <p>He said that there was no positive reaction from any of the American
                            officials to the suggestions <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> advanced for putting the <pb n="645"
                                xml:id="pg_645" facs="0675"/>Turkish financial and economic house in
                            order. I ventured that the study of the Holcombe report was not yet
                            completed in Washington and that in my opinion the American position on
                            what might be done with Turkey at this time could not be expected to be
                            firmed up until that analysis was finished and related to other studies
                            that have been under way during the past several months. The Prime
                            Minister rejoined that meanwhile the situation on Turkey is
                            deteriorating rapidly both financially and politically.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed the petroleum situation. The Prime Minister said he was
                            following it closely and realized that unless he is able to do something
                            positive in meeting the petroleum companies requirements for firm
                            letters of credit before any further petroleum shipments are made
                            supplies in the country will be exhausted by June 30. He had hoped to
                            borrow $11,000,000 from the International Monetary Fund to tide him over
                            this emergency but there had been delays in working this out with the
                            IMFT and he feels that even if the loan were available it would be too
                            little and too late to meet the country’s requirements following harvest
                            and transport during the season that is already under way.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was also depressed about the political situation. He
                            said that Kalim Gulek, Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_RPP1"
                                >RPP</gloss>, was that very day, last Sunday, addressing a meeting
                            of some 3,000 persons in Izmir, alleging that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> Government is incompetent to
                            manage the country’s economic affairs and has already brought the
                            economy to the brink of disaster. Given the fact that this government
                            still has three years to go before a general election, the Prime
                            Minister says the country and its friends now face the risk of having to
                            work with a government whose people become upset in a national sense,
                            there is no telling what may happen. He said he is taking to the
                            countryside immediately to answer these attacks but he believes the
                            effects of these inter changes of polemics will do nobody good unless it
                            is the Soviet.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired, since I had not yet seen the memoranda above mentioned,
                            whether the Prime Minister considered recalling <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> and having Gork request the
                            American Government to send a high level team immediately to Turkey to
                            inquire into the situation here and to try to work out recommendations
                            on how best to meet the situation. It may be recalled that this proposal
                            was being considered favorably when I left Washington early May. The
                            Prime Minister said he is prepared to do anything to ease the situation
                            and I inferred that such a request would be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that if such a request is made it be entertained seriously.
                            In my opinion no good purpose will be served if the opposing Turkish
                            political parties wrangle throughout the countryside this summer over
                            the responsibilities of their current economic <pb n="646"
                                xml:id="pg_646" facs="0676"/>and financial crisis. Inevitably the
                            United States will be drawn into the picture by adverse press comment.
                            The only effective way to control this, in my opinion, is to have the
                            Americans visit take place, with an understanding from both principal
                            political parties that now is not the time for recriminations. I believe
                            it possible to get such an understanding from the opposition party
                            although relationships between the government and the opposition have
                            deteriorated within the last two weeks, largely on account of some
                            personal animus between the leaders.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Max Thornburg, who saw the Prime Minister after I did Sunday,
                            was instructed to get on with his studies. <note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3"
                                >On July 15, Max Thornburg, a private American industrial
                                consultant, completed his report on the economic situation in
                                Turkey, which had been requested by the Government of Turkey.
                                (Transmitted in despatch 126, September 29; Department of State,
                                Central Files, 882.00/9–2955) In telegram 169, August 8, the Embassy
                                in Ankara reported that <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                    >Menderes</persName> had called Thornburg in to discuss the
                                report and disputed Thornburg’s findings and recommendations. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 882.00/8–855) Thornburg’s report
                                concluded that no American loan could be obtained until Turkey
                                strengthened its economic administration.</note> He had an
                            intimation that the Prime Minister is convinced he should set up a
                            special commission for economic and financial control and management and
                            I gather he may want Thornburg either to head it or be the Secretary
                            General. The indication to Thornburg was that if such an organization
                            were undertaken it would probably have to continue for several years
                            until the country’s economy was on its feet and until there was an
                            integration of planning and coordination with respect to the public and
                            private sectors in the Turkish economy.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> during the past few
                            weeks and assured him that the Turkish economic situation and the views
                            of the Turkish Government had been given most serious and sympathetic
                            consideration in all branches of this Government. The question had been
                            taken up yesterday by the highest level officers of State, Defense,
                            Treasury and <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>, and the decision made
                            by them had only this morning been cleared with the President. The final
                            position of the United States Government was set forth in a letter which
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> read aloud and then
                            handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> (copy
                                attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d329fn2">Dated June 8, from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>, not printed. The letter
                                indicated that the United States was prepared to increase its
                                economic aid to Turkey from $70 million to $100 million. It also
                                noted that this assistance would be extended “in the confident
                                expectation that the Turkish Government will take every remedial
                                step in its power, along lines which have been brought out during
                                our discussions.” Regarding the loan requested by the Turkish
                                Government, the letter noted that the United States believed that
                                “the incurring of additional financial obligations by the Turkish
                                Government at this time would not be a remedial measure likely to
                                prevent a recurrence of economic and financial
                            difficulties.”</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> asked if he was correct
                            in understanding that the Turkish request for a loan was rejected. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> confirmed this fact.
                            After most careful examination of the Turkish situation, he said, the
                            United States could not recommend to the Congress a course of action
                            that would involve Turkey in further international financial commitments
                            that in our opinion would not be remedial in nature nor prevent the
                            present situation from recurring in the near future. He wished to stress
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> that we were most
                            sympathetic with regard to the present difficulties and with the Turkish
                            wish to develop industrial potentials and improve the standard <pb
                                n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0678"/>of living of the Turkish
                            people. However, there was an honest difference of opinion between our
                            two Governments as to how such an aim could be achieved. It was the view
                            of the Turkish Government that a large cash loan was required, whereas
                            the United States Government felt that this would only postpone the
                            remedial measures which the Turkish Government must take to get its
                            economy on a sound footing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> said he wished to
                            express the thanks of the Turkish Government for this offer of
                            additional grant aid. It was a substantial amount which would be of
                            assistance in the coming months. He was touched by this proof of United
                            States friendship for his country. However, while he and his Government
                            were thankful, they could not be “happy,” as this was not the reply he
                            had hoped to get. He believed that the magnitude of the problem and the
                            great potentialities for strength in Turkey called for a large loan at
                            this time. He summarized many of the arguments he had advanced in
                            previous discussions, pointing out that Turkey had requested a loan
                            rather than additional aid in the belief that it would be easier for the
                            United States and that it would be an indication of Turkey’s intention
                            of standing on its own feet. He also made clear that Turkey had never
                            tried to bargain or to threaten that it would cut back its defense
                            effort if the loan were not forthcoming. “Turkey will keep its
                            twenty-five divisions,” he stated flatly, and expressed the opinion that
                            they were worth something to the United States. He felt he must point
                            out, however, that this decision will come as a great shock to his
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EM1">Esenbel</persName> then urged that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> loan guarantee provision be exercised
                            at once in connection with Turkey’s current obligations to the American
                            oil companies. Such a suggested solution had been discussed with the oil
                            companies in Ankara and had been forwarded by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> Mission to Washington, where it was
                            turned down. It was pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EM1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> that the loan guarantee provision had been
                            written into <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> legislation by the
                            Congress with the aim of encouraging new investment abroad and not with
                            the <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">idea</gloss> of “bailing out” debts to
                            existing American enterprises. Furthermore, it was not <gloss
                                target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss> policy to finance oil purchases or to
                            guarantee loans for oil. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> said that one exception he knew had been made in
                            the case of Greece. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                            promised that this question would be taken under consideration.</p>

                            there was an opportunity for a brief exchange with Mr. <persName

                            have to be measures taken by the Turkish Government, to work out of the
                            present difficulties into a firm economic position.</p>

                            Gork has endeavored to reopen talks on economic aid as if conversations
                            held with <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> had merely been
                            suspended temporarily without any definite conclusion having been
                            reached regarding $300,000,000 loan request. He has been informed in
                            clearest terms that request for loan was very definitely refused and
                            that we are not aware of any basis for reopening any talks regarding
                            extraordinary aid until such time as measures discussed with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> to correct basic causes for
                            Turkey’s economic difficulties have been put into effect and have shown
                            results. …</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> emphasized that Turkey
                            would have to tailor its economic development program to fit its
                            capabilities without relying on unjustifiable expectations of foreign
                            aid. If Turks still expected to obtain large loan from US, they were
                            entirely unrealistic. He said he thought $30,000,000 of additional aid
                            found for Turkey last month should permit Turkey to use its foreign
                            exchange resources to meet, for example, its pressing petroleum
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Gork was reminded that in current aid proposals before
                            Congress, per capita provision for economic aid to Turkey would be about
                            $3.50, for <gloss target="#t_Paks1">Paks</gloss> about $1.00, and for
                            India about $.30. This was indication of importance we attach to Turkish
                            economic development.</p>

                        <p>I. After an exchange of pleasantries, in an appropriate way, there was an
                            opportunity for the Secretary to advise the Prime Minister that the
                            request for a $300 million loan had been definitely refused and that no
                            such loan was either possible or in contemplation. The reason why this
                            was so was explained by pointing out the extreme burdens which the US
                            had assumed; a somewhat unbalanced budget situation with loss of
                            reserves; tax reduction resulting in decreased revenues and from a
                            financial point of view balancing its expenditures with its demands with
                            its income to protect its own economic situation even to the point of
                            the most careful scrutiny of the most minor items, down to every million
                            dollars or less. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                            then explained that we were obligated to accomplish 64 countries in
                            varying degrees and that he was under the strictest obligation to
                            consider proper distribution of his funds among the countries so that
                            every minor item required the most careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then continued to explain that although the $300 million
                            loan was impossible, both now and for the foreseeable future, that we
                            were very proud of our association with Turkey; we regarded them as one
                            of our most important partners in the preservation of the free world,
                            and that we had every intention of supporting them to the limit of our
                            ability, both militarily and economically, in about the area of past
                            years’ performance. However, such support would be undoubtedly declining
                            as time went on and as our necessities and burdens became greater; that
                            we thought it was only fair with a good partner to be perfectly frank
                            with each other so that our partnership might endure on a firm and free
                            basis, each knowing what to expect of the other and not to be deceived
                            into impossible positions. It was further explained that all nations in
                            the world are now facing the most difficult problem of balancing their
                            military expenditures which they could afford with what their economy
                            could support and that this was just as true of the US with <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0681"/>its tremendous obligations as it was
                            with Turkey. While we did not feel that our aid must terminate suddenly,
                            nevertheless the time was approaching when all partners would have to be
                            more nearly self-sufficient and balanced in their own economies. He
                            explained that we were willing and anxious to proceed as rapidly as
                            possible with determination of aid and in exact amounts and, to that
                            end, we suggested information which we desired the Turkish Government to
                            give to us to help us formulate our views; that there would be military
                            matters discussed with the military; and economic information requested
                            by the Ambassador, and as soon as the information from these various
                            sources and particularly from them was available to us for study and
                            consideration, we would look forward to meeting with them in Washington
                            with all concerned to get the matter reduced to final figures. But that
                            for the present and for today, all we can do is to reassure them of our
                            intense support in their affairs; of how proud we were to be associated
                            with them; and request that they proceed to help us reach a conclusion
                            so that we both might have a definite basis for making plans for the
                            immediate future. The Prime Minister responded with very complimentary
                            comments of appreciation for past performances and hope for the future.
                            There could be no possible misunderstanding that $300 million was not in
                            the offing and that we were to resume conclusion of our mutual affairs
                            in the area of previous performance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> stated that in the
                            distribution of the funds available for the foreign aid program, the
                            public relations was an important matter and that the events of the past
                            few days in Turkey had raised some very serious questions, when a few
                            hours of destruction might bring about loss equivalent to a whole year’s
                            aid program.<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">On September 6 and 7, a series
                                of violent anti-Greek and anti-minority rioting erupted in Istanbul
                                and Izmir. The riots, primarily anti-Greek in character, resulted in
                                widespread damage and destruction to Greek churches, shops, and
                                other establishments.</note> It was obvious that our country must
                            see the whole picture in a new light before reaching any definite
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated that he regretted exceedingly the recent
                            happenings and that it was his belief that the riots were largely the
                            result of Communist activities and that the Government expected to take
                            all necessary measures.</p>
                        <p>II. Just prior to lunch with the President, <note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_BC1">Celal Bayar</persName>.</note> in
                            the presence of our Ambassador, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                                >Hollister</persName> and General Riley, and the Deputy Secretary
                            General of the Foreign Office, and part of the time the Prime Minister,
                            the President stated pleasantly but bluntly that he was greatly
                            disturbed and his country had been seriously embarrassed by the manner
                            in which their request for the $300 million loan had <pb n="652"
                                xml:id="pg_652" facs="0682"/>been handled and refused; that as a
                            past banker, the method of handling the refusal of a loan was of prime
                            importance to him. He referred specifically to the AP release on the
                            subject from Washington and the embarrassment which its publication had
                            caused him and his Government. … The Secretary told the President that
                            we had had a long and fruitful discussion with the Prime Minister,
                            during which we had gone into full details with respect to the $300
                            million loan and all of the reasons why it was not possible to grant it.
                            He explained that if in the handling of the matter there had been some
                            embarrassment to him or his government, he had our humble apology and
                            our assurance that it would not be repeated, but as to the merits of the
                            case, there was no doubt in our minds that the matter was closed and
                            would not be reopened and we requested the Prime Minister to explain the
                            matter fully to the President and ask that he give him time to do so. As
                            others are waiting for luncheon, there was no time to get into this at
                            the moment. The Prime Minister agreed to do this and you may rest
                            assured he will do this. We then proceeded to lunch and had a very
                            agreeable time. The President was very affable. There were 16 top
                            officials (12 Turks and our party of 4) present. After luncheon the
                            Secretary asked the President for another five minutes of serious
                            discussion. It was immediately granted, and he, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and an interpreter stepped
                            into another office with the President.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary again explained to the President his regret that any
                            embarrassment had been caused and he assured him of our great pride in
                            association with him; that our desire to cooperate in every way within
                            our powers, but everything we had said about the reasons why increased
                            aid could not be granted was reinforced and we again requested that he
                            very carefully consider the reasons we had so meticulously given to the
                            Prime Minister, which we asked him again to allow the Prime Minister to
                            explain at length to the President. The meeting ended with relations in
                            a cordial vein.</p>

                            the Secretary anything that was on his mind relating to relationships
                            between the two countries in the fields of finance and economics. The
                            President then replied under the circumstances he would be very pleased
                            to <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0683"/>extend an invitation but
                            that he intended not to hold his fire and to say everything that was on
                            his mind. The President’s blunt, and at the same time agreeable,
                            approach to the Secretary on meeting him before the luncheon, was the
                            carrying out of the President’s intentions.</p>
                        <p>In conversation after lunch the President stated that it was his belief
                            that higher authorities in Washington did not appreciate Turkey’s
                            position, and that they were being misled by reports that did not take
                            into account the broader views of the relations between the two
                            countries and Turkey’s strategic position in the world. The Secretary
                            assured the President that he was misinformed on this subject and
                            absolutely wrong and that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and the highest authorities in Washington,
                            all were fully aware of real conditions and they were not misled, and
                            that the loan was impossible because of definite conditions affecting
                            the US and its obligations. It was well understood by everyone in
                            Washington as the Prime Minister would explain in detail to the
                            President. The Secretary further explained that he and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> would cover the whole subject
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> when
                            they saw him within the next few days.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> briefed the Council on the reference
                            Progress Report, stressing the two main problems: the military
                            assistance program and the Turkish financial and economic situation. At
                            the conclusion of his briefing (copy of briefing note filed in the
                            minutes of the meeting), Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> said that he
                            understood Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName>
                            wished to say a few words on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> briefly
                            outlined the present status of the funding of the program of military
                            assistance to Turkey covering the Fiscal Years 1950 through 1956. He
                            pointed out that the funding for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957
                            was now under study. He thereafter read a letter which had been prepared
                            for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> just prior
                            to the latter’s departure for the recent Istanbul Conference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that in
                            view of the fact that the National Security Council was well aware of
                            the difficulties confronting our program of assistance to Turkey in the
                            past, he would confine his comments to the present situation. The State
                            Department felt that the Turks had very good reason to believe that the
                            United States had actually promised them a great deal more than the $200
                            million already provided. Accordingly, the State Department foresaw an
                            excellent chance that the Turks would come to a parting of the ways with
                            the United States if we do not shortly reach a firm agreement with them
                            on the nature and extent of the US commitment to provide military and
                            economic assistance to Turkey. Their economic situation, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>, was extremely
                            serious. The United States must therefore face up to what we are going
                            to do with Turkey within the next three weeks. This $64-question had
                            been posed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            recommended that the Administration take a well-thought-out position in
                            this matter and inform the Turks of this position within the time period
                            he had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> inquired about the
                            course of action in the US policy toward Turkey (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5510/1), which permitted the United States to purchase
                            Turkish chrome for the long-term US stockpile. He also noted that the
                            President had been interested in a more vigorous program of barter to
                            the end of assisting the Turkish economy. There was nothing in the
                            Progress Report on either of these matters, and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> asked if any member of the
                            Council could provide any information about them. He believed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> could do something in this field
                            if the Council so desired.</p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0685"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he had
                            talked with the Turks about the availability of chrome and other
                            materials. The fact of the matter, however, was that the Turks had about
                            reached the limits of their chrome production unless the United States
                            was prepared to provide large capital support to enable the Turks to
                            open additional mines. Such a move might cost the United States $25
                            million in cash. Moreover, the Turks don’t seem very enthusiastic over
                            this prospect, and we have not been able to extract very accurate
                            information on the subject from them.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that, in short,
                            he was to understand that the responsibility for the failure to take
                            these courses of action rested on the Turks rather than on the United
                            States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied
                            in the affirmative, but nevertheless asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> to give him a memorandum on
                            how much elbow-room the <gloss target="#t_ODM1">ODM</gloss> would have
                            to purchase Turkish chrome and other materials for the long-term
                            stockpile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName>, referring to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>’s earlier statement,
                            inquired where the Turks could go if they came to a parting of the ways
                            with the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> replied that he did not think they would “go”
                            anywhere, but that they could cease to be satisfactory allies.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> commented that it
                            was well within the realm of possibility that the Turks would withdraw
                            from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and embrace neutralism. Such
                            moves would greatly embarrass US policy. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to point out that we
                            ourselves were largely responsible for the elevated force goals which
                            the Turks had adopted. Our responsibilities for these force levels
                            stemmed from the fact that our program of military assistance to
                            friendly nations had begun in 1950 on an emergency basis. Accordingly,
                            the Turks now have us over the barrel, and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> confessed that he did not know
                            how we were going to wiggle off the hook.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> expressed strong
                            support for the observations of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName>. He said he believed that the United States was
                            in danger of being accused by its allies and friends of rushing in with
                            all kinds of promises when critical situations arose, and then of
                            leaving its friends in the lurch when the crisis subsided. He believed
                            that we must give some thought to our posture and reputation. We may
                            have to work out something in the way of aid agreements, which did not
                            recommend itself to us as sound from the strict economic point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> stressed that
                            the Defense Department felt that it would be a grave mistake not to keep
                            the Turks tied to us. If they prove to be willing to undertake the
                            necessary economic reforms, we should design a realistic program which
                            would call for another $100 million over and above what we have already
                            given <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0686"/>them, to meet the
                            commitments we have made to Turkey. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> warned, however, that this
                            move could not be made if it was proposed to limit the over-all figure
                            for US military assistance world-wide to $500 million.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that although the United States could not afford
                            to overlook costs, it must keep firmly in mind its major objectives with
                            respect to such allies as the Turks. He presumed that the State
                            Department shared this view. The Turks were certainly among our best
                            allies and could not be permitted to become disenchanted. The Vice
                            President said that he further assumed that the new committee being set
                            up at the Assistant Secretary level under <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> would take a hard-headed look at the Turkish problem,
                            but that the committee would in the end realize that it must make a deal
                            with the Turks.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> confirmed the
                            Vice President’s conviction that an acceptable deal with Turkey must be
                            arranged. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> wondered
                            whether it was not desirable for the Planning Board to review our
                            present Turkish policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5510/1).
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> replied that
                            for the present, at any rate, our policy was sufficiently broad, but if
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>
                            and other members of the new <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>
                            committee found it desirable for the Council to review the Turkish
                            policy, this should be done.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            wanted to reenforce the statements which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRBJ1">Robertson</persName> had made. The United States
                            simply could not gracefully get out of the commitments for military aid
                            which it had earlier made to friendly countries all over the world.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> expressed
                            thorough agreement with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName>’s statement, and went on to point out that for
                            every dollar of US hardware given to an allied country the United States
                            had to pay another for the support of the soldier who uses the military
                            hardware. He explained that he meant that US economic support had to be
                            given to enable the economies of many of our allied states to support
                            the military establishments which we desired them to maintain. This was
                            more or less true everywhere, and particularly so in the case of
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> said that while this
                            might be so, we should take into consideration the reforms which the
                            Turks must undertake to carry out if our assistance to them was to be
                            meaningful. While of course we wanted the Turks as friends, we wanted
                            them to be permanent and not temporary friends.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that Turkey was but one of
                            a number of countries where we had problems with respect to our military
                            assistance programs. He indicated that the Council would <pb n="657"
                                xml:id="pg_657" facs="0687"/>presently be presented with a review of
                            the whole extent of our military assistance programs world-wide.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> pointed out that,
                            particularly in view of the serious deterioration in the Middle East,
                            this was no time for the United States to have to answer charges of bad
                            faith from our friends.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President expressed agreement with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName>, but also said that he felt
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRR1">Hughes</persName> had made a good
                            point. In short, the United States could not agree to demands upon it
                            which, if fulfilled, would end up by doing the Turks more harm than
                            good. The United States was going to be obliged to make a deal that “we
                            can sell them on.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> pointed out that the difficulty was compounded by
                            the fact that if we try to build up Turkish forces amounting to 20
                            divisions, this move would require US economic assistance which will
                            cost as much again as the figure for the military aid. He could see no
                            solution except an effort to try to reduce the proposed force levels for
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out the
                            difficulty of such a move, in view of the fact that it was the United
                            States itself that had pushed the Turks into accepting the presently
                            agreed military force levels. Moreover, the same thing was true in the
                            case of Korea, Formosa, and Indochina. We would have to have very good
                            reasons indeed to explain why we have changed our minds and have now
                            come to feel that these countries no longer need as large military
                            forces as we had initially urged on them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RNA1">Rockefeller</persName> felt that the best
                            solution might be to cut our military aid program to Turkey and increase
                            our economic assistance.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> opened the briefing
                            by referring to the original statement of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Harold E. Stassen</persName> which had been the
                            basis for the commitment in the Aide-Mémoire of June 4, 1954, handed to
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> on the
                            occasion of the latter’s visit to Washington. <pb n="660"
                                xml:id="pg_660" facs="0690"/>He emphasized the importance of the
                            time factor in programming, and specified that if we completed a program
                            of a certain magnitude in six years instead of five, the country
                            concerned sometimes made a case that the original five year program had
                            not been completed. He continued that in his opinion the United States
                            had, in the Aide-Mémoire referred to above, made a definite commitment
                            in terms of material for one-fourth of the four year program for Turkey
                            involving a buildup of military forces to United States approved <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force goals.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then gave the background of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>’ visit to Washington in June
                            1954. He said that only a month previously, the Prime Minister’s
                            Democrat Party had been swept into power, gaining 508 of 541 seats in
                            the Grand National Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> thus felt that he had a definite mandate from
                            the people (though actually the popular vote was in no way comparable to
                            the overwhelming majority obtained in the <gloss target="#t_GNA1"
                                >GNA</gloss>, the Democrat Party having gained approximately 60% of
                            the popular vote in that election as opposed to approximately 55% in the
                            previous one). <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> had come
                            to Washington with the hope of assistance from the United States to
                            build an economic base in Turkey capable of sustaining the projected
                            Turkish military posture in four years time (without taking account of
                            replacement, spare parts, etc). He estimated that the military (Army)
                            program then envisaged to bring Turkey up to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> force goals called for an $800 million military aid
                            program over a period of four years, with an expenditure of
                            approximately $200 million a year. Further, the Prime Minister was
                            seeking a $300 million economic aid loan, in addition to the economic
                            program then envisaged for Turkey, at the rate of $75 million a
                            year.</p>
                        <p>In Washington, the Prime Minister was told (the Ambassador continued)
                            that there would be no four year commitment, but that the United States
                            military authorities were sympathetic with Turkey’s plans, and were
                            therefore willing to underwrite an immediate commitment for one-fourth
                            of the four year program. In reply to <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName>’ request for economic aid, the United States
                            Government suggested that there be a full, frank discussion of the
                            problems involved, including the exchange rate for the lira, before
                            there could be any consideration of a special accommodation. With some
                            indignation, the Prime Minister said that “under no circumstances” would
                            he discuss the exchange rate. Economic discussions thus ended on a
                            frigid note, though when he left, the Prime Minister did have in his
                            pocket a commitment for one-fourth of the military aid program and over
                            $75 million economic aid for that year. Concurrently, the United States
                            agreed to accelerate delivery of the sum of $500 million in the military
                            aid pipeline.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0691"/>
                        <p>Upon his return to Turkey, the Prime Minister was to undertake a
                            stabilization program and to discuss further the matter of economic aid
                            with the Embassy. However, he passed the summer pleasantly in Istanbul;
                            took no action toward opening negotiations with the United States; took
                            only a few measures toward stabilization; and was confronted with a
                            sharp Turkish business reaction to even those he had taken. At the same
                            time, the attitude of his principal advisor, Acting Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName>, was that Turkey should
                            pump for $300 million in cash for purposes of “maneuver”, and without
                            strings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> interrupted to pose a
                            few questions. Was it the Embassy’s opinion, he asked, that there was an
                            implied willingness on the part of the United States to consider the
                            possibility of making allocations for the last three-fourths of the four
                            year military aid program for Turkey, but no definite commitment to meet
                            three increments? The Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> said yes. Was there a commitment by Turkey, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> pursued, to discuss
                            economic problems with the United States Mission? Again the answer was
                            yes, with the comment that this commitment had not been fulfilled. The
                            Ambassador then noted that there was a close relationship between the
                            economic and military problems in Turkey, but that they were not as
                            close as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName>’s questions
                            implied. In our relations with Turkey, the Ambassador continued, we must
                            assess the importance of the following admitted assets of the country:
                            (1) geography; (2) manpower; (3) psychology. No one could gainsay that
                            Turkey was extremely strategically located; or that her military
                            manpower was superior to that of any other in this area; or that,
                            finally, the Turks have an ingrained anti-Soviet outlook. It was
                            necessary, he added, to make definite decisions on our military program
                            for Turkey, and to make them soon. Military strategy would not wait five
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> said that was all
                            very well, and one must balance advantages and necessities, but he
                            pointed out that many officials in Washington are asking: “What good is
                            a bankrupt ally?”.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador …. said that the Turkish view was: “What we have is
                            yours”, but that concurrently they felt that what the United States has
                            (in the form of credits, matériel, etc.) should be the subject of
                            discussion by the United States with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>There ensued an exchange about the effect of United States relations with
                            Germany upon United States-Turkish relations. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> wanted to know what the
                            attitude of the Turkish Government would be if the United States
                            substantially stepped up its military aid program to Germany. The
                            Ambassador replied that, in general, the Turks have a strong regard for,
                            and a substantial reliance upon, Germany as, a military mentor and
                            provider; and that <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0692"
                            />consequently, anything which increased German military potential was
                            attractive to the Turks, since it would be presumed that part of that
                            potential would be directly advantageous to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then referred briefly to the fact that Turkey had been
                            honored by the visit of some 100 United States Congressmen during the
                            past year, and that the Embassy had been very careful to give these
                            United States officials a very thorough briefing on Turkey. He spoke of
                            the favorable attitude toward Turkey of such congressional leaders as
                            Senator Saltonstall, Senator Green and Congressman Judd.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d334fn2">Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts, Theodore F.
                                Green of Rhode Island, and Walter H. Judd of Minnesota.</note> He
                            noted that out of the entire group there was only one dissonant voice,
                            that of Senator <persName corresp="#p_CHE1">Capehart</persName>, which
                            could be explained by the fact that there are a number of Greek
                            constituents in Indiana, who might be pressured to be emotionally
                            interested in the Istanbul/Izmir riots of last September over
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> noted that in United
                            States thinking, the Middle East was the number one priority in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, and asked about the relationship of
                            a military aid program in Turkey to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The
                            Ambassador pointed out that Turkey was the only country in this area
                            which recognized the State of Israel and which did not observe the Arab
                            economic boycott of that country. On the other hand, he noted that
                            Turkey was doing everything in its power to improve its relations with
                            the Arab States, and he adverted to the Turkish role in the formulation
                            of the United Nations Resolution of 1951,<note n="3" xml:id="d334fn3"
                                >Adopted by the Security Council in September 1951, this resolution
                                affirmed the right of shipping to and from Israel to transit the
                                Suez Canal. For text, see U.N. Doc. S/2322.</note> and in the
                            formulation of the Baghdad Pact. To indicate how carefully Turkey was
                            treading in the delicate field of Arab-Israeli relations, the Ambassador
                            referred to the fact that the Turkish Government did not even allow the
                            Israeli Symphony Orchestra to come to Turkey last year to give a
                            concert, or even to permit individual members of the orchestra to come
                            to Ankara and give performances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> interrupted to say that
                            he thought it was important to keep in mind that from the point of view
                            of Israeli-Arab relations, a stepped-up military aid program for Turkey
                            would not involve the complications that similar program to Iraq would
                            involve, since the latter would presumably have to be balanced by some
                            quid pro quo for Israel.</p>
                        <p>Discussion then ensued concerning recent Soviet overtures to Turkey. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reviewed the Soviet
                            Chargé’s recent conversations with the Deputy Secretary General of the
                            Foreign Office (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EM1">Melih
                            Esenbel</persName>). He noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EM1"
                                >Esenbel</persName> had turned a cold <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663"
                                facs="0693"/>shoulder to these Soviet blandishments. Still, the
                            Soviet approach had been strong, with a concurrent statement by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>, and a warm
                            reception of the new Turkish Ambassador to Moscow. For the first time,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EM1">Esenbel</persName> had expressed concern
                            for the reaction of public opinion in Turkey should the Soviets choose
                            to publicize the definite economic and financial offers which they had
                            made. Continuing the discussion, the Ambassador noted that actually
                            there was a certain amount of Soviet-Turkish trade going on all the
                            time, amounting, among other things, to the transfer across the eastern
                            border of some 100,000 head of cattle a year in exchange for Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> products.…</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> brought up the
                            subject of training Turkish military personnel. He stated that he had
                            learned during his visit to Turkey that there were two problems involved
                            here, (1) the problem of teaching English; (2) the problem of having
                            technicians come back to Turkey and do what they were trained to do. He
                            said that he had heard that all too frequently, for example, trained
                            radar operators were assigned to kitchen police. It was agreed that this
                            was indeed a problem, and that before technicians were brought to the
                            United States for training, they should learn English; and that upon
                            their return to Turkey, it should be understood that they should be
                            indentured to the job for which they were trained.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the question of a relief brigade for Korea, the Ambassador
                            pointed out that this question was a part of the Turkish trading
                            position on the United States military aid program, and that the Turks
                            might take the position that they would agree to ship a new relief
                            brigade to Korea if the United States met certain conditions with
                            respect to military aid.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued to give Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1"
                                >McGuire</persName> the substance of the Embassy’s draft Progress
                            Report on Turkey for the period August 11, 1955–February 11, 1956
                            (Embassy’s Despatch No. 299, January 11, 1956).<note n="4"

                        <p>Following this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName>
                            brought up the specific question of the effect of fulfillment of the
                            projected United States military aid program for Turkey upon the Turkish
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>General Riley<note n="5" xml:id="d334fn5">Deputy Director for Management,
                                    <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>.</note> and Mr.

                                Patterson, Special Assistant to the Director for Economic Affairs,
                                Ankara.</note> replied that, in essence, a stepped-up military
                            program for Turkey, within reasonable limits, would be no serious drain
                            on the adequate Turkish manpower pool. Neither would such a military aid
                            program be a major drain upon the output of the Turkish economy since
                            the Turkish Army’s big <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0694"
                            />requirement was for food and clothing and these would have to be
                            provided for the personnel whether they were in the Army or not. Mr.
                                <persName>Patterson</persName> noted that, at present, Turkey
                            devotes approximately one-third of its central government budget to
                            defense expenditures, and is actually planning to increase such
                            expenditures in the future. It would, of course, be an anti-inflationary
                            move if these funds could be frozen and not spent on defense, but there
                            is no reason to believe that the Turkish Government would collect the
                            present taxes if the proceeds were to be sterilized. He noted,
                            incidentally, that one advantage to the civilian sector of the economy
                            of a military aid program was the fact that many of the recruits were
                            illiterate, and returned from their military service with a capacity to
                            read and write.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> agreed with a statement by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName> that the United
                            States did not want “bankrupt allies”, but stated that he did not
                            believe cutting down United States military aid was a way of bringing
                            Turkey out of bankruptcy—rather quite the contrary. He pointed out that
                            because the Turkish Government was so intent upon fulfilling its
                            military obligations to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> it would
                            probably make a serious attempt to do so whether or not the country were
                            granted military aid, and that consequently lack of United States
                            support for Turkey’s military program would mean that the Government
                            would squeeze its defense financial requirements from other sectors of
                            the economy, to the overall detriment of the Turkish economic situation.
                            On the other hand, as regards to economic aid, Mr.
                                <persName>Patterson</persName> said, it seemed quite clear that
                            United States should hold to a firm policy of extending only the minimum
                            amount of aid necessary to keep Turkey’s head above water unless and
                            until Turkey were to undertake policies of living within her means and
                            so restoring stability and solvency. Otherwise, Turkey could, and would
                            be encouraged to, follow policies which necessitated ever-increasing
                            amounts of foreign help.</p>
                        <p>In this general connection, brief mention was made of the use of economic
                            aid as a foreign policy tool.</p>
                        <p>Following this, Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> gave a briefing on the
                            current Turkish economic situation. He pointed out that from 1949 to
                            1953, the gross national product of Turkey increased at a rapid rate,
                            but that it fell off in 1954 as a result of the drought. The earlier
                            increases of the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> were caused by a
                            fortunate conjunction of several factors: good weather resulting in good
                            crops; the initial material improvements (investments) often had the
                            most spectacular effect and by the consideration that the price of
                            minerals during the period were high and thus increased the value of
                            Turkish exports. United States aid was also an important contributing
                            factor to this increase in the <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>.
                            Possibly even more foreign assistance was <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665"
                                facs="0695"/>obtained from Western Europe and this too had helped
                            increase <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>. The result of all these
                            things was that the Turkish officials became over optimistic and
                            undertook an overambitious investment program. Turkey attempted to do
                            more than it had the resources to pay for. The domestic device used for
                            supporting the rapidly expanded investment program was a tremendous
                            increase in money supply. Since this greatly exceeded the physical
                            resources to match it, Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> continued, the
                            results were (1) a price increase (which had an adverse effect, though
                            an admittedly limited one, on the military program with respect to
                            trainees and to costs); (2) a larger foreign trade gap; and (3) a
                            depreciation in the value of the lira. Soon, Turkey had no reserves; it
                            had a large exchange deficit; it suffered from a shortage of imports—and
                            yet the Turkish Government continued to lay new cornerstones almost
                            every other day, and to undertake a headlong investment program. As a
                            consequence, it finds itself in urgent need of ever increasing economic
                            help from the United States.</p>
                        <p>At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName>’s request, Mr.
                                <persName>Patterson</persName> gave a detailed briefing on the use
                            of counterpart in Turkey. He said that in the past couple of years, it
                            had been used 100% for the military budget but that this year, as an
                            anti-inflationary measure, the United States Government, by the use of
                            its veto power over counterpart, has frozen some 30 million Turkish lira
                            for future unspecified use. In addition, Mr.
                                <persName>Patterson</persName> said, the United States had been
                            parceling out economic aid piecemeal, again as an anti-inflationary
                            measure, since it was hoped this policy would serve to convince the
                            Turks that the United States was serious about the need for economic
                            reforms. They had this year so far advanced only a “first slice” to
                            Turkey, amounting to $12.5 million.</p>
                        <p>In this same connection, mention was also made of the administration of
                            Public Law 480.</p>

                            Riley and Mr. <persName>Patterson</persName> indicated that the Central
                            Bank in Turkey did not perform the classic role of such an institution
                            in other countries, but that rather it was merely an adjunct to the
                            Finance Ministry.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>A discussion concerning loans brought out Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGEP1">McGuire</persName>’s view that in general he
                            considered loans to many undeveloped countries <pb n="666"
                                xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"/>unwise, because it was unrealistic to
                            believe that such countries could actually make interests payments upon
                            them.</p>
                        <p>A discussion then ensued concerning those members of the <persName

                            real Turkish economic reforms. General Riley, Mr.

                                >Kohler</persName>, together with the Ambassador, all agreed that
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Minister
                            of Economy and Commerce, and the Minister of State Enterprises (and
                            probably also the Minister of Defense) were strongly behind a program of
                            realistic reforms in the economic field.</p>

                            undergoing economic privations, both result of mistaken policy by
                            Turkish Government. Leaflets call for changes in Government and
                            particularly removal of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> from office because of his attachment to West
                            and his commitments beyond capacity of country to accomplish with
                            resultant privations now experienced by Turkish people. At same time
                            this campaign going on, which government attempting control largely
                            through its intelligence agencies, Soviets both in Moscow and Ankara are
                            offering Turks as neighbors in need, unlimited economic aid in goods as
                            well as in loans to help them out of their present financial and
                            economic straits. President had before him report of new Ambassador to
                            Moscow, Mr. <persName>Kavur</persName>, in which President of Soviet
                            Union at time Ambassador presented his credentials last week, made
                            offers of economic aid to Turkey, “without any strings attached”. To
                            these Russian overtures, threats and intrigues, President said, “Turkey
                            is well alerted”. This country he told Admiral, is irrevocably committed
                            to West and particularly to United States and has given ample proof
                            whenever opportunity has been presented to demonstrate its loyalty, but
                            he does not minimize danger of subversion particularly with large
                            elements of urban population now living marginal existence as result of
                            scarcities of necessities of life which, however, do not include
                            food.</p>
                        <p>On military side, President said United States has been dragging its feet
                            past two years in giving Turkey equipment necessary enable its defense
                            forces meet their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments.
                            Promises made Prime Minister when he visited United States June 1954 of
                            military equipment not only have not been kept, but no explanation was
                            offered Turks as to why they were not being met. However, added
                            President, as result of recent visit to United States of Acting Chief of
                            Turkish General Staff Tunyjoglu,<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">Presumably
                                a reference to General Tunaboglu.</note> and his conversations with
                            responsible officers of Pentagon, it is believed by Turks that situation
                            now in process of correction and that they can look forward with
                            confidence to continuance of American military support that will enable
                            Turkey to build and maintain its defense establishment up to standard
                            required by its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>In economic field, however, situation now faced by Turkey is critical.
                            Arguments that have been advanced by various American officials who have
                            discussed Turkish economic situation are not, President’s opinion,
                            sound. He cited as instance World Bank which has refused further minor
                            credit to Turks and at same time is party to a four hundred million
                            dollar commitment to build a dam in Egypt. He said that there were other
                            instances of American generosity <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0698"
                            />to countries whose political and military commitments to United States
                            are in no sense comparable to that of Turkey and whose position in no
                            sense is as important at this particular time as that of Turkey in
                            Middle East. He said, as his conviction, the financial needs of Turkey
                            arising out of Turkish determination to build economy able support their
                            defense effort within the lifetime of present government, have not had
                            fair hearings. In his opinion, Turkish needs have been gauged by
                            “bookkeepers and small minded men who have kept from attention of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> true state
                            Turkish needs and Turkey’s importance to United States”. Feels situation
                            is so critical that it is vital President be informed. Then went on to
                            mention that communiqués will be issued simultaneously in United States
                            and Turkey today that <persName corresp="#p_RCB1">Clarence

                        <p>Admiral said President made no specific demands on him in any way of
                            requested action. He has impression that <persName corresp="#p_BC1"

                        <p>Before leaving Washington we had the privilege of being intensively
                            briefed by a wide variety of Departments and agencies that had knowledge
                            of the Turkish problem, and enroute we had the benefit of conferences
                            with the economic staffs of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PGW1"
                                >Perkins</persName> and the Embassy in Paris, as well as with

                                corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName> at Rome. I have the feeling
                            that we were adequately prepared for our task.</p>
                        <p>Our objective was twofold: (1) to present to the officials of the Turkish
                            Government the state of American public opinion with regard to economic
                            aid, and (2) to persuade the Turkish Government to undertake prompt and
                            decisive measures for the solution of their fiscal problems.</p>
                        <p>On this second point, we had an extraordinary break, caused not by
                            anything we did but rather by the fact of our going.</p>
                        <p>While we were in Paris on our way to Turkey, Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> faced up squarely to his
                            financial problems, and announced to his people a program of financial
                            reform containing nearly every element that we had had in mind for
                            presenting to him. He had apparently decided that he should do this on
                            his own, and <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0700"/>not have it
                            thought by his people that he had done it under compulsion from the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The essentials of his program were as follows: <list>

                        <p>In my private conferences with the Prime Minister and the President, I
                            received the most categorical assurances that this reform program would
                            be carried out meticulously, and my associates, in their dealings with
                            the staffs of the various economic ministers, received the impression
                            that everybody in Government meant business on this program. The Prime
                            Minister repeated these assurances to us in front of his Cabinet, and at
                            that time informed us that the following three executive decrees were
                            being issued: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                        <p>It seems to me, therefore, that consideration of the Turkish problem must
                            now be undertaken on the hypothesis that Turkey has, in good faith,
                            taken the initial governmental steps which the United States has long
                            urged it to adopt.</p>
                        <p>More problems remain to be solved, but the beginning thus made is a
                            courageous undertaking by the Prime Minister, and a direct turnabout
                            from the laxity of the last two years.</p>
                        <p>It remains, of course, to be seen whether the Government will follow
                            through on this program, and to that end, if you should so desire, I am
                            prepared, with my colleagues, to return to Turkey early in May to check
                            their progress.</p>
                        <p>I have come to the conclusion, however, in my own mind that the action
                            presently undertaken by the Turkish Government merits a strong
                            reciprocal vote of confidence from the United States, the details of
                            which I shall discuss later.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military Problem</hi></p>
                        <p>My first impression on studying the Turkish problem was that this country
                            was undertaking a military burden beyond its means, and that this should
                            be reduced. The more I studied the problem, however, the more I doubted
                            the soundness of that conclusion.</p>
                        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0701"/>
                        <p>From the strategic point of view, it must be borne in mind that Turkey is
                            of extreme importance to the United States. If we should lose Turkey, we
                            might lose all of the Middle East. Both General <persName
                                corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName> and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAWM1">Fechteler</persName> assured us that in terms of
                            military cooperation, the relationship with Turkey was satisfactory. She
                            has a good army, that is rapidly becoming well equipped.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, her position vis-à-vis the Soviets is taken out of deep
                            conviction, and would not change even though we should abandon aid.
                            Speaking roughly, some 26 percent of her budget expenditure is military
                            in character, which is about 8 percent of her Gross National
                            Product.</p>
                        <p>Since the end of the war the number of men bearing arms has been reduced,
                            and the present army is far more effective than it was, because of
                            increased fire power.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would strongly resist any cutback
                            in Turkey’s force assignment because to do so would take the pressure
                            off other allies who have been far less cooperative than Turkey.</p>
                        <p>This whole military question is moot, however, in my judgment because
                            Turkey would never consent to cut back her forces. They have fought
                            Russia for 300 years, and I think it would be politically impossible to
                            persuade them to reduce their military effort.</p>
                        <p>One thing, however, in the military field needs doing and doing at once.
                            All vagueness as to what the commitment of the United States is to
                            Turkey on the military side should be eliminated. That whole program
                            should be brought into sharp focus, and a new arrangement negotiated, if
                            necessary, in order that hereafter there may be no further
                            misunderstandings on this score. I have discussed this with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon Gray</persName>, and I am prepared to work
                            with him on making our commitment clear.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Immediate Need</hi></p>
                        <p>Short-term the Turkish economy is in desperate straits. For all intents
                            and purposes their entire gold reserve has already been pledged, and
                            they have almost no capacity to finance the most immediate import
                            necessities. Such industry as they have is grinding to a halt for lack
                            of imported raw materials and spare parts, the agricultural industry
                            lacks motor fuel and lubricants for its new equipment, and so forth.
                            There is reason to believe that in a period of perhaps two to three
                            years, the new reform program, coupled with the completion of some of
                            their public ventures that have not yet brought value into the economy,
                            might restore some sort of balance to their trade. But the country may
                            come close to bankruptcy in the next few months. It would do us little
                            good to have an ally that is militarily strong only on paper, if the
                            economy should go <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0702"/>dead. The
                            dangers of the internal unrest that might result are obvious.</p>
                        <p>To relieve this situation, I am altogether opposed to a soft loan.
                            Furthermore, I do not believe the Turkish Government is going to request
                            another loan in the near future.</p>
                        <p>They must have cash and have it now, however, and this would be my
                            recommendation:</p>
                        <p>I propose that our staff in Turkey be forthwith given authority to
                            obligate our Government for sufficient dollar-aid to Turkey to bring
                            that country up for Fiscal 1956 close to the 100 million dollar total of
                            aid which they received in Fiscal 1955. It is my understanding that
                            these funds are available.</p>
                        <p>I propose that the time and manner of making these commitments be left to
                            the discretion of our staff in Turkey. I was impressed with their
                            caliber, and believe they can be trusted so to administer this fund as
                            to bring the greatest possible benefit to the Turkish economy.</p>
                        <p>Time is running out, however, and I urge strongly that they be given this
                            authority and be given it now.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Debt Problems</hi></p>
                        <p>Turkey has a serious problem of short-term debt due to various European
                            nations for capital equipment, and other items, purchased in the course
                            of their too rapid industrial development.</p>
                        <p>These obligations are being handled on a hand-to-mouth basis without
                            orderly planning. Turkey is pursuing a bilateral approach to these
                            questions, trading as best it can with each nation, one at a time. This
                            is costly to the Turkish economy. It forces them to buy in selected
                            markets rather than buying on the best terms wherever available. They
                            are being charged higher prices than competition would justify. I think
                            that the only intelligent approach to that question is the familiar
                            multilateral plan of having all the creditors around one table, and that
                            the agency for accomplishing that would be <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss>. I recognize the apprehension felt by some of the
                            Treasury staff that this would at once bring the United States into the
                            picture, but I believe that that danger can be obviated, and I think
                            that the multilateral solution is the only rational answer. Knowing the
                            Treasury feeling, I did not urge this upon Turkey, but I do feel that I
                            should make my viewpoint clear to you. In my opinion it is the only
                            solution that will give all countries a new and fair start on trading
                            with Turkey. Furthermore, we would thus greatly widen the number of
                            countries that would have a stake in the economic survival of
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>The long-term debt of Turkey is something over 900 millions of dollars.
                            It ought to be refinanced. I would not be prepared to say that this is
                            too much debt for the Turkish economy to bear, but the maturities need
                            to be spread out over a longer period of time.</p>
                        <p>In our talks with the International Monetary Fund, we found that they
                            hold the considered viewpoint that once Turkey embarks upon a monetary
                            reform program, this international debt can be refinanced, possibly by
                            bringing into the situation private banking capital from the United
                            States and other countries. I was so impressed with what Messrs.

                            the Prime Minister and his Cabinet that they seek the early advice of
                            the officials of that Fund with regard to their debt problem. I think
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CHM1">Merle Cochran</persName> should go back
                            to Turkey just as soon as he can, and I believe that under his wise
                            guidance a new and helpful debt program might be worked out for
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Devaluation</hi></p>
                        <p>At no point while I was in Turkey did I let the word “devaluation” pass
                            my lips. This was a studied effort on my part. I came to the conclusion
                            that the logic of events almost inevitably will take Turkey to
                            devaluation, and that it was highly important that this decisive step
                            should be taken by the Turkish Government on its own initiative, and
                            without compulsion from the United States. My slender stock in trade
                            vis-à-vis Turkey is my personal relationship with the Prime Minister. I
                            believe that we understand one another and have mutual respect for each
                            other. I felt that all of that good will might be jeopardized if I let
                            myself be in the position of recommending devaluation to him, because in
                            earlier years he had publicly taken so strongly the position that he
                            would never permit it. My colleagues, in talking with the staffs of the
                            economic ministers, sensed that at the junior levels there is an
                            understanding of the ultimate necessity for devaluation, and I think it
                            would be wiser to let that pressure build up, so that devaluation comes
                            about from inside forces rather than outside pressure.</p>
                        <p>I shall be available at any time to any of the interested agencies for
                            further discussion of the Turkish problem, and of course to you for any
                            further counsel that you may think I can give.</p>

                        <p>1468. There are disturbing indications that, despite <persName

                            officials of scope of his mission, Turkish Government still has
                            lingering hope that his report and recommendations to US Government may
                            result in some spectacular US gesture. Impression gained that Turks
                            might expect US to produce solution their problems without their
                            pursuing path of gradual but sound economic stabilization. <persName

                            ones they are of magnitude which, in his and our opinion, can largely be

                            which it already publicly committed. In addition would seem wise for

                            endeavored today to review the Turkish problem.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this letter is to submit some specific
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>In the morning we had an exploratory conference with the new

                        <p>This afternoon we met with <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OAN1">Overby</persName>,

                                corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, and various staff members.</p>
                        <p>The situation is mixed in Turkey and not too satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>On the financial stability program, the line established by the Prime
                            Minister in January has been reasonably well held, but no new steps have
                            been taken. Doubt is cast upon its vitality by the resignations of Ulas
                            and Kurdash, who had been known proponents.</p>
                        <p>The immediate and most urgent crisis has to do with the importation of
                            petroleum products, commonly called <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>.
                            The Turks have exhausted every known means of financing those imports
                                <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0706"/>beyond the end of May, and
                            without them their economy will certainly come to a full halt.</p>
                        <p>It is the position of the Turkish Government that the amount of aid
                            granted pursuant to our mission to Turkey is inadequate to meet the
                            public relations problem. People in Turkey still expect a $300 million
                            loan, and the Prime Minister fears that his Cabinet will fall due to his
                            failure to secure that sum of money. For this reason he has not yet
                            announced the total of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 aid.</p>
                        <p>The International Monetary Fund is now sending a working party to Ankara
                            in advance of its normal June date. Sturc, who leads that party, will
                            arrive in Ankara on April 23, to be followed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CHM1">Merle Cochran</persName> on May 10. It is hoped
                            that out of that mission may come discussions of the exchange problem,
                            but in the opinion of our country team the Turks will not voluntarily
                            open that subject.</p>
                        <p>Out of our discussions today, there seemed to me to be consensus to
                            support the following specific recommendations, which I now submit: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The American people and the Turkish people must be told
                                    promptly the full amount of American aid for <gloss
                                        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956. The Turkish Government
                                    should be given a further opportunity to make that announcement
                                    itself, but if they fail to do so, we should release the facts
                                    to the press in both countries. This will serve as a partial
                                    check on the obvious belief held by many Turks that our dollar
                                    aid allotment is not yet final, and will negative [<hi

                                    of the government have promoted that what we have done is
                                    niggardly and unworthy of the relationship with a staunch
                                    ally.</item>

                                <item>$13 million out of the recent allotments should be made
                                    available to our country team for financing about three months
                                    of <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>. We all recognize the
                                    difficulty that this creates for <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                        >ICA</gloss>, but we see no escape from the dilemma. We
                                    cannot let all Turkish industry be shut down for lack of fuel
                                    and lubricants, and there is no other source from which the
                                    money can come.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>This allocation should be used, however, by the country team
                                    for the express purpose of persuading the Turks that they
                                    themselves must open with <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                                    the subject of the improvement of the exchange situation. We
                                    believe this can be done without making it as bald as a
                                    categorical demand for devaluation. We see no way, however,
                                    other than by the use of these funds, to insure that <gloss
                                        target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> will have the subject before
                                    it, and if this present working party should leave Turkey
                                    without discussing that subject, it might set the whole matter
                                    back for a long period of time.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>When these steps are taken, we should stand absolutely firm,
                                    and grant no other aid whatever to Turkey until discussions for
                                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957 open. The fact that
                                    we are standing firm, and that these decisions are in fact
                                    final, should be made clear to the Turks by every means at our
                                    command.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Upon my return from the other mission, it had been tentatively agreed
                            that I would go back to Ankara with my associates the first <pb n="677"
                                xml:id="pg_677" facs="0707"/>week in May. This was for the purpose
                            of checking the progress of the stabilization program.</p>
                        <p>After discussing it at length with all concerned, I have come to the
                            conclusion that it would be inappropriate and perhaps dangerous for us
                            to go that soon. For us to arrive there while the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> study is on might take the whole
                            pressure off. It would once more suggest to the Turks that some miracle
                            might still happen.</p>
                        <p>I do think, however, that we should go back later.</p>
                        <p>I am not available in the month of June, but I shall be prepared to go at
                            any time after the first week in July, and my associates will be
                            prepared to go with me.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I will continue to follow the subject.</p>

                            Learn through military channels plans for massive deployment US air and
                            ground forces and special weapons in Turkey, mainly Adana area. Also
                            that parallel instructions coming my way to get Turk consent.</p>
                        <p>This would be tough one to give Turks cold. They have been trying for two
                            years now to get US to consult them on the Arab-Israeli conflict and
                            related aspects our Middle East policy, with relatively little to show
                            for their pains. They will probably cooperate in these plans as
                            partners, but are likely to be sticky if we simply put it to them
                            unilaterally. In view of Moscow’s warning against interference some time
                            ago, Turkish cooperation in a military venture of this magnitude
                            involves some major risks for them, from the other side of their
                            northern borders. Finally, would be well remember our military and

                        <p>When Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> had concluded his briefing, the
                            President inquired whether the studies of the various nations by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee were being
                            pursued as a matter of priority. Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName>
                            replied that the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                            Committee report on Turkey had been completed and was only awaiting
                            approval by the responsible department <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681"
                                facs="0711"/>heads before being circulated. Studies of the other
                            nations would follow. The President asked whether Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> meant to suggest that we should needle
                            certain department heads in order to get the report on Turkey out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> stated
                            emphatically that the whole question of our military assistance programs
                            was now in need of a most careful and thorough review. Whatever the
                            nature of the changes going on in the USSR, we could at least safely
                            conclude that these changes require us to do more by way of building
                            economic strength around the periphery of the Soviet Union, rather than
                            to continue our present scale of effort to build military strength
                            around this periphery. The older policy which we have continued to
                            pursue was obviously justifiable when it was undertaken some five years
                            ago in the light of Soviet aggressive moves against Greece, Iran,
                            Turkey, Yugoslavia, and elsewhere. Now, however, the time has come to
                            reverse this policy. The military assistance programs which we are now
                            envisaging will enormously strain the economies of such nations as
                            Turkey. We will be confronted with two disagreeable alternatives. Either
                            we will ourselves have to “pick up the tab”, perhaps to the tune of $400
                            million a year, in support of Turkey; or else we shall have to severely
                            cut down the size of Turkey’s military establishment.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that it was to resolve such problems as these
                            that we had created the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                            Committee. It was, nevertheless, a very great problem to him to
                            determine how we could ever induce the Turks to agree to a considerably
                            reduced military establishment. On the last occasion of a trip to Turkey
                            it had become clear to the President that they wanted six more divisions
                            than the nineteen which they already had and were finding it difficult
                            to support.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he
                            understood the point of view of the Secretary of State, and that in
                            principle he favored it. In his opinion, it was no more than sound
                            military principle to secure first your military headquarters and
                            thereafter to proceed to secure your military outposts. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he was
                            beginning to have very great anxiety about military headquarters, by
                            which term he said he meant the domestic economy of the United States.
                            He expressed himself as very worried about the possibility of a
                            recession, and added that a strong US economy was a fundamental bulwark
                            of the free world.</p>
                        <p>The President again said that he had wished the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee to analyze in the
                            case of a half dozen other countries, this problem which was represented
                            by Turkey. In response to the President, Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> read the schedule of the dates on
                            which the <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0712"/>working group’s
                            reports to the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee
                            were estimated to be completed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                            was now time for the Council to get down to brass tacks on the problem
                            of Turkey. He said that Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RCB1">Randall</persName>, and himself had been spending
                            an awful lot of time in recent months on Turkey. Moreover, at this
                            precise time former Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CHM1"
                                >Cochran</persName>, now of the International Monetary Fund, was in
                            Turkey making a thorough review of Turkey’s economic and financial
                            situation. He was expected to report his findings within a few
                                days,<note n="5" xml:id="d341fn5">In a June 19 memorandum to

                                    corresp="#p_KTV1">Kalijarvi</persName> referred to a brief
                                report on <persName corresp="#p_CHM1">Cochran</persName>’s mission
                                to Turkey, which, although not found, had been attached to the
                                memorandum. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> Central Files,

                                Situation for January–March.</note> and it was hoped that through
                            the auspices of the International Monetary Fund the Turks could be
                            induced to carry out some of the economic reforms which were badly
                            needed and which we were strongly recommending.</p>
                        <p>As to cutting back on the size of the Turkish military establishment,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed that
                            this would be extremely difficult. Accordingly, we were going at this
                            objective in an indirect fashion. Turkey, moreover, was on the brink of
                            economic disaster. Twice in recent weeks, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> had had to bail out the Turks
                            at the last minute in order to keep them in oil and spare parts. At any
                            rate, it was clear that there was no need to needle anyone on the
                            problem of Turkey. In point of fact, until Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CHM1">Cochran</persName> had made his report we simply
                            could not decide what to do about the Turkish problem. Finally, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, he wanted to
                            point out that it was the Turks who were so anxious to build up a larger
                            military establishment. It is not we who are pressing them on this
                            matter. It is they who are pressing us, and we were being presented with
                            a terrible problem in devising ways and means of inducing them to reduce
                            their military forces.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that of course he knew this. Everyone today is
                            clamoring for armament.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether
                            the President would like to hear from Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> on this matter. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> said that he actually
                            had in hand the text of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName> Committee report on Turkey, although it had not
                            been finally approved. It emphasized two problems. The first problem was
                            the cost to the United States of our program of economic assistance to
                            Turkey. The second problem was the cost of our military assistance
                            program both to the Turks and to ourselves. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> report estimated that for the
                            years 1955 to 1960, if we give the Turks what they are <pb n="683"
                                xml:id="pg_683" facs="0713"/>asking for, the sums would run into the
                            billions. Part of these costs would fall on us; part would fall on the
                            Turkish economy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> concluded with a brief comment on the procedures
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee accepts
                            from our military people the force goals for Turkey which they
                            recommend. On this basis the Committee proceeds to figure up what it
                            would cost the Turks and what it would cost the United States to
                            maintain such force levels in Turkey. Incidentally, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> added, the economic data
                            required by the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                            Committee for its study of Turkey had been handed in a long time ago. It
                            was only recently that the Pentagon had supplied the requisite military
                            data.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was under the impression that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee had been assigned
                            the task of determining the size and character of military forces which
                            the Turkish economy was in a position to sustain. Mr.
                                <persName>Anderson</persName> then read to the President the terms
                            of reference of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                            Committee, and noted that the primary job of the Committee was fact
                            finding. In the light of these facts, it was the responsibility of the
                            Planning Board to review the policy of the United States toward Turkey
                            and the other countries which were under study by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that the Council was now talking in terms of a
                            program for Turkey which would cost $2 billion over the next five years.
                            It was not to be forgotten that Turkey was only one of many claimants on
                            the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> said with emphasis that this was precisely the
                            situation, and that this country simply could not afford to supply
                            military assistance in such vast amounts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> made the
                            observation that one of the most frightening aspects of the Soviet Union
                            was the undoubted capacity of its leaders to make significant decisions
                            so quickly. He asked the Council to think what the Soviets had done by
                            way of decisions over the last year, in the fields of both internal and
                            external policy. The Soviet Union had demonstrated a capacity for prompt
                            decisionmaking that no democracy could probably ever equal.
                            Nevertheless, in the face of this Soviet capability our Government
                            needed to do everything it possibly could to improve its own capacity to
                            make prompt decisions. Things get studied to death in this Government,
                            to a point where we are unable to reach a decision until the decision is
                            too late to be really useful. If we could get the heads of the
                            responsible departments and agencies here together around this table, we
                            could make decisions in a period of 24 hours on the issues that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee has been
                            studying at such length. Such decisions would undoubtedly not be so
                            perfect as if they had been studied at great length; but what the
                            decisions lacked in perfection they would more than make up for in
                            timeliness. In any <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0714"/>case, we
                            must reach decisions like these in a much shorter time span. We must
                            either compel officials below us in our departments to move more
                            rapidly, or else we, as heads of departments, must make the decisions
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he agreed
                            with all that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            had stated, but felt compelled to point out that many of our decisions
                            must be made on the basis of factors we cannot actually control. Turkey,
                            for example, was on the verge of a bust-up.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he frankly doubted whether wise policy decisions
                            could be made by simply getting together a few heads of departments and
                            without full knowledge of the facts relating to the problem to be
                            decided. He agreed, however, that we were probably in a position now to
                            make a decision on the case of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> pointed out
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee
                            report on Turkey had not yet officially been circulated. Only Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHCJ1">Hoover</persName> knew precisely its
                            content. Despite this, however, we have long known the essential
                            elements in the Turkish situation. The gist of the problem was how to
                            revise Turkey’s military program to a point where we and the Turks
                            together could find resources to support the military program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Anderson</persName> pointed out that the Planning Board
                            would promptly review the relevant country policies as soon as it
                            received the reports of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName> Committee.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that,
                            as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> had pointed
                            out, we already know the broad answer to the Turkish problem. No one,
                            however, has received any authority yet to recommend what we should do
                            in response to the Turkish problem.</p>
                        <p>(At this point in the discussion of Turkey, the Council launched into a
                            discussion of broader aspects of US military and economic assistance
                            programs, for which discussion see Item 6.)<note n="6" xml:id="d341fn6"
                                >Item 6 was a “Review of Military Assistance and Supporting
                                Programs”.</note></p>
                        <p>Subsequently, getting back to the problem of Turkey, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> asked whether the National
                            Security Council should request the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName> Committee to indicate in their forthcoming
                            report on Turkey a military program of a size and character which the
                            Turks could support with an acceptable degree of assistance from the
                            United States. In response, the President said he wanted the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee to make such a
                            suggestion, and indeed believed that this request was already included
                            in the terms of reference of the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1"
                                >Prochnow</persName> Committee. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> warned of the difficulties inherent in the
                            attempt to provide the study requested by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> agreed that whatever the
                            results of these studies, we would have to provide some financial
                            assistance to <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0715"/>Turkey for a very
                            long period of time. Agreeing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said that we had better start out by figuring out
                            just how much money we are willing to provide by way of assistance to
                            Turkey. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said
                            it seemed to him that we had to start with the military side and the
                            military decision, and then work back to the economic and financial
                            decision.</p>

                            eventuality, drop the matter. But Turkey’s importance to the United
                            States and the West is such that her failure to accept the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> proposals only augments our danger and
                            increases our responsibility to find some way to keep her a valuable
                            ally. She cannot be such if her economic situation “goes to pot”. It is
                            lacking foresight to say she must go along with us whether or not we do
                            anything. In this world in which we live today all the rules are being
                            broken. I am sure Turkey would be forced to break a few before she
                            collapsed economically. We must not let her go down.<note n="4"

                                <p>“There seems to be general agreement among the economists as to
                                    the things to be done. We hope the Turkish Government will do
                                    them. However, if it does not, and if its difficulties are
                                    intensified, we will not turn a cold shoulder. We still count
                                    Turkey a friend and ally. While in recent years Congress has
                                    reduced appropriations for foreign aid the amounts of economic
                                    aid extended to Turkey have been increased. Although Turkey has
                                    not received the large loan which the Turkish Government
                                    requested, the aid extended has been and is substantial and can
                                    be expected to dull the edge of Turkish economic difficulties.
                                    It is doing this at the present time, witness <gloss

                                    and other current requirements. I hope that the provision of
                                    this aid by the United States does not foster in the Turkish
                                    Government an unwillingness to take corrective measures. This
                                    coming week may see decisions taken that may mean much in
                                    setting up conditions under which Turkey can overcome some of
                                    her baffling difficulties. Whether this happens or not, you can
                                    rest assured of our friendly attitude toward Turkey and of our
                                    sympathetic understanding of the difficulties with which you are
                                    surrounded.“ (Department of State, Central Files, 782.5–<gloss

                        <p>On August 21, during a discussion at the Secretary’s Staff meeting, the
                            subject of economic aid to Turkey was raised. According to the notes of

                                    economic aid. The Turks reportedly were counting on help from

                                    had been done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                                    replied there had been no specific recommendations, with the

                            all of their people are pressing hard to know what their total
                            assistance will be in the current fiscal year. Of course, it is not
                            unreasonable to say that they need to know this for their planning.</p>
                        <p>We face again the old dilemma. On the one hand, Turkey is important to
                            us, both from the military and the political point of view, having
                            recently given such staunch assistance in the Suez crisis; on the other,
                            she still refuses to face her exchange problem. Internally, she is
                            sticking pretty well to the fiscal reforms promised to me when I was
                            there last February. Externally, she continues to duck the
                            recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We concluded that we had no alternative than to give Turkey assurances at
                            this time that her economic aid would equal that of last year. She has
                            already had $25 million, which was the advance on devaluation that did
                            not come off. This, therefore, means a present assurance of $55 million
                            more.</p>
                        <p>We will have another meeting shortly to discuss the <gloss

                            admitted that he had no confirmed information regarding overflights but
                            said that he is convinced that the Soviets are now operating into Syria,
                            either across Turkey or Iran. He said that, in view of the seriousness
                            of the situation, there is great need for the U.S. to find out what is
                            actually going on there. Turkish radar equipment is entirely inadequate,
                            and there is now no capability in the area to intercept the type of
                            Soviet aircraft which would be involved in an overflight. As emphasized
                            in a previous conversation, the Admiral and the JCS would like to make
                            arrangements to put U.S. Air Force interceptors into the Adana Base.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that it really
                            comes down to a question of judgment as to whether we should approach
                            the Turks at this time on the question of undertaking additional <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> operations in Turkey. After taking
                            all the factors into consideration, the Department does not believe that
                            such action would be desirable at the present time. It is a question of
                            judgment, and the Department’s judgment is against doing it now.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> went on to point
                            out that the Turks themselves have handed over to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> responsibility for the air defense of
                            Turkey. Under existing arrangements the Turkish general staff
                            theoretically could not send Turkish planes up to intercept hostile
                            aircraft; orders would have to come from the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> commander in the area, who happens to be an American.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wolf</persName> expressed the <pb
                                n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0724"/>belief that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council would be greatly concerned
                            over the prospect of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> assuming
                            responsibility for the territorial defense of individual member states
                            to the exclusion of national responsibility and authority. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> responded that
                            without such a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> system we could not
                            expect to have effective air defense in Turkey or in a number of other
                            places.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that he found it
                            hard to understand why other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, such as Norway, Belgium or Portugal, would object to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> taking over the command
                            function if, as in the present case with Turkey, a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> member had requested the organization
                            to do it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJJ1">Wolf</persName> pointed out
                            that the concern on the part of other nations is based on their fear of
                            triggering action which might be based on some local situation rather
                            than on a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-wide issue. He suggested
                            that the best way to handle the matter, if we believe it necessary to
                            put extra equipment into Turkey, would be to have <gloss
                                target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> come forward with a requirements
                            study and then make arrangements with Turkey on the basis of that
                            study.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> reiterated that
                            the Turks have shown themselves entirely inadequate in radar operations.
                            They have some F–84 aircraft which are not suitable for intercepting
                            late-model Soviet equipment. Radar with higher and wider coverage, as
                            well as up-to-date interceptor aircraft, is needed if there is to be an
                            adequate defense for Turkey and other areas in the Middle East. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> called attention to the
                            fact that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> wants
                            a Presidential decision on the matter of the introduction of additional
                            equipment into Turkey, irrespective of State and Defense positions on
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of Turkish concern over reported overflights it was
                            agreed that State and Defense do not accept the Turkish point of view
                            that overflights in themselves call into play Article 5 of <gloss

                                considered an attack against them all.”</note> Mr. <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>, asserted that
                            overflights of the U.S. would not in themselves be considered to
                            constitute a casus belli. We would handle the matter on the basis of a

                                Ambassador in Turkey, who is an old friend of his. He <pb n="698"
                                    xml:id="pg_698" facs="0728"/>stated that he was going to Izmir
                                tomorrow and that he will spend some time next week in Istanbul. He
                                stated that he had heard of the fine state of cooperation between
                                the two nations that had been reached. He stated that he had always
                                told the same thing to other visitors. The <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss> stated that he would like to have this cooperation
                                continued. He further stated that recent developments in the Middle
                                East were of great importance to the Turkish government and the
                                Turkish Armed Forces. The Turks are following very carefully the
                                developments in this area and of course are taking the necessary
                                measures to meet any kind of development. The <gloss

                                    <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, it would not be appropriate
                                for him to talk about the proper use of American Aid delivered to
                                Turkey but he is confident that Turkish and American representatives
                                in Turkey have talked to him in detail about this subject.</item>

                            <item>Meanwhile, said the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, he would
                                like to mention the recent developments, especially in the southern
                                neighboring countries—Syria. The Russians have been trying recently
                                to develop certain strong-holds in Syria and in this way to create a
                                dangerous threat against Turkey. The Turks could not guess right now
                                what this situation might take in the future. He would like to say
                                that we do not believe the developments there are for the benefit of
                                Turkey as the Russians have been actually flying over Turkish
                                territory carrying troops to this country. Then there are the
                                Russian Troop movements in Bulgaria—especially the Armored Units.
                                These actions do not give the Turks confidence that this is for the
                                benefit of Turkey. Again, said the <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss>, the equipment and armament that were taken from
                                the French and British in Egypt have shown that the Russians have
                                been working for along time and shows plainly by their efforts in
                                Europe that if no serious step is taken (by the Turks) this could
                                develop into something more serious. Again, said the <gloss
                                    target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, the serious developments in
                                Hungary where the Russians are ruthlessly smashing the Hungarian
                                people who do not possess any arms or weapons; and again the fever
                                of hate-the-free world is looking at them while the Russians are
                                strangling them, is against humanity. These events make the Turks
                                think very seriously—may lead to a world war.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that recent events
                                show that in case of attack or aggression the nations will have to
                                struggle with their own assistance and own forces until assistance
                                and aid can come. The recent developments and the efforts of the
                                Russians have shown us that we should study a little more carefully
                                our defense installations like the radar installations. It is shown
                                that Russian planes flying over Turkey at 50,000 feet are secure as
                                Turk radars cannot detect them. The Turks do not possess this
                                capability. Again, unfortunately, the present aircraft with the
                                Turkish Air Force are not capable to <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699"
                                    facs="0729"/>cope with planes flying at such high altitudes.
                                Therefore it is necessary to greatly augment the radar equipment. It
                                would materially increase the coverage if they could install
                                effective radars on the Black Sea to give early warning. Gen. Dewey
                                stated that the Turkish Air Force had come to an agreement with
                                    <gloss target="#t_JAMMAT1">JAMMAT</gloss> just recently on a
                                plan which would accomplish what the <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss> desired. Gen. Dewey stated that he recognized that
                                the present best Turkish radar had little effectiveness over 45,000
                                ft. He further stated that he was trying to get converters for the
                                present light weight radars on the Black Sea as their lack was now
                                constituting a void. Gen. Dewey stated that he was aware that the
                                Turks would like the high performance radar which would have a
                                detection capability up to 75,000 ft.</item>

                                    target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> equipment. Recent developments have
                                shown that they should discuss this matter whenever they can. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_AA1">AA</gloss> equipment is of concern and
                                the motors, signal and communications equipment which are in their

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that while he is
                                speaking about the shortages he would like to emphasize and mention
                                that they are not disappointed with the situation and with the
                                Russians because if we study history we will see that this nation
                                has fought against the Russians and that no time have the Russians
                                been successful against the Turks and they will not be until such
                                time as there will not be a single Turkish man. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that if we study the
                                Communism concept of activities throughout the world we will see
                                that this philosophy is attractive to the poor and the laboring
                                classes who think that some day they will be prosperous and happy
                                under it. It is not this way. Why, asked the <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss>, does not Communism find a good place in Turkey?
                                The reason is because this concept and idea comes from Russia, a
                                country for which the Turks have always had a hatred and which at no
                                time will this country accept Communism unless it comes from another
                                country.</item>

                                movements on the Bulgarian boundary and in northern Thrace and
                                assumed that this segment had been under study from the internal
                                security point of view and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but
                                that he would like to ask about recent events in Syria where <pb

                                into Syria. Would this create the possibility of a new front and a
                                new line, and in this case would this lead to more of an activation
                                of the Baghdad pact and this mean that this would require equipment
                                other than that under <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that the information
                                the Turks get from Syria about the troop movements and other
                                activities are not firm but there is this point of view about their
                                intentions: one cannot help but think that the Russians are
                                contemplating a long range plan— maybe they will not do anything;
                                they may join Egypt, and may encircle Turkey from the East, West and
                                the South, so that in case of war they would be in a good position
                                to fight against Turkey. They would be able to execute a pincers
                                movement through Thrace and Syria. As long as the Turks are strong
                                and can hold the Turkish Straits the Turks do not think that the
                                Soviets can accomplish anything this way. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> thinks that the main Soviet
                                intention is to descend into the Mediterranean and conduct action
                                against allied lines of communication. The present action on the
                                part of the Soviets will create a Southern border and require
                                consideration by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName> stated that in a
                                recent press release by a high Turkish official, on the way to the
                                meeting in Pakistan, he stated that Arab countries might see the
                                benefit Turkey had received from the Baghdad Pact and might also
                                decide to join. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName>
                                asked if, in the opinion of the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>,
                                there was any hope that other Arab countries might desire to join
                                the Baghdad Pact. The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> replied
                                that the official who made the statement had been in the capacity of
                                Foreign Minister and that he had tried to express his personal
                                opinion to show that other countries who had joined the Baghdad Pact
                                had been aided to a better position against the common enemy. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName> stated that if
                                Arab countries could have a feeling that being a member of the
                                Baghdad Pact would help them to resist Soviet aims of submerging
                                Arab countries, then they might have more of a feeling to join the
                                Baghdad Pact.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that he would like
                                to comment and present his views on the Southern Border of Turkey,
                                and to state why consideration must be given to this point. He
                                stated that there are many solutions that could be given: first of
                                all, the Turks could bring some forces from the Eastern Front around
                                Erzurum to the south to compose units or activate new mobile units
                                on this front. He felt however to do this would be a great mistake
                                because it would cause a reduction of the Eastern Front against the
                                Russians— the Russians possess 22 divisions in the Caucasus which
                                could be used against the Eastern Front and it is the Soviet
                                intention to create a suggestion and strong feeling and crisis to
                                cause the Turks to shift and reduce their main effort on the Eastern
                                Front—therefore they do not want to move any troops from the Eastern
                                Front. Therefore the <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0731"/>Turks
                                recognize the necessity for mobile units to protect their Southern
                                Front. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName> inquired as
                                to what else would be required other than ground troops and was told
                                that the Minister referred to Motorized units.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> stated that he thought
                                there was another important problem which Gen. Dewey knows about
                                which had developed a couple of days ago when Russian planes were
                                trying to overfly Turkey. This was brought to the attention of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> council and they are still
                                discussing the matter and trying to see if this overflight would
                                constitute a violation against Turkey for an attack. Gen. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GGAM1">Gruenther</persName> thinks that this would
                                be a direct attack against Turkey and should be acted against by
                                Turkish Air Forces, but he stated Gen. Norstadt has said this is
                                just an overflight of Turkey and should not be considered as an
                                attack. This is contradictory, the <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss> thinks that they are just trying to hold Turkey so
                                that it would not act and create a difficult situation as a member
                                of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName> stated that he hoped so—he
                                stated that he appreciates what he has heard today; he stated that
                                he had re-read the tribute Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                    >MacArthur</persName> had paid to Turkish Armed Forces when he
                                said that never had he seen finer fighting men. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ANJ1">Armour</persName> stated that this summarizes
                                what he has heard while here and from other sources; and would like
                                to leave this as a parting note. The <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                    >MOD</gloss> stated in closing that the Turks are facing the
                                situation calmly; that they do not intend to sit idly by and watch a
                                bad situation develop, but whatever they do they will act in
                                coordination with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and

                                the Turks are more concerned than the circumstances warrant. It is
                                clear that, associated with their pessimistic view of developments,
                                is a Turkish feeling that there should be a fuller exchange of views
                                on our respective estimates of the situation. To meet that problem
                                we believe arrangements should be made for a weekly or bi-weekly

                            <item>Turkish concern over Syria is in the context of Russian
                                penetration there. We feel that their note is an invitation to the
                                discussion of positive measures toward effecting a change of
                                government in Syria. The Syrian situation is being urgently
                                evaluated here and, based on this evaluation, we plan to convey
                                soonest to the Turks appropriate information thereon. The question
                                of alterations in the government of Syria and the desirability of
                                consulting with the Turks on this matter, are also matters calling
                                for urgent consideration. It should be noted that there is some
                                basis to fear that the main purpose of the Turkish memorandum might
                                be to put the United States on notice that the Turks are considering
                                action in Syria, and thus minimize criticism on our part if they
                                should proceed.</item>

                            <item>The present Turkish concern is prompted in part by their belief
                                that there are now numerous Russian overflights of Turkey.… There is
                                a clear need for better aircraft detection facilities in Turkey and
                                it is recommended as a minimum that current radar construction
                                programs there under <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> be
                                accelerated. This is being taken up with Defense.</item>

                            <item>The question of aircraft support has been raised informally by the
                                Turks on several occasions during the last two weeks but they have
                                not yet specifically addressed such a request to the United States.
                                We have told the Turks that the matter of “American aircraft for
                                Turkey” is under study. In view of the possibility of such a formal
                                request being received soon, we believe that this general problem of
                                detection and interception capability in Turkey should be given very
                                high priority by the JCS.</item>

                            <item>Turkey traditionally has sought to deal with the United States
                                bilaterally on any questions where multilateral organizations are
                                involved. To resort to bilateral arrangements of this sort out of
                                the context of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would invite

                                similar bilateral arrangements. The Turks appear to feel rebuffed

                                interpret overflights of Turkey as a basis for invoking Article 5 of

                                        memorandum we had received from the Turks, which he had
                                        seen. I said we were actively studying what we could do to
                                        meet the Turkish apprehensions, and said that specifically
                                        we were tentatively thinking about having weekly or
                                        bi-weekly intelligence exchanges with the Turks in Ankara;
                                        we were thinking about strengthening their radar screen;
                                        that while we did not believe it desirable to join the
                                        Baghdad Pact, we were thinking about some kind of a
                                        declaration which would be helpful not only with the Turks
                                        but with the Iranians, Iraqis, and Pakistanis; and finally,
                                        that we had asked the Department of Defense to study the
                                        question of whether additional US interceptor aircraft might
                                        be made available to the Turks. I made clear that our study
                                        was still in the preliminary stage but we had the problem
                                        under active consideration.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                            deliver following memorandum to Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> at earliest opportunity.</p>
                        <p>“The Turkish Memorandum of November 14 has been given most careful study
                            by the United States Government. The United States fully appreciates the
                            potential dangers to which the Turkish Government has referred, and
                            wishes to assure its Turkish allies once more of the steadfastness of
                            its friendship and of its earnest desire to consult regularly on such
                            matters of mutual interest and concern.</p>
                        <p>The United States is glad to note that the Turkish Government in its
                            memorandum has posed its grave questions in the light of the long
                            standing Turkish-American relationship and the common problems of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance. The plans that are
                            to be made and the <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0735"/>action that
                            is to be taken should of course be fully consonant with the interests,
                            plans and actions of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The United States agrees with the Turkish view regarding the potential
                            dangers of a Soviet policy of encirclement and isolation. Already the
                            American Ambassador in Ankara has transmitted to the Turkish Government
                            an estimate of the particular dangers in Syria. The United States would
                            like to maintain hereafter an exchange of information and views on this
                            subject, both bilaterally and in the North Atlantic Council. It is noted
                            that the Turkish memorandum refers in some detail to the situation in
                            Syria. The United States would be interested in learning more precisely
                            what the Turkish Government might have in mind.</p>
                        <p>It has also been noted that various reports of actual Soviet penetration
                            into Syria in the form of military personnel and quantities of Soviet
                            military equipment, particularly aircraft, have considerably exaggerated
                            the actual situation as we understand it to be. Discounting these
                            exaggerated reports, there nevertheless remains a situation which is the
                            cause of serious concern, the main factor at present being the apparent
                            influence of military elements in Syria who seem to be favorably
                            disposed toward the Soviet Union, and the tendency of the Syrians to
                            look to the Soviet Government for support.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the Soviet Union has capitalized upon the Egyptian
                            situation to increase the fears of the Syrians that hostile forces are
                            threatening them, and to claim that the Soviets are their primary source
                            of security. This presents a situation which is difficult to cope with,
                            but it is our estimate that it will be far easier to deal with it as
                            there is a withdrawal of foreign forces from Egypt and an increase of
                            confidence that hostilities will not recur. In these circumstances the
                            atmosphere for a change in the trends in Syria might be more
                            propitious.</p>
                        <p>The dangers that face Iran are likewise clear to the United States
                            Government. The United States has, in its communiqué of November 29,
                                1956,<note n="3" xml:id="d352fn3">For text of the U.S. statement,

                                918.</note> already made clear its stout support of the Baghdad Pact
                            and the grave view the United States would take of a threat to the
                            territorial integrity and political independence of the members of the
                            Pact. Moreover, it should be clear to all that if Iran again becomes the
                            object of aggressive Soviet designs as it was in 1946 the United States
                            will, as it did then, lend its influence and full support to United
                            Nations action to check aggression. The determination of this Government
                            to cooperate fully with the United Nations in such matters has been so
                            amply demonstrated in Korea that it does not require further
                            elucidation. We are, of course, continuing substantial economic and <pb
                                n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0736"/>military aid to Iran and shall
                            demonstrate in all feasible ways our interest in the welfare and
                            security of that country.</p>
                        <p>In dealing thus with the problems of the flanks of Turkey, the United
                            States does not underestimate the central problem of the defense of
                            Turkey itself. Appreciating the need for more effective air defense
                            measures, the United States is prepared to explore ways to contribute to
                            the solution of this problem.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the ‘coordination of cooperation’ in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, the United States Government reiterates to the
                            Turkish Government its resolution to join its allies in taking the
                            action called for under the North Atlantic Treaty against armed attack
                            on Turkey. Agreed <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> procedures, in
                            our view, cover the measures for coordinating action under the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>In setting forth these views and intentions, the United States Government
                            wishes to express once more its appreciation for the frankness and
                            spirit of confidence which have marked the Turkish Government’s
                            Memorandum and to assure the Turkish Government of its willingness to
                            undertake further consultations upon these problems of serious mutual
                                interest.”<note n="4" xml:id="d352fn4"><p>On December 18, in

                        <p>In the course of his briefing of the Council on the reference report
                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5708), Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> summarized much of the paper,
                            read the sections containing the Planning Board recommendations in their
                            entirety, explained the Financial Appendix,<note n="3" xml:id="d353fn3"
                                >Not printed.</note> and summarized the basis on which the Planning
                            Board had arrived at its recommendations. He also pointed out that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff had approved these recommendations. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that he had no
                            further comments to make. (A copy of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s briefing note is filed in the minutes of the
                            meeting.)</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName>’s
                            lengthy briefing, the President said he was puzzled by the statement on
                            page 3 that Turkey was required to maintain forces to protect her
                            southern flank. Was she apprehensive of invasion from that quarter? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that the Turks were much
                            alarmed over the development of Soviet influence and the build-up of
                            forces in Syria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then asked Acting
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Herter</persName> if he
                            had any comments to make. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Herter</persName> replied that the State Department approved the
                            recommendations in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5708, and that
                                <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0738"/>he had no further comments
                            to make. He understood, however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1"
                                >Hollister</persName> had some comments.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> pointed out that
                            paragraph 4–d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5708, while it
                            advised against using the rate of military build-up as a lever to force
                            progress toward Turkish economic stability, did indicate that the rate
                            of military build-up should continue to take account of Turkish
                            capabilities to absorb and support the military program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> then directed the
                            Council’s attention to paragraph 15, which indicated that economic aid
                            of between $100 million and $200 million annually through <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 would be acceptable for planning
                            purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> expressed
                            strong objection to the figure of $200 million. He pointed out that $100
                            million annually was the most we had ever given the Turks in the past,
                            and warned that we could not keep on adding new assistance programs if
                            we did not make cuts elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he was
                            well aware that the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt rather strongly about the
                            need for maintaining Turkish armed forces at the levels that they had
                            recommended. Nevertheless, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> believed that the Turks might well be better off
                            with a smaller elite force. This would release other soldiers for useful
                            activity in support of the Turkish economy. Accordingly, he thought it
                            might be desirable to take another look at the force levels which were
                            being maintained by Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that it would be extremely difficult to achieve
                            the creation of an elite force in Turkey because of the low level of
                            education. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> observed
                            facetiously that what was lacking in Turkey were the advantages of a
                            Harvard education. It was pointed out by other members of the Council
                            that it was precisely this lack which made the Turkish soldiers such
                            tough fighters. The President expressed strong agreement (laughter).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> then pointed out that if
                            changes in Turkish force levels were to be contemplated, these changes
                            would have to be negotiated through <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> channels. He thereupon asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> if he thought that paragraph
                            15 should be revised to indicate more precisely a U.S. objective of
                            keeping U.S. economic assistance to Turkey at a level not exceeding $100
                            million annually. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName>
                            indicated that he certainly did think the paper should specify this, and
                            that it ought to set forth very clearly how poorly the Turks had
                            performed in the past with respect to their promises to undertake
                            necessary economic and financial reforms.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> indicated that
                            he, like Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, had a
                            feeling that the Turks might be able safely to make a slight <pb n="709"
                                xml:id="pg_709" facs="0739"/>reduction in the level of the armed
                            forces they were currently maintaining.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that our policy papers on foreign assistance should
                            state that if the countries we are assisting refuse to do anything
                            whatever to put their own houses in order, we would have to alter our
                            own U.S. position. Help to such countries ought to be conditioned on
                            their willingness to do at least a little something to help themselves
                            if the United States is footing the bill. There were a number of
                            definite steps, continued the President, that the Turks could take in
                            the direction of economic and financial stability. We have been pointing
                            out these steps for years. If the Turks still refuse to take some of
                            these steps, the President was not sure that they could be described, in
                            the words of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5708, as “staunch
                            allies” of the United States. The revised paper on Turkey should
                            therefore say in effect that the United States “assumes” that the Turks
                            will take these steps.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of this problem, the President told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, who was about to
                            see General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>, that he
                            should suggest that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> try to persuade the Turks to accept a lower
                            level for their armed forces.</p>
                        <p>With respect to modifications of the present paragraph 4–d on the rate of
                            military build-up, the President suggested wording to the effect that
                            our military assistance program to Turkey is “based on the assumption
                            that Turkey will make some progress” toward economic and financial
                            stability.</p>

                                of the United States “to secure and protect the territorial

                            inherent doctrine to help everyone possible but in politics hard choice
                            must be made.</p>
                        <p>I replied by stressing great importance US government and people attach
                            to Turkey, and to Turkey’s forthright and steadfast position in free
                            world collective security system. I spoke of Turkey as strong rock of
                                <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, eastern anchor <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and western anchor <gloss

                            King and Prime Minister Libya both to Turkish Prime Minister and acting
                            Foreign Minister, and I mentioned King’s reference to “little Russia”
                            alongside Libya in addition to “big Russia” farther away.</p>
                        <p>Re US adherence <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> I understood great
                            desire have US join but stated that there were certain considerations
                            which conditioned present US decision this regard.</p>
                        <p>Re American doctrine, I stated that it meant what it said, as Turkish
                            Government and people well aware, but that certain other governments
                            might not be so conscious of US intentions re <gloss target="#t_ME1"
                                >ME</gloss> security. Re priorities as among friends, fence sitters
                            and others, I said that we understood his views but that we also feel
                            encouragement USA government to weaker governments in <gloss
                                target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> would have tonic effect on all. A
                            relatively small portion of aid to weak country might create new friend
                            who could join old friends in area. In any case, I added, formulation
                            American doctrine in effect tantamount to US adherence Baghdad Pact
                            since it comprises even further commitments than adherence itself would
                            involve.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Prime Minister interjected that fully appreciative thought
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> was of great value doctrine, and
                            thought his awareness might appear inconsistent with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> desire USA adherence <gloss
                                target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss>, <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0742"
                            />there really no contradiction because other countries do not have same
                            comprehension as Turkey, and might say in effect that those not fully
                            with us are against us.</p>
                        <p>I then stated, on confidential basis, willingness US upon invitation from
                                <gloss target="#t_BP1">BP</gloss> Council to join military
                            committee. I said Prime Minister free to notify other Baghdad Pact
                            members this effect on confidential basis.</p>
                        <p>Underlining financial limitations of plan and extent of area to be
                            included, I referred to regional planning projects including railroad to

                            could discuss these later.</p>
                        <p>I declared US willingness supplement present military program, and
                            Captain Pitts, Defense representative on mission, explained we proposed

                                <item>Receptivity of Turkish Government. The Turkish military will
                                    be receptive to the idea of stationing an American ground force
                                    with an atomic capability in Turkey for substantially the same
                                    reasons that they were receptive to the stationing of a <gloss

                                    and radar unit here. They consider that a ground atomic
                                    capability is required for the survival of Turkey and would
                                    realize that under present conditions too only way in which such
                                    atomic capability could become available to Turkey quickly would
                                    be through the stationing of appropriate US forces in this
                                    country. The Turkish Government is aware that it is going to
                                    receive 2 Honest <persName>John</persName> battalions under the
                                        <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57 program. The Turkish
                                    military will know that these 2 Honest <persName>John</persName>
                                    battalions will be inadequate to provide the degree of fire
                                    support essential to effective defense. They will estimate that
                                    the addition of the atomic capable force under consideration
                                    will greatly enhance their defensive capability and for that
                                    reason will look favorably on the offer. The proposal that the
                                    American unit be phased out of Turkey in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                        >FY</gloss> 60 will serve to reduce such reluctance as the
                                    Turkish Government and people may have to permit foreign
                                    military forces, as such, to be stationed on Turkish territory.

                                    force will ultimately be made available to Turkey, as well as

                                    offer to the Turkish Government would, of course, be
                                    correspondingly increased.</item>

                                <item>Social impact on Turkey. As indicated in paragraph 3B in my
                                    letter to Reinhardt mentioned above although the corrosive
                                    influence necessarily arising from the presence of foreign
                                    troops is comparatively negligible in Turkey at the present
                                    time, it can be expected over a period of years gradually to
                                    grow in Turkey as it would any where else. A force of the size
                                    contemplated in the reference telegram, of course, accelerates
                                    this corrosive influence, moreover the higher standards of
                                    living which would be enjoyed by the American personnel would
                                    probably pose increasingly difficult problems as Turkish
                                    personnel are actually phased into the unit. Such impact in our
                                    view could best be minimized through selection criteria which
                                    would screen carefully American personnel to be sent with the

                                <item>Political and security problems. We do not expect significant
                                    internal political objection to the proposal that an atomic
                                    capable US unit be stationed in Turkey. Several weeks ago the
                                    Soviet Chargé here called on the Deputy Secretary General at
                                    Foreign Office and subsequently on the acting Foreign Minister
                                    regarding the alleged establishment of a US atomic base in
                                    Turkey which he said he had read about in an Istanbul newspaper
                                    and also in an Iranian newspaper. The response he got from the
                                    Foreign Office was that if such a thing were true, a base of
                                    this type was established for the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                            </list></p>
                        <p>We do not envisage any unusual security problems for military units armed
                            with conventional weapons; in the event atomic warheads are stocked in
                            Turkey certain security precautions in regard to storage will become
                            necessary. These security precautions will necessitate screening off
                            certain areas to Turkish personnel and provision of American guard
                            units. We anticipate no problem with the Turkish military on this and in
                            so far as the Government is concerned we are confident it can be handled
                            satisfactorily with the Prime Minister.</p>

                            the participants on the situation in Turkey, According to the notes of

                                    briefly reviewed US relations with Turkey. He said three factors
                                    stand out: 1) the Turkish feeling of friendship for the US and
                                    American people; 2) the accompanying feeling of solidarity with
                                    the US and Turkey’s willingness to gear its foreign policy with
                                    ours; and 3) the realism of Turkey’s appraisal of the events
                                    occurring around it. He called attention to the strength Turkey
                                    draws from its heritage and the respect it enjoys from those
                                    nations which were formerly parts of the Ottoman Empire. He said
                                    he believes the US must continue to extend assistance to the
                                    Turks if they are to continue to maintain their important
                                    strategic position.</p>

                                    prepared to reply to the recent Soviet threats that countries
                                    which permit the stationing of US atomic units on their soil
                                    will be obliterated in a nuclear war. Ambassador
                                        <persName>Warren</persName> said he felt certain the Turks
                                    would make such a statement if the US desires such.” (Department

                                >Menderes</persName> not to be so sticky on the Cyprus problem; a

                        <p>The Ambassador recognizes that there is no likelihood of the US going
                            along with an increase in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            force goals for destroyers from eight to twelve. The present <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ceiling is eight. Should the
                            UK-Turkish arrangements for obtaining four destroyers on a long-term
                            credit not materialize, the US Government may have to consider replacing
                            the four UK Hunt class destroyers on a one a year phased schedule.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Economic Measures</hi></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> has heard from many quarters
                            concerning the need for the Turkish Government to take measures to put
                            its economic house in order. The Ambassador has recognized this need but
                            has pointed out that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName>, as a politician with an election coming in May
                            1958, is unlikely in the next year to take measures Washington
                            authorities consider adequate.</p>

                                <persName>Warren</persName>’s Concerns</hi></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> is very concerned at the attitude
                            he has found in many quarters in Washington to the effect that the Turks
                            are always asking for assistance from the U.S., i.e. $300 million loan,
                                <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0747"/>additional destroyers, more
                            PL 480 wheat, an increase in the US support for their defense budget
                            from 240 million <gloss target="#t_TL1">TL</gloss> to 314 million <gloss
                                target="#t_TL1">TL</gloss>, an additional $30 million in 1947 <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> aid, special treatment on the $4.2
                            million interest payments which have fallen due. He states that the
                            Turks have accepted negative replies in the past and will continue to do
                            so, but Ambassador <persName>Warren</persName> is sincerely concerned
                            that these turndowns will lead to a deterioration in U.S.-Turk relations
                            to the point where the US will not be able to obtain what it wants from
                            Turkey when it wants it. He hopes that Washington authorities have taken
                            into full account the implications of continuing to maintain pressures
                            on the Turks by refusing additional help. He is concerned lest the
                            Turkish officials begin placing a price tag on the facilities that
                            country is offering the US and about the impact such a move might have
                            on U.S.-Turk relations. He is however fully conscious of the fact the
                            aid legislation may have rough sledding on the Hill. He simply hopes
                            that Turkey will receive a fair share of whatever aid the Congress
                            appropriates.</p>

                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 1682) to query

                            appropriately revise Turkish force levels in the light of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> requirements.” He then asked Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> to comment on this
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            he had not been present at the previous Council discussion of the
                            Turkish policy paper, but that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s suggestion was all right with him. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> shared this view, and
                            pointed out that he did not agree with the advice that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> had given to the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> said
                            that it would be very difficult at the present time to initiate any
                            reduction in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-approved Turkish
                            force levels, but he had no objection to leaving in paragraph 28 the
                            phraseology suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> expressed great anxiety about the expenses which
                            were being incurred in Turkey and in similar areas by the Department of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> then expressed
                            great doubt as to whether it was necessary to include the detailed
                            description of the advanced weapons which, according to the text of
                            paragraph 28, we would be supplying to the Turks. It seemed questionable
                            to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> whether
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers should go into such
                            detailed specifications. It was accordingly agreed to remove from
                            paragraph 28 the specific reference to modern weapons, and to substitute
                            general language therefor.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed
                            agreement with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName>’s
                            position, and the President, looking around at the members of the
                            Council, predicted that some day they would all come to believe him when
                            he said that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy reports acted
                            upon by the National Security Council should not be transmitted in their
                            verbatim form to the subordinates of the members of the Council or to
                            our diplomatic establishments abroad.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> and other members of the Council, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR2">Cutler</persName> suggested that paragraph 28,
                            including the portions which the Joint Chiefs of Staff wished to delete,
                            should remain in the policy paper. The President agreed to this
                            suggestion, and made inquiry as to the size and character of over-all US
                            assistance to Turkey. He said he wished the relevant facts in the case
                            in order to write a personal letter to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>. In the ensuing discussion,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1">Radford</persName> pointed out with
                            emphasis that despite the costs, our assistance to Turkey was certainly
                            one of the better bargains for our money. The President said he did not
                            doubt this, but that Turkey, a poor country, could get along better with
                            a smaller and more efficient force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR2"
                                >Cutler</persName> requested Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAM1"
                                >Radford</persName> to supply him with the facts requested by the
                            President for his use in writing to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to delete the final sentence of paragraph 28, as proposed
                            by the Bureau of the Budget.</p>

                                importance, the USSR has exerted political pressures on Turkey and,
                                more recently, offered economic assistance. However, Turkey has
                                rejected these overtures and has remained aligned with the

                                in 1955. Turkey played a vigorous and skillful role in the
                                organization of the Baghdad Pact, in which the United States saw the
                                embodiment of the “Northern Tier” concept. Turkey has subsequently
                                played a leading role in the activities of the Baghdad Pact and has
                                actively urged the United States to adhere to the Pact and give it

                                Turkey has taken an outspokenly pro-Western position in Middle East
                                affairs and has therefore helped to stiffen opposition to
                                ultranationalist and pro-Soviet influence in the area. The Turkish
                                Government has maintained an open distrust of President <persName

                                Egyptian propaganda efforts to weaken the Baghdad Pact. In the Suez
                                Canal controversy, Turkey has stood firmly at the side of the United
                                States. Turkey has viewed with particular concern growing Communist

                                    >NATO</gloss> countries, the United States has a serious concern
                                in the long-standing dispute over the future political status of
                                Cyprus. The population of Cyprus is 4/5 of Greek, and 1/5 of
                                Turkish, origin. Since 1878, Cyprus has been a British colony, in
                                which currently the U.K. maintains a large military force. Because
                                Cyprus is so near the Turkish mainland, and because of concern for
                                the ethnic Turkish minority, Turkey strongly opposes the desire of
                                Greece that the Cypriot population be granted self-determination
                                (which would inevitably result in a union of Cyprus with Greece).
                                The United States has continued to emphasize to the Turks, the
                                Greeks, and the British the need for flexibility in their positions
                                to permit a solution of the problem.</item>

                            <item>Turkey is undergoing one of the most extensive social and
                                political revolutions of modern times. Politically, it is the most
                                stable country in the Middle East. In addition to strong leadership,
                                the stability of Turkey derives in large part from the broad
                                agricultural base of the country, in turn founded on a wide and
                                effective land distribution system. A democratic form of government
                                with a multiparty system is evolving and Western cultural concepts
                                are being developed. But despite its great progress, the
                                transformation of Turkey from a backward oriental despotism to a
                                fully democratic institution is far from complete. Strong
                                limitations on freedom of the press and restrictions on the right of
                                political assembly reflect authoritarian leanings within the
                                government. Strong control by the government of enterprise, its
                                actual operation of certain major economic activities, and its
                                control of labor inhibit the growth of a stable industrial middle

                            <item>Turkey is in the throes of intensive national development which
                                poses serious problems both for Turkey and for the United States in
                                US efforts to assist Turkey. In addition to its military program,
                                the Turkish Government has been attempting to carry out a program of
                                economic growth far in excess of its resources. The gross national
                                product has increased; and the roads, harbors, power plants and
                                factories which have been built should increasingly contribute to
                                Turkey’s economic strength. However, Turkey’s foreign exchange
                                resources are now virtually exhausted and a heavy external debt has
                                been contracted. Some of the investment that has taken place has
                                been misdirected and there appears to have been a considerable
                                flight of capital from the country. Inflation is serious and the
                                exchange rate of the Turkish lira is unrealistic. As internal prices
                                rise and Turkey’s credit standing deteriorates further, it becomes
                                increasingly difficult for Turkey to compete in Western
                                markets.</item>

                            <item>Thus far the Turkish Government has made only limited progress
                                toward restoring economic stability. As a result of US refusal in
                                1955 to provide a $300 million loan without prior economic reforms,
                                recommendations by the International Monetary Fund in 1956, and
                                pressures generated by internal economic and political developments,
                                the Turkish Government imposed some limitations on new investment,
                                bank credits and prices. However, after exhibiting some restraint
                                through the fall of 1956, the Turkish Government has returned to a
                                policy of increased developmental effort. Moreover, Turkey has not
                                developed a comprehensive program which, based on effective
                                utilization of total internal and available external resources,
                                could effectively achieve a reasonable degree of economic stability.
                                Basic measures, particularly a revaluation of the Turkish lira and a
                                slowing up of the development program generally, are required. But
                                it must be recognized that the Turkish Government, especially as the
                                    <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0753"/>elections approach, is
                                unlikely to undertake fundamental economic reforms. Nevertheless,
                                continued US efforts may have some influence on Turkish economic
                                policy and may stimulate efforts to stabilize the economy, even in
                                an election year.</item>

                            <item>In relation to US aid, the United States must face three possible
                                courses of action by the Turks: (a) a continuing refusal to slow
                                down its investment program, to stabilize the economy and to take
                                the necessary corrective action to remove the disparity between
                                internal and external prices; (b.) inconclusive and insufficient
                                actions in these directions; (c) effective actions in these
                                directions. The consequences of either of the first two courses of
                                action will mean continuing balance of payments problems, a slacking
                                off in new foreign credits, both governmental and private, inability
                                to make payments on present heavy foreign indebtedness, shortages of
                                imported items and internal inflation, and external resources
                                requirements which the United States, even if willing, would be
                                unable to meet from limited foreign aid resources. The third course
                                of action could eventually result in greater Turkish economic
                                strength and stability.</item>

                                interest of the United States and Turkey. However, should
                                categorical conditions be attached to the extending of US aid, the
                                Turkish Government might well reject these efforts as an unwarranted
                                intrusion on Turkish sovereignty. Furthermore this action could have
                                the undesirable result of imposing a severe strain on U.S.-Turkish
                                relations and thus could possibly defeat its own objectives. If the
                                United States can influence the Turkish Government toward economic
                                reforms, it will be through persuasion and leadership.</item>

                                missions: To resist direct Soviet attack as part of a concerted
                                allied defense, to withstand an assault by satellite forces, to
                                protect the vitally important Straits, to protect Turkey’s southern
                                flank, and to maintain internal security. Forces capable of
                                achieving these missions should also be capable of providing some
                                support to Turkey’s Baghdad Pact neighbors, Iran and Iraq.</item>

                                forces is the low level of education and technical training which
                                generally prevails throughout the country, for which selective
                                remedies can be provided in the case of the armed forces. This
                                limitation impedes the absorption of additional matériel, which is

                                developed the principal military-economic considerations. The US
                                European Agencies Team has estimated that, to permit the Turkish
                                armed forces to be strengthened in accordance with two alternative
                                plans, a US military aid program of either $500 million or $950
                                million will be required in Fiscal Year 1957–60. The <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Report discussed these
                                alternatives and a modification of one of them, estimating the
                                amount of aid necessary to accomplish minimum US military objectives
                                on an austere basis at $727 million during the four-year period.
                                This estimate, however, was based on an earlier (generally higher)
                                pricing system in the Department of Defense. It provided for some
                                modernization of the Turkish Army in conventional weapons, but did
                                not provide for advanced weapons such as the Honest

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: I have been very much concerned
                            with the adverse economic situation existing in Turkey—a situation that
                            is aggravated by the amount of military force being maintained in that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Turkey has, of course, been extremely anxious to maintain and even
                            increase her military strength and has insistently urged the United
                            States to give her more, rather than less, financial help toward this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>When negotiating with us she always pleads “<gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> force goals.” At the same time, our bilateral aid
                            program for Turkey in effect sets the level of the Turkish contribution
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense.</p>
                        <p>I have studied your letter dealing with this general subject and I am

                        <p>However, there are certain facts of life that must be recognized if we

                            <item>One of these facts is that the nuclear power of the United States

                                and military strength and unity needed to deter the Communists from
                                attempting to take over Western lands by political action or limited

                                within each allied nation are properly related to the impact of

                        <p>Review of Turkish force levels for the past ten years reveals that in
                            1947 the Turkish armed services consisted of some 41 divisions of widely
                            varying active strength and effectiveness, seven fortress commands,
                            small armored and other supporting formations, an air arm totalling
                            roughly 300 operational aircraft and a small navy. Total mobilization
                            strength was about 600,000 men. By 1951 a reorganization led to 19 6/3
                            active divisions, 11 air regiments and 25 ships. Under <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> aegis, Turkish goals for active
                            forces have since increased to 20 8/3 divisions, 41 air squadrons and 64
                            ships. Divisional strengths are roughly comparable to those obtaining in
                            the 1947 time period.</p>
                        <p>Now the significant feature of the Turkish force picture is found in the
                            fact that although the job to be accomplished has remained essentially
                            unchanged, and although Turkey has reaped significant benefits in terms
                            of the overall security provided by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, modernization under our military assistance efforts
                            and protection afforded by the growing United States nuclear retaliatory
                            capability, <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0759"/>her force goals
                            have increased. This to me represents an illogical end result which
                            requires careful reappraisal.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of the impact upon local sensibilities that can result from an
                            attempt to reduce United States supported force levels. On the other
                            hand, it is essential that our limited resources be applied in such
                            fashion as to achieve the greatest possible security for least cost. In
                            this connection, one of my principal responsibilities to the American
                            people is to insure that hard-headed economies are observed in
                            connection with these same security expenditures. Failure on my part to
                            do this could easily result in the collapse of our entire aid program.
                            Exercise of this responsibility leads me to question the need for
                            conventional forces in Turkey of the size now maintained, and our wisdom
                            in supporting these levels.</p>
                        <p>You will appreciate that while my discussion has focused on Turkey, the
                            same general philosophy applies in varying degrees to the total range of
                            our military assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>Greece provides an important example. We must search diligently for more
                            effective application of our resources, recognizing once again that
                            highly expensive and complex modern matériel cannot be injected into the
                            replacement stream without positive indication that the recipient
                            country is capable of its employment and maintenance and that it is, in
                            fact, militarily required as against simpler, less expensive items.</p>
                        <p>We need to see if we cannot, consonant with security, reduce overseas
                            indigenous forces supported by military assistance and persuade our
                            allies to place more reliance on our flexible nuclear capability to
                            protect them from attack. At the same time, we must not foster
                            tendencies on the part of our allies to let down in their support of
                            their appropriate share of the deterrent, weaken the political
                            foundations on which our security is based, or jeopardize the ability of
                            ourselves and our allies to apply limited force effectively and in ways
                            best calculated to avoid local hostilities broadening into general
                            war.</p>
                        <p>It will not, of course, be feasible to single out any one country and
                            impose economies by precipitate unilateral action. Instead, we must
                            point toward phased reductions attuned to careful assessment of
                            collective requirements under the impact of modern weapons systems. The
                            phasing of these reductions will undoubtedly have to vary in relation to
                            the situation in each country concerned. There are different domestic
                            political factors involved in each case. The economic capability of each
                            country also varies, and no standard rule can be established which would
                            cover all. We must make a major effort to persuade those allies whose
                            economies will not support currently programmed military establishments
                            to give greater weight to the nuclear deterrent and get them to try to
                            develop smaller yet <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0760"/>more
                            powerful forces that will meet the requirements of collective
                            security.</p>
                        <p>To give practical expression to these ideas a program of real education
                            will be essential. The fact that we, in the United States, must be
                            prepared to make do with less than we have had in the past is, of
                            course, an essential aspect of this undertaking and should serve as one
                            convincing argument to others. If we are to help increase the military
                            ability of our allies to perform as members of the collective security
                            team, we may well be faced with the choice between reducing our
                            expenditures in support of conventional contingents among the allied
                            forces in order to increase strength in modern weapons and techniques or
                            of reducing our expenditures for advanced weapons for our allies. The
                            question is how we can best go about this without loss of political and
                            military strength of our collective security arrangements. In such a
                            choice, we believe the first alternative by far the better.</p>
                        <p>This letter is for the purpose of giving you an appreciation of the
                            thinking in the American Government and to elicit your comments as to
                            the soundness, from your point of view, of the objectives I have so

                            do not agree with the contents of this letter, I should like you to give
                            me a memorandum of your approach to the same difficult problem, bearing

                            accompany that with a shorter letter of personal comment on the really
                            serious aspect of the problem.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Turks feel that they were given assurances by Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> of a $1 billion
                            program; <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>, in addition,
                            believes he was assured of $200 million a year in discussions with,
                            State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> last year; in addition,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName>, during his
                            tour through the Middle East, promised them a squadron of F–100
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The President said that by maintaining programs of this size we are
                            making it impossible for a country like Turkey to achieve a viable
                            economy—unless we plan to continue defense support for decades into the
                            future. It is clear the Congress does not intend to provide as much
                            money as these programs contemplate. The result can only be collapse and
                            economic depression in Turkey. He stated how much he admires the Turks,
                            but recalls that Pakistan, Korea and others are in the same situation.
                            We must review these programs because the money is just not going to be
                            provided. He is simply trying to be forehanded in the situation. He
                            thought our efforts must be to get them closer to handling their own
                            affairs. He recognized that, on occasion, people have given them hopes
                            or even promises that shouldn’t have been given. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> said the problem is how to sell
                            this matter to <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>. The wrong
                            approach might result in a political “explosion.” The President thought
                            it was definitely up to the United States representatives to do this,
                            and felt that General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            should not have to do it.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> said that the
                            1960–62 study he is preparing might provide an opportunity. He felt that
                            Turkey has, relatively, a stronger defense position than the other
                            sectors of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and that some
                            reduction in forces could be contemplated on this basis. He felt that,
                            if he could pitch his study to reductions resulting from cuts in <pb

                            to advise as to where cuts could be made with least adverse effect. The
                            President said he thought that our authorities should suggest that the
                            Turks go to General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> and
                            ask where they should make cuts. General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName> indicated that the problem is an extremely
                            important one, since we want very strongly to keep <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> on our side. The President
                            recalled that people here wanted to put the burden of the matter on
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> and that he had
                            written the letter himself in order to avoid this. He felt that some
                            change has to be made. He suggested that the Turks should not be
                            permanently dependent on outsiders. General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1"
                                >Norstad</persName>, however, thought that they had no prospect of
                            being able to support substantial forces any time soon.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to Germany, and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> said he thought the Germans
                            would meet the force build-up requirements once they have gotten past
                            the election. The Chancellor told him recently that the trend is still
                            running in his favor. The Germans are taking a very arbitrary stand on
                            disarmament. The Chancellor is campaigning on his support for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a basic issue, and the Germans
                            think that disarmament is contrary to <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. They would actually like to suspend the disarmament
                            talks until the election is over.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName> then said that he
                            was here to appear before the Appropriations Committees on the Mutual
                            Security Bill. His main point would be that, with regard to the Mutual
                            Security Act, the United States is getting a lot of security for this $2
                            billion annual expenditure—security which it could not replace by any
                            available alternative means.</p>
                        <p>In closing, General <persName corresp="#p_NGL1">Norstad</persName>
                            repeated that this letter regarding Turkey should be coming in within a
                            week or ten days. He had simply wanted to have this advance discussion
                            on the problem.</p>

                        <p>Although some officials of the Turkish Government have privately
                            professed to see in recent Turkish-Soviet developments a softer policy
                            on the part of Premier <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            toward the Soviet Union, these developments appear to be superficial
                            tactical shifts designed primarily to increase Turkey’s bargaining power
                            with the United States. In addition, domestic political considerations,
                            particularly the fact that the <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> administration is faced with elections next
                            March if not before, have probably influenced recent Turkish-Soviet
                            relations. Short of endangering national security, Turkey will continue
                            to follow tactics which might obtain from its allies a preferential
                            treatment of its problems and requests.</p>
                        <p>However, it is significant that even Turkey, which is historically,
                            ideologically, and pragmatically committed to a cold war against the
                            USSR, is willing to take advantage of a relaxation in that conflict in
                            order to increase its maneuverability in its relations with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Domestic political considerations are involved because the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> administration is committed to
                            an ambitious economic development program. Turkey’s need of long-term
                            loans or grants has forced it to broaden its commercial contacts because
                            its previous defaults in payment of credit have limited the availability
                            of foreign exchange. Economic necessity is thus forcing Turkey to accept
                            almost any offer that will provide needed capital and equipment. When a
                            Turkish aid request for a glass factory was turned down by the US, the
                            quasi-governmental Turkish Is Bank turned to the USSR and in July 1957
                            received credits of about $10,000,000 for the establishment of two glass
                            factories in Turkey with repayment to be made in goods.</p>

                        <p>Throughout September and October, amidst Syrian and Soviet accusations
                            that Turkish troops, with the support of the United States, were
                            concentrating on the Syrian border in an effort to topple the Syrian
                            regime, Turkish-Syrian relations reached a new low, which threatened a
                            new crisis in the Middle East. In a letter of September 10 to Turkish
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BNA1">Bulganin</persName> alleged that Turkey, in
                            cooperation with the United States, was preparing an attack on Syria.
                            Responding to the Soviet letter, <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> denied the accusations charging that the
                            Soviets were using the Syrian question for their own ends. In an October
                            9 interview with the <hi rend="italic">New York Times,</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> accused Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> of provoking Turkey to
                            attack Syria. The following day the Department of State denied the
                            Soviet charges. Finally on October 16, during a press conference,
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that if the Soviet Union attacked
                            Turkey the United States would not confine itself to a “purely defensive
                            operation.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            November 4, 1957, pages 708–714)</p>
                        <p>The verbal assaults between the United States, the Soviet Union, Turkey,
                            and Syria were accompanied by military and diplomatic maneuvers. On
                            September 21, a Soviet naval squadron visited the Syrian port of
                            Latakia; on October 5 the United States guided-missile carrier <hi
                                rend="italic">Canberra</hi> and other Sixth Fleet vessels arrived in
                            Izmir. On October 13, it was announced in Cairo and Damascus that troops
                            were being sent to Latakia to support the Syrian defense effort.
                            Moreover, the Syrian Foreign Minister brought the matter to the
                            attention of the United Nations requesting on October 16 that the
                            General Assembly place the issue on its agenda. After considerable
                            discussion between October 22 and 30, the General Assembly agreed to
                            take no further action. Syria and Turkey agreed.</p>

                            developments in Syria. We judge that Syria has become or is about to
                            become base for military and subversive activities in <gloss

                            taken by Governments of all five nations bordering on Syria. Latter are
                            deeply concerned over threat to their security represented by impetuous
                            pro-Soviet Syrian regime. Hostile and provocative attitude toward its
                            neighbors adopted by Syrian Government, together with close connection
                            of latter with Government of USSR, reinforces their fear. Already
                            subversive agents carrying explosives have been infiltrated into the

                        <p>This situation seems to carry a special threat to Turkey against which
                            Turkey has taken certain defensive military precautions. The Soviet
                            Union seems however to treat this as a threat against itself and has
                            itself publicly threatened Turkey suggesting that it will mass troops on

                                informed the Department that he had conveyed the substance of this

                                provoking a war. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        <p>Ambassador Ürgüplü felt the main problem now affecting East-West
                            relations was the Arab-Israeli problem. He expressed his serious concern
                            at Israeli’s constant population growth and felt that its need to expand
                            territorially would continue to exacerbate the Arab-Israeli problem.</p>
                        <p>As to Turkey, the Ambassador pointed out that although anti-Russian
                            feelings are very strong among the people, the situation cannot be taken
                            for granted. The high cost of living, the shortages of imported
                            commodities, and the heavy defense expenditures are affecting people’s
                            thinking. Although most recent USSR economic offers have been turned
                            down by the Turkish Government it is a question as to how long these
                            offers can be resisted.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador concluded by stating that he wanted to be frank and paint
                            an honest picture of the situation as he saw it personally. The Turks
                            will not be discouraged and will effectively <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737"
                                facs="0767"/>resist the Russians, but it is now a fact that the USSR

                            hope that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> agrees that in view of
                            recent developments, particularly in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            no action should be taken which enemies of Turkey could use as attempt
                            to demonstrate that charges have substance. In particular, we would
                            suggest that every effort be made to insure that Turkish forces now
                            located along Turkish southern border be deployed in such way as to
                            minimize possibility of incidents arising from their disposition.</p>

                            consider Syria as acting under Soviet guidance. Russia’s age-old desire
                            to reach warm water is sufficient motivation in Turkish minds for any
                            USSR anti-Turk move.<note n="4" xml:id="d368fn4"><p>In telegram 788,
                                    October 19, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1"
                                        >Thompson</persName> reported from Moscow that the Soviets
                                    were “genuinely concerned” about preventing the overthrow of the
                                    Syrian Government. The Ambassador expressed doubt that Soviet
                                    interests in Syria were in themselves of “sufficient importance”
                                    to warrant the risks involved in recent Soviet actions.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> noted that
                                    among Soviet objectives in the Middle East were the desire for
                                    expansion toward the Persian Gulf and a desire to break the
                                    “chain of US alliances” around the Soviet Union. The Ambassador
                                    added:</p>
                                <p>“The key to both these objectives would appear to be Turkey,
                                    which has received considerable Soviet attention in recent
                                    months. In addition to the blatant carrot and stick approach to
                                    Turkey it seems likely that recent Rumanian proposal for a
                                    Balkan Pact may have had as its primary objective the political
                                    isolation of Turkey. I suspect Soviets have hoped that their
                                    blustering attitude would cause US to waver in support of Turkey
                                    with consequent softening up of Turkey for direct Soviet
                                    approach to the country. While their actions could be explained
                                    as preparation for an attack on Turkey I consider this most
                                    unlikely.” (Department of State, Central Files, 682.83/
                                    10–1957)</p>

                        <p>The conversation also made abundantly clear to me that Turks realize that
                            Syrian situation is so great concern other Arab States. <persName

                            situation now facing Turks. I believe we can be assured that in light of
                            recent developments Turks are not going to take any action which enemies

                                <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0772"/>King Saud’s embarrassment
                            over Syria’s refusal to mediate; and that our delegations should work
                            more closely together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>, after agreeing that
                            it was important for us to consult and establish a concerted position by
                            Friday, then went on to explain why the United States felt that it had
                            been desirable at yesterdays’s UNGA debate to concentrate on the Saudi
                            offer. He said that there were two principal reasons for this. In the
                            first place, it was consonant with the Secretary’s position that this
                            was a regional problem; this had prompted him to defer his plan to put
                            in a resolution that would refer the matter to the Security Council and
                            call for an investigation that would be broad enough to include the
                            activities of the USSR. Within this context it was logical to accept the
                            Saudi offer,<note n="3" xml:id="d369fn3">Documentation on King Saud’s
                                interest in mediating the Syrian-Turkish dispute is in Department of
                                State, Central File 682.83.</note> particularly in view of the fact
                            that Syria had declined the Saudi offer under circumstances that were a
                            measure in themselves of the extent to which Syria was under Russian
                            influence. The second general consideration was the forthcoming Turkish
                            elections. Because of the preoccupation of top Turkish officials with
                            the election, it was felt that it would be better to defer any debate on
                            this subject until they were over. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                >Rountree</persName> said that these tactics had been partly
                            successful, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> was
                            now working on the statement that he would make Friday, and that our
                            delegation would be in active contact with the Turkish delegation in New
                            York. Later in the conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                                >Rountree</persName> assured the Ambassador that he would telephone
                            to New York to assure that effective liaison was maintained between our
                            two delegations.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the foregoing discussion, the Ambassador made a number
                            of other observations. He urged that we coordinate with the British, but
                            went on to deplore the excessive British reliance on <persName
                                corresp="#p_NBM1">Nuri</persName> Said in recent years. It had, he
                            asserted, the effect of alienating from the West other Iraqi leaders who
                            could have been useful to us. He also expressed a deep distrust of Arabs
                            generally, citing particularly the chain of events and public statements
                            following King Saud’s recent visits to Damascus and Beirut. In the
                            course of a plea that the United States should join the Baghdad Pact, he
                            suggested that Iraq might be allowed to leave the Pact. When Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> pointed out that
                            this would be regarded as a major victory for <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the Ambassador discounted this,
                            asserting that this could be neutralized by the United States joining
                            the Pact, and could be further neutralized by the way it was conveyed to
                            the Arabs. Throughout the discussion, the Ambassador’s comments carried
                            overtones of not only the need for more effective liaison among our
                            friends, particularly at the United Nations at the present time, but <pb
                                n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0773"/>also that we could and should
                            be doing a great deal more among the Arab states.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum is limited to an assessment in broad terms of how a
                                <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> victory, whether by a narrow or
                            large majority, might affect Turkish actions, and what a defeat of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_RPP1"
                                >RPP</gloss>, or the <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss>–<gloss
                                target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> might augur.</p>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> victory with a large majority would
                            be construed as a personal victory for <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> and his policies. In this instance, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> probably would continue his
                            present foreign and domestic policy lines without significant change. On
                            the basis of past experience, it is doubtful if he would use the
                            prestige of such a victory to liberalize the press and assembly laws,
                            effect significant economic reforms or make compromises that would
                            foster a solution of the Cyprus problem.</p>

                        <p>In the case of a <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> victory with a small
                            majority, there is no reason to believe that there would be a change in
                            the field of foreign affairs. On the domestic side, internal political
                            struggle would be intensified and <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> might react vindictively to the loss of
                            prestige of a significantly reduced majority. An assessment of how he
                            would be likely to deal with domestic problems would have to await a
                            tally of those <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> candidates elected
                            since the degree of loyalty of the party deputies and party discipline
                            would bear on the degree of political support within the party <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> would receive for the
                            continuation of present domestic policies. Even in the case of a victory
                            with a reduced majority, <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            may not consider himself seriously handicapped because the <gloss
                                target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>, both through earlier resignations and
                            the selection of the present deputorial candidates, has lost a number of
                            the outspoken critics of <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName>
                            within the Democrat Party. Thus, even with a reduced majority, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> may feel that he has a larger
                            loyal core of Democrat Party members in the new <gloss target="#t_GNA1"
                                >GNA</gloss> and can safely press on with present policies.</p>
                        <p>A victory for the <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss>, whether alone or
                            in cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss>, would result
                            in a difficult period of transition. During that time, positive action
                            on major issues, domestic and foreign, might be difficult to obtain. In
                            its campaign the <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> has promised to (1)
                            amend the constitution and create an upper chamber in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GNA1">GNA</gloss>; (2) abolish repressive legislation;
                            and (3) hold elections in May 1958 under new electoral laws. If these
                            measures are undertaken, it may create an unsettled situation in Turkey
                            for the immediate months ahead.</p>
                        <p>In foreign policy matters, the <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> under
                            Inonu can be expected to continue the present Turkish Government’s
                            pro-Western line. However, Inonu may again display the high degree of
                            independence which has characterized his career since 1923. He may also
                            be more intractable on the Cyprus problem. He has been critical of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> for advocating
                            partition as a solution to the Cyprus question, claiming that this
                            policy is a retreat from that of maintenance of the status quo or
                            reversion of sovereignty to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The economic policies of the <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> under
                            the leadership of Inonu (or of an <gloss target="#t_RPP1"
                                >RPP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> cooperation) may be
                            expected to be conservative. Inonu will probably be prepared to consider
                            reducing the rate of investment, initiating stabilization measures, and
                            introducing more planning in Turkey’s economic development. There will
                            be, however, a temptation to step up imports over the short-run to meet
                            critical consumer shortages and solidify the government’s position with

                        <p>1395. When on a few minutes notice I saw Prime Minister this morning for
                            first time since elections about an urgent matter (<gloss

                                    <persName>Warren</persName> informed the Department that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> did not attend
                                the reception for Italy’s President as the Ambassador had expected.
                                    <persName>Warren</persName> noted that he would find the first
                                opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister regarding his suggestion
                                about deployment of troops upon the completion of maneuvers. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 782.54/11–1357)</note>), he began
                            conversation by saying he wanted mention to me a matter that would be
                            known only to him and me. (We were alone for entire conversation.) He
                            said during next few days he will be making up his new cabinet. During
                            many past months he has found pressure on himself for handling foreign
                            affairs to be far too much. He must have a competent Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs, one who has his confidence. Etem Menderes already has an
                            appropriate portfolio (Minister of Public Works) and lacks the
                            experience demanded of a competent Minister of Foreign Affairs. The only
                            member of the Grand National Assembly with the required knowledge and
                            experience to be Foreign Minister who has Prime Minister’s confidence is
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Fatin Rustu Zorlu</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> added that he had
                            been told variously that <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> as
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs would not be pleasing to the US. He stressed
                            how important it is that he be relieved of the pressure from the work of
                            the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and how essential it is that the Foreign
                            Minister be one who could loyally and enthusiastically support his
                            policy of fullest cooperation and collaboration with USA. He asked me
                            what I thought about his appointing <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I said I was of course speaking without consulting my government and made
                            clear that what I said must be considered in that <pb n="746"

                            I thought I knew my government and American people and expressed myself
                            thus: <list>

                                <item>The US would want him to select his cabinet on basis of

                                <item>I had found <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> able,
                                    intelligent, cooperative and friendly to USA during recent

                                <item>The only reservation I could think of which might occur to

                                        >Zorlu</persName> might harbor resentment toward US because
                                    of his failure to get the $300 million loan some years
                                    ago.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> replied he could assure me
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1">Zorlu</persName> harbors no such
                            resentment. On the contrary, <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> came back and reported to him that he not get the
                            loan for $300 million but he did get immediately $30 million which was
                            what Turkey then and there seriously needed.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister continued that <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> not only harbors no resentment but that he is
                            friendly towards the US, believes in the US, champions the present
                            policy of closest relations with the US, and will do everything possible
                            advance the closest most friendly relations between two countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> then said that a few days
                            will elapse before he will complete his cabinet. He suggested that I
                            convey this message to the Department. I am sure he would like the
                            Department’s reaction within 24 hours if that be possible.</p>

                            must give convincing proof of a change of heart. Mr. <persName

                            should stop trying to overthrow the Jordan Government. The President

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> said that
                            we must not accept a fait accompli in Syria. The President thought that
                            there might be some possibility of hopeful developments there. He knew
                            how staunchly Turkey had opposed the Communist penetration of Syria. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> said that Turkey was
                            gratified by the way the United States had stood by Turkey. The USSR had
                            not failed to notice this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> commented that

                            Turkey and had said that his recent talks with the President and the

                            had been most satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> said that Turkey had
                            no illusion about <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s abilities to
                            be helpful in the Middle East. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was
                            divided, but US policy must continue strong in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MA1"
                                >Menderes</persName> thought of the military situation in Syria. The
                            Prime Minister said that the Russians have sent Syria more arms than
                            Syria can use. The Soviets have not made Syria into a Communist
                            satellite yet, because they are afraid of public reaction in the Arab
                            world. They have put their hand on Syria, however, and can come in at
                            any time.</p>

                        <p>Speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"
                                >Zorlu</persName> said that Turkey needed US support to help it
                            overcome its economic difficulties. Turkey was grateful for what the US
                            had already done. She was now taking measures to improve her budgetary
                            situation and control inflation, and hoped the US would help her in this
                            task. The US should speed up the current aid which has not yet been
                            received, and give increased aid in addition.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that, with US help, in around three years Turkey
                            would be in very good shape. Russian pressure made it more urgent than
                            ever that Turkish economic measures be successful. The three-year
                            drought had been a severe blow. The problem of the increase in
                            population was also involved, added Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZFR1"

                        <p>The Secretary said that he was aware of the statement Mr. <persName

                                <persName>Warren</persName> about the measures the government would
                            take to stabilize the economy.<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">In telegram

                                    >Menderes</persName> on December 10, the Prime Minister had
                                requested the Ambassador to inform his government that Turkey was
                                taking steps to “lower price structure” and to “stabilize Turkish
                                money”. <persName corresp="#p_MA1">Menderes</persName> also noted
                                that the recent elections had revealed an increase in “Communist
